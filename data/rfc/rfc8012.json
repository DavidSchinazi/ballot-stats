BTW, the above is a nice description that would have been nice to see sooner in the text. The draft then says:  This document does not itself introduce \u00a0  any new security considerations. Isn't there anything that should be said about risks with the extended capabilities to discover and exercise ECMP paths?\u00a0 Does this help network reconnaissance?\u00a0 Does it help attackers to have this additional information?\u00a0 If it doesn't, please explain why and that will clear up this discuss or adding text would be good.\u00a0 Thanks.",
