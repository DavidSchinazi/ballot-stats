        "text": "Inclusion of an \"implementation requirement\" column in the IANA registries implies a need for a defined procedure to make changes to existing registrations.\u00a0 With only a \"specification required\" procedure, it seems there would need to be a \"change controller\" column as well. Furthermore, is it expected that anyone with any specification could set, e.g., an implementation requirement of \"MUST\"?\u00a0 It seems like this attribute might be better left for the RFCs defining the protocol, to be modified by an updating RFC... If we are to retain the Implementation Status appendix in the final RFC, the boilerplate will need some changes, and I think those changes should get review prior to AUTH48.\u00a0 For example, \"at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft\" will make no sense in an RFC, and the relationship to  RFC 7942  is not quite as clear given that we diverge from its recommendations.\u00a0 \"[A]ssist the IETF in its decision process\" does not seem to apply after the IETF has made its decision, though the disclaimer about endorsement seems highly important to retain. This seems to be related to Roman's Discuss point, but the document seems to be inconsistent as to the primary purpose of the mechanism -- Section 1.1 says that it is to verify \"authenticity\" of a stand-alone zone, whereas the Introduction implies that \"integrity\" is primary (with authenticity as an add-on \"when used in combination with DNSSEC), and the Abstract refers to \"accuracy and completeness\".\u00a0 In particular, it is easy to read references to \"integrity\" (and, indeed, the Abstract itself) as referring to something akin to a transport checksum instead of a cryptographic message integrity code.\u00a0 I think the document needs to be much more clear, and consistent, about what properties it aims to provide.\u00a0 (I do not believe that the \"authenticity\" property can be provided without DNSSEC, and Roman covers the cryptographic integrity case in his ballot position.)",
