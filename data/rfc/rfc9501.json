But, I am ambivalent on this document: it is of course good will to offer a free access, but it is also a little 'hand waving' to the IETF LLC that must both avoid loss and offer free access. Hence my ABSTAIN ballot. I am also puzzled by the first paragraph of section 2 ending with `about the registration fee structure for fully online meetings` while the document appears to be for hybrid and fully online meetings.

        "text": "Thank you for the work on this document. Many thanks to John Klensin for his in depth review:  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/art/9Nv4gQqKizP8yIJH8qb07nTxQd4/ , and to the authors and others for replying to it. I believe that there is value in publishing a high level principle document as a direction to LLC, even though I also understand that there is some intrinsic ambiguity with writing such a document. The line is hard to draw. I'm balloting DISCUSS to go over the points below, which I really believe are worth addressing. I tried to be as actionable as possible. * The reference to \"Observer\" as is in the document does not add much, and rather makes it unclear as the role of \"observer\" is not explicitly defined (neither in this document nor on  RFC 3935 ). I would have liked this document to also specify the observer role and that the free observer option should also be supported as much as possible, however I seem to understand it out of scope for this document (a shame really, since it is so close to the topic). I suggest to just remove \"(in contrast to an \"observer\")\" and hope that someone will find the energy to pick up the topic and bring it to shmoo. * The document should give guidance to the LLC keep the identities of those who have have applied for fee waivers and any information that may be disclosed by those applications confidential. Mirja said \"However, my assumption is that individual registration data (except the name in the participants list) is treated as confidential anyway\" so then why not just state it in this document and make it explicit. In practice, I like John's suggestion of the following text or something of the sort be added:  \u00a0 \u00a0  > \"if someone applies for a fee waiver, the LLC is expected to collect the absolutely minimum amount of information required to allow...\" (whatever it is they decide they need to allow) \"and the community will be told what information is to be collected so that potential applicants can made informed decisions\" * I understand that it was a conscious choice and that the sentence was discussed quite a bit, however I also think the following sentence in section 3 does not give any guidance to the LLC, and is in general just unclear: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 > If unlimited free remote participation is determined to adversely affect the number of paying participants or the cost of free participation emerges to be a signification factor, the LLC might implement additional measures to manage these costs.  I believe some clarification is sorely needed as to what additional measures are envisioned (I believe this was also one of Roman's points). Somewhere in the discussion, Mirja said: \"But we didn\u2019t want to rule out anything because if it\u2019s a problem for the financial viability of the IETF, it really goes beyond the scope of this document to give explicit guidance.\" It is strange to make a guidance document not give any guidance at all here...",

However, the document is not explicit about this, and indeed there are also some hints in the opposite direction, like where section 3 mentions \u201capplying for a fee waiver\u201d.

Fundamentally, I think that this document would be better to specify lower minimum requirements of what free access *must* be provided, and set out aspirational goals of what is desirable, but leave room for the LLC/IESG at the time to determine how those are best implemented based on current circumstances.\u00a0 Specifically, I entirely agree that anyone should be able to participate in the standards process without paying any fees.\u00a0 I.e., I fully support this text: \u00a0  The principle this document states is simple: there must always be an \u00a0  option for free remote participation in any IETF meeting, regardless \u00a0  of whether the meeting has a physical presence. Aspirationally, I agree that we should aim for remote participants to have the same remote access experience as for paid remote attendee, i.e., I am supportive of the current fee-waver process that we have today.\u00a0 However, I don't agree with following text using must, because I just see it as constraining the IESG/LLC in a way that could be detrimental to the financial health of the IETF. \u00a0  Further, in order to fully remove barriers to participation, any free \u00a0  registration option must offer the same degree of interactivity and \u00a0  functionality available to paid remote attendees.",

I believe that *all* IETF participation should be free - but then again I also believe that cookies should be larger, taxes should be abolished, cancer should be eradicated, everyone should have a fluffy kitten and those annoying blister packs that batteries come in should be required to have a pull tab. Unfortunately I'm not in a position to make these decisions - apparently some of them are technically infeasible, some have funding issues, some of them have been delegated to other groups (like governments), and most worryingly of all, some people claim to prefer puppies. We already have a principle that the IETF should be open to participation from all, and we already have an LLC and Executive Director to whom we've delegated annoying things like making sure that we can actually pay the bills. I believe that we should trust these groups to do their jobs, and that it is not appropriate for me to try teach them to suck eggs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_grandmother_to_suck_eggs ) Now, if y'all want to discuss the whole kitten and blister pack topics...",
