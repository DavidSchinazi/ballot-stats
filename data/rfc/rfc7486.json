This document would benefit from some section somewhere giving a set of clear, numbered steps, saying who sends, who receives, and who does what with what input at each step.\u00a0 I don't find Section 5 to be doing that at all.\u00a0 \"the client authenticates by signing a blob of information as described in the previous sections,\" still leaves me wondering what blob was signed, and sent how. And yes, I see that \"blob\" is used elsewhere, but it's not a technical term. Some other, easier-to-deal-with things for discussion, some of which might just involve small clarifications (or an explanation to me that results in my slapping my own forehead): -- Section 2 -- In the ABNF for HOBA-TBS, is something supposed to be between the elements?\u00a0 If not, how do I know when the base64 value for nonce ends and the length value for alg begins? -- Section 6.3 -- \u00a0  The server SHOULD also revoke or delete any cookies associated with \u00a0  the session. Why is that not MUST?\u00a0 How good is a \"logout\" if stolen cookies from that session can still be reused? -- Section 6.4 -- Protocol: does asking for and getting a new challenge affect the session state?\u00a0 The document should be clear about what happens, rather than just saying that the client can ask for a new challenge.\u00a0 Is it like a logout and re-login?\u00a0 Or what? -- Section 8.2 -- I don't think you need to say \"a la LinkedIn,\" and I think it's a bad idea to have us link a company's name to a password compromise forever in an RFC.\u00a0 Especially when it's not necessary.",
