Thus is surely not the case. The requirement is that all packets for a particular MPLS-TP LSP must use a common EL value, but other MPLS-TP LSP may use a different value, and indeed there is good reason to encourage them to do so. I think that you later get to this point, but I find the text that you are using to build the case for the ELI quite confusing. \"MPLS-TP LSPs can be carried as client LSPs within an MPLS server LSP if an Entropy Label Indicator (ELI) and Entropy Label (EL) is pushed below the server layer LSP label(s) in the label stack, just above the MPLS-TP LSP label entry [ RFC6790 ].\" I think that you need to clarify that this does not mean that the client needs to do this, the server can and\u00a0 should do it. \"An MPLS-TP LSP must not traverse a server layer MPLS LSP which traverses any form of multipath not supporting termination of the entropy search at the EL label.\" Surely that is a protocol correctness MUST NOT? Then I think in the next sentence \"the ingress LSR MUST be aware.\" There surely needs to be a requirements and some discussion on bi-directional co-routing, since this is not natural in MPLS.  \"however a change in path should not occur solely for load balancing.\" Since this is saying - please don't do it because you will break MPLS-TP's invariant, I think that needs SHOULD NOT with appropriate sentence rewording if needed.",
