The text seems reasonable. It would be helpful if there was a reference to \"Address-Dependent Filtering\", which might be  RFC 4787 . The main risk to the mapping method seems to be a threat of overlapping address mappings, such that return packets are delivered to the wrong user. This would be a security consideration if users received other users traffic. The algorithm seems designed to avoid this, at least Appendix B indicates this as a requirement. If this is in fact believed to guarantee non-overlapping mappings then this should be stated in this section. The only statement I can find is in Section 5.1, where it is stated that \"Different PSIDs guarantee non-overlapping port-sets.\" But if I'm not mistaken, the PSIDs are also computed so this might not actually be a guarantee. If there was a proof of correctness ensuring that a correct implementation will ensure non-overlapping mappings then this should be mentioned as well.",
