My concern is that this data model appears to only support minimal or almost-no security variants of various protocols, which seems a shame for hosts that are going to be managed. If that's all be considered by all the right folks, that's fine, but I'm worried that it has not.

(2) 2.2: Is nothing else needed to support secure NTP?\u00a0 If more is needed, why not support that? (3) 2.3: Why not support RADIUS/TLS or radext-dtls? That would be needed in order to not send RADIUS usernames and passwords in clear out the other side of the box?\u00a0 That'd require a flag to say to use such a mechanism and some trust anchor information. (4) 2.3: Similar question about SSH, ssh_config [1] has many more settings, why aren't any of those needed? \u00a0  [1]  http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&sektion=5 (5) 2.4: Wouldn't DNSSEC trust anchor support be needed here? Assuming that the public DNSSEC root is used everywhere within enterprises where this might be used seems odd, since such enterprises would probably have to operate a private root for at least internal DNS names. Even if trust anchor public key inforamation is not needed here, wouldn't some DNSSEC settings be needed to configure DNSSEC validation on or off? (6) 3.5.1: What's the semantics of setting SSH public keys here - are those added to the existing set or do they replace the current set (associated with an account)? The former is problematic as getting rid of old SSH keys is an ongoing problem. The latter creates the potential to brick a machine. Either would seem to call for more text and not saying seems worse than saying;-) Maybe this is determined by some more basic part of yang though, not sure?",

(The LC went out quite early in the new year and didn't generate any comment that I can see, so maybe we should get a bit more review?) (2) 2.2: Is nothing else needed to support secure NTP?\u00a0 If more is needed, why not support that? (3) 2.3: Why not support RADIUS/TLS or radext-dtls? That would be needed in order to not send RADIUS usernames and passwords in clear out the other side of the box?\u00a0 That'd require a flag to say to use such a mechanism and some trust anchor information. (4) 2.3: Similar question about SSH, ssh_config [1] has many more settings, why aren't any of those needed? \u00a0  [1]  http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh_config&sektion=5 (5) 2.4: Wouldn't DNSSEC trust anchor support be needed here? Assuming that the public DNSSEC root is used everywhere within enterprises where this might be used seems odd, since such enterprises would probably have to operate a private root for at least internal DNS names. Even if trust anchor public key inforamation is not needed here, wouldn't some DNSSEC settings be needed to configure DNSSEC validation on or off? (6) 3.5.1: What's the semantics of setting SSH public keys here - are those added to the existing set or do they replace the current set (associated with an account)? The former is problematic as getting rid of old SSH keys is an ongoing problem. The latter creates the potential to brick a machine. Either would seem to call for more text and not saying seems worse than saying;-) Maybe this is determined by some more basic part of yang though, not sure?",
