        "text": "Section 3.1: \u00a0  A DetNet system security designer relies on the premise that any \u00a0  resources allocated to a resource-reserved (OT-type) flow are \u00a0  inviolable, in other words there is no physical possibility within a \u00a0  DetNet component that resources allocated to a given flow can be \u00a0  compromised by any type of traffic in the network; this includes both \u00a0  malicious traffic as well as inadvertent traffic such as might be \u00a0  produced by a malfunctioning component, for example one made by a \u00a0  different manufacturer. Can we really ensure that a malfunctioning component can't compromise the resources of another one. The most simple example I would have is a router with a malfunction rewriting the destination address or flow label of a packet causing the packet to change the flow it is belonging too, thus if occurring for any significant amount of packets causing overflow in the next hop router when the original and the remarked flow compete for the same resources assigned. The only way to ensure that this happens is to verify a strong header integrity protection at each point a decision on how to forward, classify or remark the flow is done. So Section 3.3 indicate that this is an issue, but only discusses how it can be solved over ethernet. This issue hasn't been well handled in either the MPLS or IP detnet data planes as no additional mechanism was required to ensure this criteria is meet.  So I think the requirement that also malfunctions in equipment don't result in flow violations is hard, and will require that the already approved data plane specification needs additional mechanism that verify all data used on each occasion the data is used. Neither MPLS nor IP as currently specified fulfill this, not even against non-malicious malfunctions or corruption type malfunctions. Then we have those malfunction that breaks the network or where control plane information provided is being corrupted.  I have only looked a bit deeply on one type of malfunction that I know that can occur. I convinced that this document will indicate a number of additional potential ways things can go wrong that can't be determined without additional mechanisms and likely additional per packet fields. Thus, I think we need to discuss if the security properties matches the actual approved data plane, or if the property is so important that the data plane specification is moved back to the WG to be fixed?  I would also recommend that you don't indicate that a different manufacturer can be blamed. Isn't a malfunction going to occur where they occur, it is not like a single vendor network will be without malfunctions due to hardware issue, nor have its set of software bugs.  Section 9.1: \u00a0  The IP protocol has a long history of security considerations and \u00a0  architectural protection mechanisms.\u00a0 From a data plane perspective \u00a0  DetNet does not add or modify any IP header information, so the \u00a0  carriage of DetNet traffic over an IP data plane does not introduce \u00a0  any new security issues that were not there before, apart from those \u00a0  already described in the data-plane-independent threats section \u00a0  Section 5, Security Threats. The above requirement from Section 3.1 in regards to IP header fields used for flow classification are not automatically fulfilled without additional mechanisms. Thus, I would claim that DETNET unless Section 3.1 requirement is minimized will require support for a strong integrity mechanism over all headers. So if this needs to be keyed or not is totally dependent on if malicious modifications of packet headers needs to be taken into account or not.  Section 9.2:  Same as previous issue but for integrity over the MPLS headers.",
