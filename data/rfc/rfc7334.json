I have one simple point of DISCUSSion about the code point assignment in the RP Object Flag Field registry.\u00a0 I see from the archive that it does appear to have been discussed in the working group -- there's an unfortunate lack of any record of discussion after working group adoption (though much discussion before), but the registration request was removed in -04, and then put back in in -06 after Adrian's review.\u00a0 Here's my question: The RP Object Flag Field registry only has 18 bits left, and you aim to take one of them for this experiment, for which the shepherd writeup notes that \"Implementation beyond prototype is not clear.\"\u00a0 Do you really want to take up a permanent bit just for this, even if the experiment turns out to fail (or to be unimplemented or undeployed)? Might it be better to allocate a bit for experimental use, and to use that for this experiment, allowing use of that same bit for other experiments as well?\u00a0 It would mean that if this one does take off, you'd have to switch later to a non-experimental bit.\u00a0 Or are you really quite sure that this *will* take off, and you'll need the bit for sure?\u00a0 (Or, alternatively, are you quite sure that 18 bits is well and truly enough, and you don't care?)",
