I echo Jari's discuss which was also an issue identified in the secdir review. [1] I do however also appreciate Martin's explanation that the spec as-is has some utility, and I also really welcome the author's willingness to publish this, but I think the situation needs to be clarified in section 1. Since I'm not sure what does or doesn't work without the security bits I can't suggest text unfortunately but I'd say a note along these lines in section 1, and an accompanying bit of text somewhere else with details of how to work without the security bits would do. I think something like that additional section is really needed though since I can't see how you get even insecure interop as-is. If adobe or the authors were also willing to say \"and we plan to publish the security bits in a future specification\" that'd be even better. (Note: I'm not trying to insist on that, I realise promises like that might be hard to make.) Another alternative might be to hold this draft until the security bits can be filled in. I could understand if the authors would rather not do that, but it might be easier than defining an insecure-but-interoprable version of this protocol. Personally, I'd prefer that if it were possible since putting out an RFC with only a null/null ciphersuite well-defined seems a bit off. \u00a0  [1]  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg04045.html",
