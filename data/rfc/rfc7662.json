What is meant by the \"appropriateness\" of the token?  In general if we're talking about a piece of data that could be sensitive like client IP address, it would be better for there to be specific guidelines to direct protected resources as to when this information needs to be sent. I note that Section 5 basically says such considerations are out of scope, but if this specific example is to be provided here then they seem in scope to me. = Section 5 = \"One way to limit disclosure is to require \u00a0  authorization to call the introspection endpoint and to limit calls \u00a0  to only registered and trusted protected resource servers.\" I thought Section 2.1 made authorization to call the introspection endpoint mandatory. This makes it sound like it's optional. Which is it?",

In initial discussion Justin says that GET is \"a deployment optimization that some servers will offer\", and \"The OAuth client might know through configuration (assuming a tighter coupling than defined by the interoperable protocol),\" to which I responded thus: 1. Why is GET an optimization?\u00a0 It has privacy disadvantages, and I don't see any advantages. 2. This \"tight coupling\" thing is something that I think weakens the interoperability of the OAuth protocol in general, and I've never liked it.\u00a0 In this case, in particular, I don't see any advantage to it, and I don't understand why it's useful to have an option that only works if you have inside knowledge, for no benefit. Why is it ever good to have clients that only work with certain servers, when it's just as easy to make sure that all clients work with all servers?",
