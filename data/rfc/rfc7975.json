        "text": "(1) There is some ambiguity in the document about whether the uCDN passes the IP address of the UA or its prefix to the dCDN. Sec 4.4.1 says that for DNS redirection, the uCDN passes \"IP address or prefix\" of the UA, but then in the definition of resolver-ip specifies it only as the IP address of the UA. Then in Sec 4.5.1 for HTTP redirection the equivalent field is specified as the IP address of the UA and the possibility of sending only a prefix is not mentioned. Then 5.2 has the para that begins \"While it is technically possible to mask some information in the RI Request, such as the last bits of the UA IP address ...\" which makes it seem like prefixes really shouldn't be sent. I think the document needs some consistency and clarity here about whether prefixes are expected to be used for either redirection method. It's also not obvious to me why the document shouldn't recommend to uCDNs that if they are polling multiple candidate dCDNs as described in Sec 5.2, they should use only a prefix for such requests. The arguments given against this seem pretty thin -- isn't preventing correlation of multiple requests to a single UA a good thing, especially when it's being done by a bunch of dCDNs? And I don't understand the CGN example -- isn't the root of the problem here that topologically dispersed UAs are sharing the same public-facing IP address, in which case the dCDN may have the same problem when passed a full IP address as it does a prefix?  (2) Ben noted the weakness of the recommendation in 5.1 regarding TLS. I see that the language here is the same as it is in draft-ietf-cdni-logging-22. But I thought the agreement on that document was MUST use TLS, full stop. So there is ambiguity in both documents I think. \"In an environment where ...\" and \"When TLS is used ...\" seem inconsistent with \"TLS MUST be used ....\" I'm happy to clear on this if I'm missing something from the previous discussion, which I think happened when I was on leave and resulted from one of Stephen's ballots.",

I fail to see why that is an acceptable approach. Can you point me at where the WG disucssed the issues with that approach and considered less security/privacy unfriendly potential alternatives?\u00a0  Some examples: - section 4.1 says \"SHOULD convey as much information as possible\" that is surely wrong - there is no reason to encourage sending cookies and other security/privacy sensitive information and in fact sending such should be discouraged (SHOULD NOT) or even, if possible, prohibited (MUST NOT).\u00a0  - The cs-(cookie) in 4.5.1 is one specific case of sending too much.\u00a0  - 4.4.1 Resolver IP addr is liable to be that of an end user's machine (if they operate a recursive).
