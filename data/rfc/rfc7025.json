It sounds like: \"hey, let's put a MIB to satisfy the OPS ADs.\" Are you really going to manage GMPLS PCE deployment with a read-only MIB module.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pce-pcep-mib-04  and  RFC 4802  are both read-only. This section is not about management, it's just monitoring. The WG should review  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5706 , and tell us how they plan on \"managing\" GMPLS PCE?

We will use this model to investigate \u00a0  consistent guidelines for GMPLS path computation. fig 2.  \u00a0 The \u00a0  client Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection Virtual Concatenation is not a connection it's a mapping. 3.1.\u00a0 Requirements on Path Computation Request \u00a0 As for path computation in GMPLS-controlled networks as discussed in \u00a0 section 2, the PCE should consider the GMPLS TE attributes \u00a0 appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a path computation. \u00a0 Indeed, the path calculation request message from the PCC or the PCE \u00a0 must contain the information specifying appropriate attributes. \u00a0 According to [ RFC5440 ], [PCE-WSON-REQ] and to RSVP procedures like \u00a0 explicit label control(ELC),the additional attributes introduced are \u00a0 as follows: Starting an entirely new section with a subordinating conjunction is super painful it implies this is part of section 2  If this is just a subsection of section 2 then great it should be reorganized. Otherwise, consider: The PCE should consider the GMPLS TE attributes appropriately once a PCC or another PCE requests a Path computation in GMPLS-controlled networks as discussed in section 2. Appropriately really needs to be qualified as the the numbered elements below. remove Indeed 3.1 (4)\u00a0 if we are referring to the network\u00a0 technology in it's entirety is not G.709 OTUk not G.709 ODUk since the later is the wrapper for other client signals? 3.3  Mibs are not the sole manageability consideration associated with the application of PCE to GMPLS networks \u00a0 \u00a0  reliance on other protocols and functions are considerations (e.g. in or out of band signaling) are a considers \u00a0 \u00a0  impact on network operations are a consideration. 4.  imho the security considerations section is inadequate.\u00a0 at a minimum it should cite supporting PCE security considerations secretion of  RFC 4655",
