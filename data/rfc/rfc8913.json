I agree with Ben's comments about including more information about the privacy and security properties of specific entities in the module. See https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-security-guidelines  for specific guidance. Since this conflicts with normative language in  RFC 6087  \u00a73.4 (and 6087bis \u00a73.7), it is a blocking defect that needs to be remedied prior to publication.",
