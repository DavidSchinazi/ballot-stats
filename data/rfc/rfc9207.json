I have one DISCUSS point that has to do with IANA considerations, and is hopefully easy to resolve. Francesca 1. ----- FP: I am sure the Designated Expert will bring this up, but \"iss\" is already defined as a OAuth Parameter, for authorization requests. I don't think it's a good idea to use the same parameter name, although in a different message of the exchange, for something different, as the registration defined in Section 5.2 seems to imply. I strongly recommend to change the name in this document. Or, if we can agree that the meaning is similar enough to the original \"iss\", merge the two IANA registrations (this would not be my preferred choice).",
