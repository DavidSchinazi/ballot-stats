The root cause of the problem is that whilst the MPLS network sees all TRILL packets as data packets, TRILL surely distinguishes between IS-IS PDUs and data packets, thus the use of the term \"TRILL Data Packet\" in conjunction with the TRILL IS_IS PDU packets is confusing in the text below. May I suggest: OLD TRILL IS-IS PDUs critical to establishing and maintaining adjacency (Hello and MTU PDUs) SHOULD be sent with the Traffic Class that would be used for a priority 7 (maximum priority) TRILL Data packet while other TRILL IS-IS PDUs SHOULD be sent with the Traffic Class that would be used for a priority 6 TRILL Data packet.\u00a0  NEW TRILL IS-IS PDUs critical to establishing and maintaining adjacency (Hello and MTU PDUs) SHOULD be sent with the MPLS Traffic Class that would be used for a priority 7 (maximum priority), while other TRILL IS-IS PDUs SHOULD be  sent with the MPLS Traffic Class that would be used for a priority 6.
