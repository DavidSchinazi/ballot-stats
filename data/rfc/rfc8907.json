        "text": "Thanks to everyone who has worked on documenting the TACACS+ protocol as it is used today. I understand the desire to publish this document as a status other than Historic, as the protocol remains in use today. However, the shortcomings cited in the \"Security Considerations\" section are quite profound, and really bear highlighting in the document way before we get into what is fundamentally end material. I have serious misgivings about publishing this document as anything other than Historic without some prominent text early in the document (e.g., in the Introduction section) that warns implementors of the several caveats detailed in section 10 and its subsections. They don't need to be explained here, but some language along the lines of the following really needs to be present in order to scope the document: \u00a0  Note that the original TACACS+ implementations did not address all of the \u00a0  baseline security concerns which are considered when designing modern \u00a0  protocols.\u00a0 This document does not change this situation, and implementors \u00a0  should use caution when evaluating the suitability of TACACS+ for any given \u00a0  use.\u00a0 Please see section 10 for additional details. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a74.6: >\u00a0 To ensure interoperability of current deployments, the TACACS+ client >\u00a0 and server MUST handle user fields and those data fields used for >\u00a0 passwords as 8-bit octet strings.\u00a0 The deployment operator MUST >\u00a0 ensure that consistent character encoding is applied from the end >\u00a0 client to the server.\u00a0 The encoding SHOULD be UTF-8, and other >\u00a0 encodings outside printable US-ASCII SHOULD be deprecated. Without specification of preparation profiles for usernames and passwords, this is an incomplete specification of how to transmit non-ASCII usernames and passwords. While there are other solutions, the easy way to address this is to normatively reference  RFC 7613 , and select one of its username preparation profiles, and indicate its password preparation profile. The most basic problem here is that I might create a username and/or password on a machine that uses one mapping for a non-ASCII character, and later try to log in on a machine that uses a different, but semantically equivalent, mapping for that same character. This is a clear interop issue.",

Please define the semantics of these values. (2) Stewart also noted the following: \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_ASCII := 0x01 \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_PAP := 0x02 \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_CHAP := 0x03 \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_ARAP := 0x04 (deprecated) \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAP := 0x05 \u00a0 \u00a0  TAC_PLUS_AUTHEN_TYPE_MSCHAPV2 := 0x06 SB> There are lots of lists similar to the above.

But it also contemplates the prospect of new implementations. If new implementations are actually expected (which I was surprised about, but can believe), I agree with Stewart that each of the field values need a definition that explains its semantic. If new implementations are not expected, then the reference to new implementations should be removed. (3) How is \"secure deployment\" defined? Since this is used as a restriction in several places, I think it needs to be defined precisely.",

I also need to add to Alexey\u2019s DISCUSS on 4.6, Text Encoding: \u00a0  To ensure interoperability of current deployments, the TACACS+ client \u00a0  and server MUST handle user fields and those data fields used for \u00a0  passwords as 8-bit octet strings.\u00a0 The deployment operator MUST \u00a0  ensure that consistent character encoding is applied from the end \u00a0 client to the server. This is a mine field.\u00a0 Treating passwords as raw octets without concern for encoding and normalization can cause authentication failures and can be used to attack systems where non-ASCII passwords are in use. Suppose I enter \u201ccr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u201d as my password. How that\u2019s represented in UTF-8 depends upon my input device, as there are at least two valid representations of each accented vowel.\u00a0 Without normalization/canonicalization, passwords entered on different input devices might not match, blocking my access.\u00a0 And we haven\u2019t touched on bidirectional issues (mixing, say, Hebrew and English characters). The precis framework has detailed explanations of how to deal with usernames and passwords \u2014 see  RFC 8265  (and, for the overall precis framework,  RFC 8264 ). \u00a0  The encoding SHOULD be UTF-8, and other \u00a0  encodings outside printable US-ASCII SHOULD be deprecated.\u201d This doesn\u2019t make sense with respect to how we use \u201cdeprecated\u201d.\u00a0 You need to say \u201care deprecated\u201d, meaning that we recommend against using them.\u00a0 There\u2019s no  BCP 14  \u201cSHOULD\u201d involved here.",
