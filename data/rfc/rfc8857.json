I have followed the discussion resulting from Robert's Gen-ART review (and will have comments about that in the \"COMMENTS section\", but I think I see an additional issue that hasn't been covered in that discussion. draft-ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis  (currently in the RFC Editors queue) defines some situations where TLS and client authentication are normatively required. Specifically, section 9 of that draft says that, if the signaling channel is authenticated and has confidentiality and integrity protection, the BFCP client MUST be authenticated. Section 14 additionally says that under those circumstances, BFCP is REQUIRED to use the mandated cryptographic algorithm. But bfcp-websocket only says that WSS and client authentication are RECOMMENDED. I think this could be fixed by requiring WSS, and the web-based client authentication techniques described in this draft whenever the signaling protocol is secured. The simplest way to describe that might be to say that BFCP-websocket must use at least as strong protections as the signaling channel.",
