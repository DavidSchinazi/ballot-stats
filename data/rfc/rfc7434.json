I think what you mean is that ISDN security isn't great so don't expect too much, and that'd be fine.\u00a0 However if what you mean is \"ISDN security isn't great, so there's no point in doing better for SIP\" then I'd disagree. I can't tell if you mean that latter thing though. (2) I expected to see some listing of known security and privacy issues with the ISDN services (or a reference to something on that).\u00a0 Without that, how can a SIP developer or deployer know the level of sensitivity of these headers? For example, can I only use the ISDN service or innocuous stuff or could e.g. banking PINs be included? Can you explain why its ok to not include any such discussion?",
