(1) I'm not sure why that makes sense (HTTP still requires reliable transport, no?), but  (2) more Discuss-worthy is that I'm not sure where the question of whether to include the Early Hinted header fields is addressed.  Probably related, but since I can't figure out the answer to (2), I'm confused about this, also - I'm assuming that the 200 response could have additional Links that weren't included in the 103 response, but I don't see that written down anywhere.  If this is an appeal to \"be liberal in what you accept\", that's an answer (and I'd clear if it is), but I wonder if it is helpful to the implementer to make this clearer than it was to me.",
