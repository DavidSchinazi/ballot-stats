There is an important distinction between \"administratively configured\" and \"automatically configured through an unauthenticated remote protocol;\" this introduction discusses the two as if they are equivalent, but of course they are not.\u00a0  I don't think you should use this text from  RFC 6724  to motivate this document.\u00a0  To illustrate the problem I\"m talking about, ask yourself this: do you think that the administrator of the Wifi hotspot you connect to in your local coffee shop ought to have administrative privileges on your laptop? I suggest changing the text to this: \u00a0  [ RFC6724 ] describes default algorithms for selecting an address when \u00a0  a node has multiple destination and/or source addresses to choose \u00a0  from by using an address selection policy.\u00a0 This specification \u00a0  defines a new DHCPv6 option for configuring the default policy table. You can clear this part of the discuss by convincing me that I am wrong to draw this distinction, or by accepting the proposed new text. I would appreciate it if you could confirm that you analyzed possible attacks that could be done by influencing the source address selection policy on one interface to draw traffic away from another interface, and concluded that no such attacks were possible.\u00a0 The issue I'm concerned about would be for example a DHCP-supplied configuration preventing a VPN from working properly, or capturing traffic intended for the VPN, or else a DHCP-supplied configuration drawing traffic from one interface to another. I sat down and thought about it for a bit tonight and the attacks that I thought of don't seem to be possible, so I'm assuming the answer to this question is \"yes, we thought about it, and no, there isn't an issue here.\"\u00a0  So you can clear this part of the discuss simply by saying that, if it is in fact the case.\u00a0  Otherwise, I'd appreciate it if you could think about it and report back, because you probably understand the problem space better than I do.",
