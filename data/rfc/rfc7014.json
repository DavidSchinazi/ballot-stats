I've got to say that even setting aside my general dislike of compliance requirements, it makes me very uneasy to have requirements for the purpose of addressing IPR issues. Can you explain a bit further?",

Would/should a flow selection algorithm that was counter to RFC 2804  and didn't have any e.g. network management functionality be approved by the experts? I think the answer ought be \"no\" so maybe that guidance to that effect could be added to 9.1.1. (2) section 10, I think you should add text (or a pointer to text elsewhere) that recognizes that exported flows can be sensitive for security or privacy reasons and need to be protected.
