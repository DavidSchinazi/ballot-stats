Various security claims are made about the HHIT down to specifying cryptographic algorithms and resistance to attacks.\u00a0 However, this document provides inconsistent and vague definitions for a HHIT.\u00a0 Surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t cite draft-ietf-drip-rid.\u00a0 It is difficult to assess these claims given the lack of information on a HHIT.\u00a0 I would have expected this architecture document to make high-level claims and leave the details to a standards-track document.\u00a0 A few places to source the HHTI definitions: -- Section 3 says \u2018\u2026 explains the use of Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) [ RFC7401 ] \u2026\u201d,  RFC7401  defines HIT but not HHIT. -- Section 3 also says \u2018Self-asserting in this usage means that, given the Host Identity (HI), the HHIT ORCHID construction and a signature of the registry on the HHIT \u2026\u201d, but as doesn\u2019t explain that connection -- A few places in the text suggest that HHIT, as the name suggest are hierarchical, and this hierarchy is key to ensuring security properties (e.g., Section 3.2. \u201cThe cryptographically-bound addition of the Hierarchy \u2026\u201d; Section 3.4 says \u201cTo provide this, each HHIT embeds plaintext information designating the hierarchy within which it is registered and a cryptographic hash of that information concatenated with the entity's public key, etc. provides examples of computing a HHIT by encoding a HHIT\u201d; and Section 4.2.1. \u201cThe HHIT hierarchy\u00a0 can provide the needed scalability and management structure\u201d).\u00a0 Where is that hierarchy explained in this document?   This is up to the WG, but IMO, the discussion about cryptographic properties would be better suited in the document providing the specifics ( draft-ietf-drip-rid ) and the top-level security properties cited by reference here.\u00a0  ** Verification process of claims/assertions. -- Section 3.2.\u00a0 Each Observer device SHOULD be \u00a0  provisioned either with public keys of the DRIP identifier root \u00a0  registries or certificates for subordinate registries. -- Section 3.2 ... prepopulating small caches on Observer devices with Registry public \u00a0  keys and a chain of Attestations or Certificates (tracing a path \u00a0  through the Registry tree).\u00a0  Where is the behavior ensuring a trust relationship between registries described?\u00a0 These are no chains certificates in the X.509 sense. Where is the link between the \u201cDRIP identifier root registries\u201d and the verification of UA traffic?\u00a0 Is that  draft-ietf-drip-auth ? -- Section 5. \u00a0  Optimization of different DRIP Authentication Messages\u00a0 allows an \u00a0  Observer, without Internet connection (offline) or with (online), to \u00a0  be able to validate a UAS DRIP ID in real-time.\u00a0 First is the sending \u00a0  of Broadcast Attestations (over DRIP Link Authentication Messages) \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-drip-auth ]\u00a0 containing the relevant registration of the UA's \u00a0  DRIP ID in the claimed Registry.\u00a0 Next is sending DRIP Wrapper \u00a0  Authentication Messages that sign over both static (e.g., above \u00a0  registration) and dynamically changing data (such as UA location \u00a0  data).\u00a0 Combining these two sets of information, an Observer can \u00a0  piece together a chain of trust and real-time evidence to make their \u00a0  determination of the UA's claims. How does the use of specific message work if the Observer is offline? As noted above, this is up to the WG, but IMO there is a level of detail here that distracts from the discussion of the architecture.\u00a0 It would be best covered by reference.  ** Section 9 \u00a0  Broadcast RID messages can contain Personally Identifiable \u00a0  Information (PII).\u00a0 A viable architecture for PII protection would be \u00a0  symmetric encryption of the PII using a session key known to the UAS \u00a0  and its USS ... Per \u201cA viable architecture ...\u201d, I\u2019m not sure how to read all the text after the first sentence given this phrasing.\u00a0 Is the rest of the text the official \u201cDRIP architecture\u201d or an example? I\u2019m assuming the former and believe it would benefit from its own set of security considerations.\u00a0 A few initial questions: -- Are there channel security requirements between the decryption oracle/key escrow or distribution server/USS and the Observer? -- Is there a strong authentication/authorization model to gain services from the USS? -- How does this oracle or key server approach work in the case an offline observer?",
