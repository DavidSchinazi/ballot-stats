        "text": "A few super-boring inconsistencies that make the document unfit to  publish as-is but should be mostly trivial to resolve ((3) and (4) might be a little tedious but should be mechanical): (1) Section 3.3.1 says: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be silently dropped if not recognized.\u00a0 The code points for \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 experimental use are taken from the ranges previously called \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 'Vendor Private Use', the remainder of which now form part of 'RFC \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Required'. but I don't think this sentence matches what's proposed in Section 6.\u00a0 I am seeing the code points for experimental use coming out of the range that is currently described as \"specification required\", with the entirety of the range currently described as \"vendor private use\" being converted to FCFS. (2) Section 4.1 says: \u00a0  Mandatory and optional are used to indicate whether a response is \u00a0  needed if a TLV or sub-TLV is not understood on pages 14 and 15 in \u00a0  Section 3 of  RFC 8029 . but I think the text being modified is on pages 15 and 16 of  RFC 8029 (the page numbers are in the footer, not the header, of the plain text output format). (3) Section 6.2.3 describes changes to the procedures for the Sub-TLVs for TLV 6 sub-registry, but the changes described assume that the registration procedures are as described by  RFC 8029 .\u00a0 However, the registration procedures have already been changed by  RFC 8611 , so the changes described no longer make sense.\u00a0 (E.g., there is not currently a \"specification required\" procedure active for any range of this sub-registry.)\u00a0 We do, however, still need to make some changes to the registration procedures, specifically to convert the \"Private Use\" ranges to FCFS and carve out the \"Experimental Use\" blocks. (4) Table 22 (for Sub-TLVs for TLV 27 Assignments) seems to be a copy of Table 20 and does not reflect the current state of the sub-registry in question.",

        "text": "Hi, I have a couple of concerns regarding the change from part of the registry from \"Private Use\" to \"FCFS\": (1) Am I right in thinking that this could, at least in theory, break existing deployments?\u00a0 E.g., two separate implementations could both be using TLV value 31744 under \"private use\", whereas now they would both be expected to register that TLV with IANA under FCFS, and obviously only one of them would be able to get the registration?\u00a0 Are the authors/WG/ADs aware with high confidence that no such deployments exist? (2) I find the \"updates\" tag for RFCs to be somewhat ambiguous as to what it means.\u00a0 Specifically, is someone who implements  RFC 8611  obliged to also implement  draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registries-update  when this becomes an RFC?\u00a0 Or are they allowed to take the previous interpretation of the \"private use\" in the IANA registries?\u00a0 Probably too late to change this now, but I wonder if it would have been better to bis  RFC 8611  instead so that  RFC 8611  could have been formally obsoleted by  draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registries-update  instead. An alternative solution would be to keep the \"Private Use\" space as defined in  RFC 8611 , and allocate new space for FCFS (24 entries) from the 15,000 entry \"RFC Required\" section of the TLV Id space instead.\u00a0 These would seem to make the new allocation scheme in  draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registries-update  entirely backwards compatible with any existing deployments.\u00a0 Was this approach considered and dismissed for some reason?
