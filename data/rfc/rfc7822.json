I want to recommend its approval with a 'Yes' position shortly, but before that I had one question which I believe would benefit from some discussion: Section 7.5.1.2 says: \u00a0  If an NTP packet is received with two or more extension fields that \u00a0  require a MAC with different algorithms, the packet MUST be \u00a0  discarded. However, Section 7.5 already said earlier: \u00a0  If a host receives an \u00a0  extension field with an unknown Field Type, the host SHOULD ignore \u00a0  the extension field and MAY drop the packet altogether if policy \u00a0  requires it. This leaves me wondering how the MUST-drop-packet-with-fields-with-different-algs can be implemented. Did you perhaps mean: \u00a0  If an NTP packet is received with two or more extension fields that \u00a0  this receiver recognises and those fields require a MAC with \u00a0  different algorithms, the packet MUST be discarded. Or maybe something else? Can you clarify?",
