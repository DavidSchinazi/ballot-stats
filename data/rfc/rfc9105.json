        "text": "Thank you for the work on this document. This is a discuss DISCUSS - while reading this document and considering the normative downref to  RFC 8907  TACACS+, which is informational, I agree with Elliot [1] that to me this document would make more sense as informational. I have followed the mail thread and saw the authors' responses, which quoted  RFC 3967  : \u00a0  o\u00a0 A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 informational RFCs. I am not convinced that this is one of the cases that this bullet was supposed to cover. Additionally, I could not find in meeting minutes that this was ever discussed in the wg, as was suggested in the mail thread [2]. I'd like to know if the resp AD is aware of any related discussion after this point was raised. Another point the authors made in favor of keeping this std track was that they haven't seen any YANG data model published as informational. Again, I am not convinced that this is reason enough to progress this as std track. I note that this was reported in the shepherd write up [3] and in the last call [4], so won't block progress after a discussion, but I do think it is worth talking about. Please let me know if I missed anything.
