If not, why not?\u00a0 Saying \"When\u00a0 server MUST support TLS\" just seems broken and \"may not be needed\" also implies not MTI. I think a plain \"Servers MUST support TLS\" is what you want. Calling it SSL is ancient and wrong - 5246 does not specify SSL. 15.1.8 makes the same mistake saying \"TLS MUST be supported when \" which is just not clear. (2) 15.4.2 - I think the weak recommendation to send a shorter prefix (and adding in a random or zero low order set of address bits) would be better as a SHOULD that's done routinely, with e.g. the full /32 only sent exceptionally. What'd be wrong with that? (Maybe it'd be dumb for some reason, in which case you'll tell me, I'l be embarrassed and then I'll clear;-) That could apply to every address emitted by a client I guess - why not?
