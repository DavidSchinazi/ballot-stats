I fully endorse publication, and intend to ballot \"yes\" once we come to an agreement on the issue I describe below. The problem I'm running into is the URL synthesis rules described in section 3.1 for multi-tenancy engage in exactly the kind of behavior that  RFC 5785  was designed to head off: it creates URLs all over the path space of the authority, rather than coralling all synthesized URLs to live under only one top-level directory. One of the key aspects of the principles of the web architecture is URI opacity , which generally precludes clients from synthesizing URLs.  RFC 5785  was intended as a very limited carve-out to the principle of URI opacity, and was carefully limited to a single top-level path element. This specification oversteps that carve-out by exploding the location that \"Well-Known\" synthesized URLs can appear: it literally increases it from one location (the root) to infinite locations (at the end of any arbitrary path). Fortunately, this defect is trivial to fix. Rather than placing .well-known path components *after* the path identified by an issuer identifier, you place them *before* it, which amends this document's usage to be within the spirit intended by  RFC 5785 . For example, the example in section 3.1: \u00a0 \u00a0  GET /issuer1/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server HTTP/1.1 \u00a0 \u00a0  Host:  example.com Would instead become: \u00a0 \u00a0  GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/issuer1 HTTP/1.1 \u00a0 \u00a0  Host:  example.com",

If they are not, then you need to better define what \"case insensitive\" means. You've made a change in section 7.1, which looks good. However there is still the following text in 7.1.1: \u00a0  Metadata Name: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The name requested (e.g., \"issuer\").\u00a0 This name is case-sensitive. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Names may not match other registered names in a case-insensitive I suggest replacing \"in a case-insensitive manner\" with something like \"if when applying Unicode toLowerCase() to both, they compare equal\". Or maybe keep \"case-insensitive\" and just add a sentence explaining what it is. I think you should use toLowerCase(), as it is already recommended in other IETF specs, like  RFC 8265 . \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 manner unless the Designated Experts state that there is a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 compelling reason to allow an exception.",
