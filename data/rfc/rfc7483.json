This is a different point than the point made in Appendix A.1 (which should really be in Section 14 IMO) about the use of status values, which implies that the fields exist in the server-side database but are not shared in certain circumstances.",

        "text": "Thanks for your work on this draft and including options for privacy protections.\u00a0 I do support Alissa's discuss on the -sec draft and as such, my discuss here is specific to this draft and values set forth in it for privacy.\u00a0 The general security and privacy considerations would be good to reference from one place. I think it would help to have the explicit guidance or recommendations for privacy included directly in the privacy section.\u00a0 While the example in the appendix is good, I'd prefer to see explicit recommendations for each of the relevant status codes from section 10.2.2.\u00a0 How about something along the lines of the following: Current Privacy Considerations section: \u00a0  This specification suggests status values to denote contact and \u00a0  registrant information that has been marked as private and/or has \u00a0  been redacted or obscured.\u00a0 See Section 10.2.2 for the list of status \u00a0  values.\u00a0 See Appendix A.1 on guidance to apply those values to \u00a0  contacts and registrants. Suggested Privacy Considerations section: \u00a0  This specification suggests status values to denote contact and \u00a0  registrant information that has been marked as private and/or has \u00a0  been redacted or obscured.\u00a0 See Section 10.2.2 for the complete list of status \u00a0  values.\u00a0 A few of the status values indicate that there are privacy \u00a0  concerns associated with the object instance.\u00a0 For the following status \u00a0  codes, the RECOMMENDED actions include: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7. private - The object is not be shared in query responses, unless the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 user is authorized to view this information. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8. redacted - The data has already been redacted, and may be returned \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in a response in the data redacted form.\u00a0 This is a safer option to choose \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to prevent unauthorized access to associated object instances than marking \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 them as private. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9. obscured - The data has already been obscured, and may be returned in a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 response in the obscured form.\u00a0 This option may reveal privacy sensitive \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 information and should only be used when data sensitivity does not require \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 a more protective option like \"private\" or \"redacted\". \u00a0  See Appendix A.1 or an example applying those values to \u00a0  contacts and registrants.",
