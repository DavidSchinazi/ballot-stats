That section says that if the user agent is configured to reject public suffixes, then there is a case where a set-cookie request should be ignored. If the intent here is to normatively restrict the scope of Token Binding key pairs to eTLD+1 regardless of whether the user agent restricts cookies to that scope, that needs to be stated clearly. I kind of hate to say this but with the way this is phrased I also think you need a normative reference for the concept of \"effective top-level domain.\" (I suspect this would be considered a downref and may not already be in the downref registry, but I'm not one to make a fuss about that.)",

I think it's hard enough to understand that implementers will not interpret it in a consistent way. It's entirely possibly this is \"just me\", but I want to discuss it before progressing. I think this can be fixed easily with either some clarification text, or an argument that the issue is, in fact, \"just me\". In particular, the 2nd paragraph is pretty convoluted, but even after several readings the best I can get out of it is \"Servers that use token-binding with native clients should let them use token-binding\", which I suspect is not the (entire) point.\u00a0 Since these \"native applications\" are described as using HTTP, it's not obvious to me what is different for them. Additionally, I assumed \"native applications\"\u00a0 to mean non-browser, yet the third paragraph talks about \"such implementations\" but uses a browser-based example. Is there a different meaning intended?",
