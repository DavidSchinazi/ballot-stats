First, the examples throughout the document use organization identifiers like \"myreseller\" or \"myproxy\".\u00a0 This seems to me to be highly confusing, since these IDs are supposed to be server-unique values per organization, and are highly unlikely to be \"my\" reseller/proxy/etc. for all the entries in the registry.\u00a0 If I understand things correctly, the example IDs should instead be company-name-like values or \"random\" numbers or similar (or combination thereof). Second, I am unsure of the semantics relating to role types, especially as they interact with the\u00a0 command.\u00a0 Various aspects of the examples seem to imply that it is only permitted to have at most one organization mapping of a given role type (i.e., one reseller, one proxy, etc.).\u00a0 In particular, the\u00a0 element seems to be using the\u00a0 role attribute to determine which\u00a0 is being changed (with the new value being provided in the element body), and the\u00a0 element is providing\u00a0 with only the role attribute and no body to identify a specific organization to remove.\u00a0 If this reading of the document is correct, then I would expect the limitation to be called out more clearly, especially as it would seem to prevent a domain owner from (e.g.) using multiple DNS service operators.",
