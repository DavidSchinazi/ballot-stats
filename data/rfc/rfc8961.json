        "text": "If we are providing BCP-level requirements for time-based loss detection via absence of protocol-level acknowledgment, for new protocols, it seems appropriate to mandate that the acknowledgment signal is reliable, i.e., not spoofable by at least an off-path attacker, and ideally not spoofable by an on-path attacker either.\u00a0 I would love for this to be a cryptographically protected mechanism, but expect that I can't get away with mandating something that strong, and that something with \"enough bits of entropy\" will suffice.\u00a0 (I'd prefer \"enough\" to be 128 but could perhaps be persuaded that a lower value is appropriate as a minimum requirement.) Point S.3 in Section 3 indicates that \"[t]he requirements in this document apply only to endpoint-to- endpoint unicast communication. Reliable multicast (e.g., [ RFC5740 ]) protocols are explicitly outside the scope of this document.\"\u00a0 This limitation of scope should be reflected in the document's title, Abstract, and Introduction. I would also like to get an explicit confirmation that the various (non-)requirements on the details of exponential backoff and reduced weighting for old FT samples are as-intended (see COMMENT). Specifically, are there limitations on the base of the exponent for the exponential backoff, and is there a requirement to give more recent FT samples more precedence than older FT samples when computing an RTO estimate?",
