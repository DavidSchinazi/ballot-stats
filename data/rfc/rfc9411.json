        "text": "This document needs TSV and ART people to help with straightening out a lot of issues related to TCP, TLS, and H1/2/3. Large parts of the document don't correctly reflect the complex realities of what \"HTTP\" is these days (i.e., that we have H1 and H2 over either TCP or TLS, and H3 over only QUIC.) The document is also giving unnecessarily detailed behavioral descriptions of TCP and its parameters, while at the same time not being detailed enough about TLS, H2 and esp. QUIC/H3. It feels like this stared out as an H1/TCP document that was then incompletely extended to H2/H3. Section 4.3.1.1. , paragraph 2, discuss: >\u00a0 \u00a0 The TCP stack SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm at client and >\u00a0 \u00a0 server endpoints.\u00a0 The IPv4 and IPv6 Maximum Segment Size (MSS) >\u00a0 \u00a0 SHOULD be set to 1460 bytes and 1440 bytes respectively and a TX and >\u00a0 \u00a0 RX initial receive windows of 64 KByte.\u00a0 Client initial congestion >\u00a0 \u00a0 window SHOULD NOT exceed 10 times the MSS.\u00a0 Delayed ACKs are >\u00a0 \u00a0 permitted and the maximum client delayed ACK SHOULD NOT exceed 10 >\u00a0 \u00a0 times the MSS before a forced ACK.\u00a0 Up to three retries SHOULD be >\u00a0 \u00a0 allowed before a timeout event is declared.\u00a0 All traffic MUST set the >\u00a0 \u00a0 TCP PSH flag to high.\u00a0 The source port range SHOULD be in the range >\u00a0 \u00a0 of 1024 - 65535.\u00a0 Internal timeout SHOULD be dynamically scalable per >\u00a0 \u00a0  RFC 793 .\u00a0 The client SHOULD initiate and close TCP connections.\u00a0 The >\u00a0 \u00a0 TCP connection MUST be initiated via a TCP three-way handshake (SYN, >\u00a0 \u00a0 SYN/ACK, ACK), and it MUST be closed via either a TCP three-way close >\u00a0 \u00a0 (FIN, FIN/ACK, ACK), or a TCP four-way close (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK). There are a lot of requirements in here that are either no-ops (\"SHOULD use a congestion control algorithm\"), nonsensical (\"maximum client delayed ACK SHOULD NOT exceed 10 times the MSS\") or under the sole control of the stack.

This document does cite  BCP 14  directly, and then seems to take that curious pattern to the next level.\u00a0 Among the 130+ SHOULDs in here, I'm particularly confused by stuff like this in Section 4.3.1: \u00a0  This section specifies which parameters SHOULD be considered while \u00a0  configuring clients using test equipment.\u00a0  I have no idea what this means to the test.\u00a0 If I've simply thought about these parameters, have I met the burden here? This in Section 4.3.1.1 (\"TCP Stack Attributes\") seems an odd thing to have to stipulate: \u00a0 The client SHOULD initiate and close TCP connections. Then Section 7.1.3, which contains subsections about each of the test parameters for the benchmark described in Section 7.1, consists of this text: \u00a0  In this section, the benchmarking test specific parameters SHOULD be \u00a0  defined. As I read it, this is a self-referential SHOULD about this document!\u00a0 I'm very confused.\u00a0 This happens again in Section 7.2.3, 7.3.3, etc., up to 7.9.3, and even Appendix A.3.\u00a0 I think in each case you just want: \u00a0  This section defines test-specific parameters for this benchmark.",
