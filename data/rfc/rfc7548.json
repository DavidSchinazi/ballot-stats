In section 4.5, it is critical to also include a statement on security in addition to privacy.\u00a0 Medical devices with network attachments could be used to kill someone.\u00a0  http://abcnews.go.com/Health/dick-cheneys-fear-heart-device-hacks-justified-experts/story?id=20633284 Suggest changing this text from: \u00a0  In both cases, however, \u00a0  it is crucial to protect the privacy of the people to which medical \u00a0  devices are attached.\u00a0 Even though the data collected by a heart beat \u00a0  monitor might be protected, the pure fact that someone carries such a \u00a0  device may need protection.\u00a0 As such, certain medical appliances may \u00a0  not want to participate in discovery and self-configuration protocols \u00a0  in order to remain invisible. To: \u00a0  In both cases, however, \u00a0  it is crucial to protect the safety and privacy of the people to which medical \u00a0  devices are attached.\u00a0 Security precautions to protect access (authentication, encryption, integrity protections, etc.) to such devices may be critical to protecting the safety of the individual. Even though the data collected by a heart beat \u00a0  monitor might be protected, the pure fact that someone carries such a \u00a0  device may need protection.\u00a0 As such, certain medical appliances may \u00a0  not want to participate in discovery and self-configuration protocols \u00a0  in order to remain invisible. General statement: Many of the other use case scenarios also have safety as a concern, requiring security protections (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).\u00a0 Sensors used to control environmental settings is another example where air regulation might include detection of harmful things in the air (carbon monoxide).\u00a0 I'm sure there are other safety concerns that motivate security protections in each of the use cases, it's not just privacy (which is important).\u00a0 What if a sensor was tampered with to report or not report something detected?\u00a0 That's not covered in the discussion on availability related problems in 4.6, but does represent another set of security considerations that could lead to safety issues.\u00a0 More text on access control considerations for NMS may help.",
