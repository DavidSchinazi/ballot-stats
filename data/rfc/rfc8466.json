At a minimum, they need to be aligned (presumably to the formulation in 5.2.3, given the existence of permit-site and deny-site). But more generally, why does the model need to normatively require nodes to have a certain kind of access? As the Gen-ART reviewer pointed out, this doesn't seem necessary. And given that the cloud-access configuration requires the specification of a specific cloud-access identifier, what does it even mean that nodes should be authorized to access \"the\" cloud?",
