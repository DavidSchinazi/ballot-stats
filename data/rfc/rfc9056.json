I do see the response to Alvaro's ballot position but I'm still not sure that I understand what specifically requires this document to be on the standards-track. Yes, there are differences between IP-over-MPLS and IP-over-DetNet-MPLS, but (e.g.) how much of the DetNet-specific handling is just \"when you send the traffic onwards you need to ensure the quality of service\" which in this scenario means translating the DetNet IP needs into the DetNet MPLS configuration?\u00a0 In other words, a lot of this seems to be just giving information about how to fulfill the existing requirements from (e.g.)  draft-ietf-detnet-ip , so I am not sure that I understand what the truly new protocol pieces and/or requirements are.",
