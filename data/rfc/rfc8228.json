I have read the document, and, *as far as I understand it*, the technique / methodology in it seems reasonable and sane; however, the LC comments from John and Vint concern me, and I think that they really should be properly addressed - I'm hoping that there has been (possibly off-list) discussion regarding John's concerns? From my reading, the updates to the Introduction do not really address his issue.   The response to the IETF LC was primarily John's (and some support of his position). Unless my search foo failed, I have not found much discussion on prior versions - this makes me concerned that this will be used to justify that variants are safe without much review or consensus from those schooled in the art. I do not feel technically qualified to be hold a DISCUSS on the document, and so I'm balloting ABSTAIN - *I* do not see support for advancing the document in the IETF, but understand that others may differ.",
