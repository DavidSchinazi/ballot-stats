As Adrian also points out, you're doing things here that have to create new security considerations.\u00a0 In fact, in the very next paragraph after you say it doesn't, you say that this creates a new access control policy.\u00a0 Is there really nothing at all to consider with respect to Section 5? 3. In Section 4.4, can you give at least some guidance about what \"periodically\" might mean?\u00a0 You say that it's up to each service provider to determine, but how can they determine that without at least a few words about the considerations involved, the issues that might come up, the tradeoffs, the consequences of choosing a time period that's too short or too long?\u00a0 Could I decide that, say, 20 years might be a suitable lifetime?",
