[1] \u00a0  The DOTS client SHOULD use the certificate \u00a0  provided by a provisioning domain to authenticate itself to the DOTS \u00a0  server(s) provided by the same provisioning domain. This sentence suggests there is either another authentication method, or it allows for unauthenticated DOTS clients. If the latter, than I would expect a significant Security Considerations section on how to avoid/reduce malicious clients impact of such a setup. eg I could envision a compromised device from falsely reporting a DDOS attack from a certain network to block the compromised device/network from receiving traffic from certain remote networks.",
