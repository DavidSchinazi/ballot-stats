I think we should be a little more clear about whether the client can override the finalRecipient calculation (or just provide a suggestion to do so, or not give any input at all, etc.): the description of the finalRecipient property of an MDN object says that \"if set, it overrides the value that would be calculated by the server from the Identity\", which to me suggests that the client could set something to override the server (if the server sua sponte did something different that would typically be an \"exception\", not an \"override\"), but later on in Section 2.1 we say that \"[w]hen sending the MDN, the server is in charge of generating the \"originalRecipient\", \"finalRecipient\" and \"originalMessageId\" fields according to the [ RFC8098 ] specification.\u00a0 I do not see discussion in  RFC 8098  of client intput into the server's populating of this field, so I'm unsure whether/where the client has input.",
