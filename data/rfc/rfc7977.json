        "text": "Thanks for making TLS a MUST-use in section 10. However, that makes me wonder why it's ever ok to not use TLS on the other side of the MSRP relay. I assume that's  down to deployments that can't ensure TLS on both sides but that then raises some questions for me that I didn't see answered in the document, so I'd like to briefly check/chat-about those... (and also to ask if you can up the ante as well:-) (1) When both sides of the MSRP relay do want TLS, but the MSRP-relay-as-TLS-client fails to setup the \"righthand\" (referring to the draft's diagrams) TLS session, say because of a bad cert, what does the browser see? (That may be entirely obvious to someone who knows MSRP and need no change in the draft, but it wasn't clear to me.) (2) If the \"righthand\" MSRP session is not protected with TLS, then is that fully under the control of the client/browser? IOW, how does the browser/client express a desire that it really really wants TLS on both sides or else to fail?\u00a0 I think that's down to using msrps URIs but am not sure.\u00a0 Again that might be clear to anyone who knows MSRP but I don't:-) Can you clarify?  (3) The answer is probably \"no\" but would it be feasible to say that a client for this MUST only use msrps: URIs? If it were feasible, that'd be good I think. If it's not feaasible, that's a pity, but I'm not asking that you add pretend statements about security we won't get;-)",
