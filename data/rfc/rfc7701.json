        "text": "Thanks, this is a well-written and easy-to-read document. Just a couple  (well, three) of small issues that I would like to Discuss. --- Surpised that there are no requirements on authetication or control of admission to chat rooms. Was this topic discussed by the WG and left out on purpose (in which case we should add a note to that effect), was it forgotten (in which case we should address it), or is it not relevant for this type of chat (in which case you just need to explain it to me)? I would assume that the INVITE can be policed in some way. The best I  could find was in Section 5.2 \u00a0  Participants usually join the chat room by sending an INVITE request \u00a0  to the chat room URI.\u00a0 As long as the chat room policy allows, the \u00a0  INVITE request is accepted by the focus and the user is brought into \u00a0  the actual chat room. Indeed, there are several mentions of things being allowed according to chat-room policy, but no wider discussion of the full set of policy attributes, or how chat room policy is set. --- Section 6.1 \u00a0  On sending a regular message the sender MUST populate the To header \u00a0  of the Message/CPIM wrapper with the URI of the chat room.\u00a0 The \u00a0  sender SHOULD populate the From header of the Message/CPIM wrapper \u00a0  with a proper identifier by which the user is recognized in the chat \u00a0  room. I'm uncomfortable with the \"SHOULD\" here. It implies that you can think of a good reason why the sender MAY use some other (improper) identifier or no identifier at all. Can you either give an example (perhaps: \"The sender MAY set an arbitrary and meaningless value in order to hide its identitiy\"), or tighten the SHOULD to a MUST. --- Section 6.1 \u00a0  An MSRP \u00a0  switch that uses this fast forwarding procedure MUST temporarily \u00a0  store the Message-Id of the MSRP message to correlate the different \u00a0  chunks, as well as it MUST temporarily store the list of recipients \u00a0  to which the initial chunks were delivered. The motivaiton is clear. I think you could add that the storage can be released when the last chunk is seen. But what happens when the last chunk is not seen (or delayed)? How temporary is the storage, and how is it released? Or do we assume that because MSRP uses TCP (or similar) that loss will always be accompanied by connection failure and so that is the only trigger needed to abandon temporary storage?",

The current text assumes that this is an temporary issue, but what it is not temporarily? E.g., the particular interface is down? A link to any other place in the document describing the desired behavior would suffice . 2) Picking up this point below (also related to Wes' comments) \" In order to\u00a0 inform the user of the congestion, the MSRP switch can send a regular MSRP message indicating the user that some messages are discarded due to network congestion.\" In what direction do you send this message? Back to the originator of the message or down the congested path? Please clarify this in the text. Further: How can a piece of software learn from the chat messages (e.g., an error code or similar) that congestion is occurring?",

How is that mitigated? I think adding a sentence or reference to the security considerations would be enough here, e.g. saying that servers SHOULD implement some sanity checking in such cases. MSRP's security considerations say it can't be used as a DoS amplifier, but I guess this can based on the above.\u00a0 (This is similar to, but not the same as, Adrian's last discuss point.) In -17 I do see the pointer from p15 (was p13) to the  security considerations, but I don't see a warning about  DoS in section 11, here's a suggestion: \"A chat room is by its nature a potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) accellerator as it takes a message from one entity and sends that to many. Implementers of both UAs and switches need to carefully consider the set of anti-DoS measures that are appropriate for this application and switch  implementations in particular ought to include appropriate anti-DoS features. The details of what is appropriate will vary over time and will also depend on the specific needs of the implementation and so cannot be specified here.\" 3. cleared 4. Cleared.
