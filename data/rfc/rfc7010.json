For all of these protocols, the host or router id is the UDP message source IP address.

If the source IP address is changed (whether it matches the loopback is irrelevant), the syslogd, trapd, or IPFIX collector will consider that a new device appeared in the network. This is a problem. I don't want to say that the IP address mapping must be sent in band (i.e. in SNMP, syslog, or IPFIX), maybe updating DNS is sufficient, maybe querying a UUID is the solution, or maybe the solution depends on the protocol (sending the MAC or a UUID in IPFIX would help, as Options Template Record).
