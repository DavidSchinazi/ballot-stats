As others have pointed out, this document includes  rfc2119 -like language, both capitalized and not.\u00a0 I realize that  rfc1981  was published before  rfc2119  and that no expectation on the language existed then.\u00a0 However, we're at a point in time where not only  rfc2119  is in place, but  draft-leiba-rfc2119-update  (which clarifies that only uppercase language has special meaning) is in AUTH48.\u00a0 I think that this leads to the possibility that the average reader may interpret the requirements in this document in a way that it wasn't intended. While I would prefer that this document be consistent (and either use capitalized  rfc2119  language as intended, OR, not used it at all), I understand the intent of not changing some of the original text.\u00a0 I would be happy with a note like this one: \"Note:\u00a0 This document is an update to  RFC1981  that was published prior to  RFC2119  being published.\u00a0 Consequently while it does use \"should/must\" style language in upper and lower case, the document does not cite the  RFC2119  definitions.\u00a0 This update does not change that.\"\u00a0  [I borrowed this text from the the INTDIR review thread.

        "text": "I know this is a bis document and my discuss does not address any text that changed in the bis version but given all previous discussion, I would like to discuss the following text parts on statements regarding retransmissions which don't seem to be appropriate for this document and are partly even wrong. In general it does not make a lot of sense to talk about retransmission semantics in this document because this really depends on the upper layer protocol, and I'm really not sure if any implementaiton of a reliable transport does send retransmission based on the receptions of PTB messages (if exposed) rather than only relying on it's own loss detection mechanism. This discuss concerns a few sentence all over the document and most parts of section 5.4. Details proposals below: I propose to either remove this sentence, or at least reword to the following (or something similar): OLD: \"Retransmission should be done for only for those packets that are \u00a0  known to be dropped, as indicated by a Packet Too Big message.\" NEW: \"The IP layer may indicate loss to the upper layer protocol of those packets that are \u00a0  known to be dropped, as indicated by a Packet Too Big message.\" Or MAY or SHOULD or MUST...? Subsequently the following sentence should be removed as well: \"An upper layer must not retransmit data in response to an increase in \u00a0  the PMTU estimate, since this increase never comes in response to an \u00a0  indication of a dropped packet.\" And here is the bigger change in section 5.4: OLD \"When a Packet Too Big message is received, it implies that a packet \u00a0  was dropped by the node that sent the ICMPv6 message.\u00a0 It is \u00a0  sufficient to treat this in the same way as any other dropped \u00a0  segment, and will be recovered by normal retransmission methods.\u00a0 If \u00a0  the Path MTU Discovery process requires several steps to find the \u00a0  PMTU of the full path, this could delay the connection by many round- \u00a0  trip times. \u00a0  Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response \u00a0  to a notification that the Path MTU has changed, but only for the \u00a0  specific connection specified by the Packet Too Big message.\u00a0 The \u00a0  packet size used in the retransmission should be no larger than the \u00a0  new PMTU.\" NEW \"When a Packet Too Big message is received, it implies that a packet \u00a0  was dropped by the node that sent the ICMPv6 message.\u00a0 A reliable  \u00a0  upper layer protocol will detect the loss of this segment, and recover \u00a0  it by its normal retransmission methods.\u00a0 Depending on the loss  \u00a0  detection method that is used by the upper layer protocol, this  \u00a0  could delay the connection by many round-trip times. \u00a0  Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response \u00a0  to a notification that the Path MTU was decreased, but only for the \u00a0  specific connection specified by the Packet Too Big message.\u00a0 The \u00a0  packet size used in the retransmission should be no larger than the \u00a0  new PMTU.\" I don't understand the following paragraph. Can this be removed? \"Note: A packetization layer must not retransmit in response to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 every Packet Too Big message, since a burst of several oversized \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 segments will give rise to several such messages and hence several \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 retransmissions of the same data.\u00a0 If the new estimated PMTU is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 still wrong, the process repeats, and there is an exponential \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 growth in the number of superfluous segments sent.\" The following text is fine but probably is not needed if the whole document is reworded accordingly to ensure that retransmissions are solely the responsibility of the upper layer protocol:  \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Retransmissions can increase network load in response to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 congestion, worsening that congestion.\u00a0 Any packetization layer \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that uses retransmission is responsible for congestion control of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 its retransmissions.\u00a0 See [ RFC8085 ] for more information.\" This can also be removed, because a reliable protocol that detected loss and decided to send a retransmission, should and will do the same processing as for all other retransmissions, e.g. reset the retransmission time in TCP. Mentioning this separately is rather confusing. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"This means that the TCP layer must be able to recognize when a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Packet Too Big notification actually decreases the PMTU that it \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 has already used to send a packet on the given connection, and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 should ignore any other notifications.\" And this is even incorrect. Slow start means that you will increase the connection window exponentially. Only sending one segment means setting the congestion/sending window to one. I propose the following change: OLD \u00a0  \"Many TCP implementations incorporate \"congestion avoidance\" and \u00a0  \"slow-start\" algorithms to improve performance [CONG].\u00a0 Unlike a \u00a0  retransmission caused by a TCP retransmission timeout, a \u00a0  retransmission caused by a Packet Too Big message should not change \u00a0  the congestion window.\u00a0 It should, however, trigger the slow-start \u00a0  mechanism (i.e., only one segment should be retransmitted until \u00a0  acknowledgements begin to arrive again).\" NEW \"A loss caused by a PMTU probe indicated by the reception of a Packet Too Big message MUST NOT be considered as a congestion notification and hence the congestion window may not change.\" And I also don't understand this sentence: \"TCP performance can be reduced if the sender's maximum window size is \u00a0  not an exact multiple of the segment size in use (this is not the \u00a0  congestion window size).\"",
