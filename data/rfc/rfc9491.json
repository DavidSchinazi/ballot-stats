        "text": "Thanks for this clean, easy-to-review document.  I do have one point I'd like to flag. I'm making this a DISCUSS to ensure the IESG has a chance to discuss the point raised, and intend to clear after the telechat.  In his review ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-spring-nsh-sr-11-rtgdir-lc-bryant-2022-05-28/ ) Stewart Bryant makes a good point: ``` There is one point that the IESG should ponder. The authors have asked for a IP type assignment. This is a limited registry that needs to last the lifetime of the IP protocol suite. NSH started its life 9 years ago and has been a standard for 4 years and in all this time has not needed such as allocation. Neither SRv6 nor NSH are petite or lightweight protocols. So I wonder if the identification of NSH should happen at the IP layer as proposed, or whether an intermediate multiplexing layer such as UDP should be used? The extra processing for UDP is one test and the extra MTU is 8 octets. The decision for the IESG is whether in their view the extent of deployment and the gain in performance is such that they should authorise the allocation of the IP type. ``` AFAICT the argument against using a UDP encap is \"it's more overhead\" (which is true, but I think Stewart's point is that the UDP overhead is pretty small as a fraction of the SRv6 and NSH overheads). Anyway, it seems like it would be good to at least consider this question.",
