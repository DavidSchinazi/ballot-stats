        "text": "Thanks to everyone who has worked on this over the past several years. I have one \"discuss DISCUSS\" that I suspect may be a misunderstanding on my part about how Kerberos deals with OIDs in general. If so, please bear with my ignorance.\u00a0 I just want to make sure something important isn't being overlooked. I can see in https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-numbers.xml#smi-numbers-26 that the OID 1.3.6.1.5.2 has been reserved for Kerberos v5 objects (a reservation that appears to have been copied out of  RFC 1700 ). I also see that RFC 4556  uses 1.3.6.1.5.2.3 and defines three nodes (.1, .2, and .3) underneath it. Try as I might, I can't find any plausibly authoritative registry that tracks the reservation of 1.3.6.1.5.2.3, or of its children 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.1, 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.2, and 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.3. This document then defines the use of 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6. How do we know that \"6\" is free? How will future specifications know that \"6\" is no longer available? This document also defines 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.1, 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.2, 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.3, and 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.4 for the various hash algorithms. Assuming this list continues to be added to, how will future specifications avoid collisions? I have a similar question about 1.3.6.1.5.2.4.5.1. I think my confusion stems from the fact that I was under the impression that everything under 1.3.6.1 was managed by IANA -- at least, that's my reading of RFC 1155 . To be clear: if I understand the situation correctly, I recognize that there may be a bigger problem here that is beyond the remit of this document to solve; however, I think it would be reasonable to not make the existing problem worse. In particular -- and again, I may simply be confused here -- I would expect this document to at least ask IANA to create a table at https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-numbers.xhtml  that keeps track of the children of 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.6.",
