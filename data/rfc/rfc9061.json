The ASN.1 GeneralName type is an abstract type; in order to represent it in a string we must have some discussion of how it is encoded.\u00a0 (A similar concern might apply to the other ASN.1 types used, such as DistinguishedName, though the latter does have a fairly well-established string presentation form, so the concern is of lesser magnitude there. That said,  RFC 5280  is not a suitable reference for the DistinguishedName string presentation form.) In a similar vein, the 'id-key' identity representation is listed as type 'string' but the description lists it as an \"opaque octet string\". YANG strings are not directly suitable for holding binary content (which is what an opaque octet string is), so either a scheme for encoding arbitrary binary content as a string is needed, the YANG 'binary' type should be used, or this node needs to be documented as only allowing valid Unicode (IIUC, in UTF-8 encoding, though https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020#section-9.4  is not as clear about this as I would like). The two 'anti-replay-window' leafs are (1) using different-width types, and (2) do not have enough of a description to indicate what content they hold, especially whe combined with a default value of 32.

This as the outer IP header on sender side needs to set ECN field to ECT to enable so that any CE marks can be received. I think it is reasonable to have an option to just enable ECN, but that requires several things. Secondly with the changes in  RFC 8311 , there might be need to be more explicit in the configuration of ECN to actually indicate which ECT value that should be set on send side for the established IPsec tunnel. Due to under discussion experiments with ECT values per  RFC 8311  we should verify that just copying the inner header value to the external is fine and don't break anything as path and/or marking behavior may not be the same.  I think there is also the question if  RFC 6040  needs to be referenced in this context to ensure that people pick up on that  RFC 6040  updates  RFC 4301 .",
