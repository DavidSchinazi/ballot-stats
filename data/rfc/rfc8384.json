Row 3 in the diagram says 2 bytes or 4 bytes, but the number of bits called out in bullets 4 and 5 below it don't seem to add up to those things. Maybe it would be better to draw a diagram with F=0 and a separate diagram with F=1. Please make it clear both in the diagram and in the text what the expected lengths of the fields are -- I find it particularly confusing that the number of bits pictured doesn't align with the number of bits specified in the text per field.",

        "text": "This document feels tightly coupled with  draft-ietf-trill-directory-assisted-encap , even though there are no cross-references.\u00a0 If I understand the mechanisms correctly, a Smart Endnode (discussed in this draft) can then do directory assisted encapsulation (described in  draft-ietf-trill-directory-assisted-encap ).\u00a0 In fact, the encapsulation/decapsulation seems to be the main motivation in defining a Smart Endnode. I think then that this document also falls short in the exploration of potential issues, so I am also balloting DISCUSS.\u00a0 The same cases that I pointed at for  draft-ietf-trill-directory-assisted-encap  [1] are applicable here -- with the added caveat that the Smart Endnode, in general, has other sources of information (learning, etc.), which means that there are potentially more doors to close. The Multi-homing Scenario (Section 6) adds some complexity to the ability to check whether the Ingress RBridge is set correctly in the encapsulation.\u00a0 It would be nice to explore this case a little further and highlight the issues as the topologies get more complex. As I wrote in [1], I don't think that there are easy mitigations for these issues, but at least mentioning them so that operators are aware of the risk would be enough to clear this DISCUSS.\u00a0 Given that the authors partially overlap, it may be a good idea to solve the issue in this document (which is the general case) and then just have the other one point this way.

My understanding is that TRILL is kind of wishy-washy on MAC spoofing in general, but if you *do* have some sort of MAC enforcement in place but you don't enforce here, then this obviously bypasses that. Similar comments apply to the SmartHello filtering, I think. \u00a0  Smart-Hellos can be secured by using Authentication TLVs based on \u00a0  [ RFC5310 ]. \u00a0   I concur with Ben that you should explain the consequences of doing this or not.",
