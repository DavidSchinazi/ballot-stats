        "text": "The draft is well written and easy to read, thank you for that. I just have one concerns I'd like to chat about: Section 3.1, second to last paragraph This discusses the probes nicely in terms of privacy concerns, but leaves out the security concerns that have resulted in any type of probe traffic being blocked in the past.\u00a0 If you are going to leave the privacy concerns in this section, you should also have the security concerns with network mapping and the ability to use this information to assess open ports as well as path information that could be used in the first case to attack/compromise a host or for denial of service attacks for the first and second case.\u00a0 Path information is mentioned in 3.3, so perhaps the DoS mention would be better there and the general security along with the privacy in section 3.1. Later section 5 mentioned the use of an app to gather information from the end user as opposed to their gateway.\u00a0 Security and privacy considerations should be mentioned here as well since they differ from the the probe scenario.\u00a0 I would not recommend going in depth on this topic as this is just the use case document, but rather mentioning it.\u00a0 It would be out-of-scope to get to deep into application security and protections from compromise or the ability to gather privacy information about the user patterns.\u00a0 A high level statement of those concerns is enough (IMO) and can get addressed in the solution documents.\u00a0 Apps and desktop tools can be directly associated with a user as opposed to a home and can lead to desktop compromise, so this is different than the previously mentioned privacy concerns in section 3.\u00a0 I am aware that these types of services are available today via web pages and is up to the user to initiate. Section 7 First bullet I'd keep DoS attacks restricted to the degradation of service and have the points on privacy and business confidentiality listed separately as merging them confusing the points and attack vectors.\u00a0 Both can potentially use information gathered from the probes or the actual management station itself, but in different ways, this isn't clear from the bullet.\u00a0 The DoS could be launched directly from the management station or information about the network and path to hosts could be used to launch a targeted DoS attack.\u00a0 The accuracy of the measurement system mentioned in the last part of the bullet makes sense combined with the Dos Attack. For privacy, you could collect patterns of use to understand user behavior (already in bullet 2).\u00a0 Additionally, one could use the information gathered from probes to determine open ports and potential vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise the end point (security concern).\u00a0  For business confidentiality, I'm not sure what you mean here.\u00a0 Is this referring to an ability to gather endpoint information to monitor along paths for a business?\u00a0 I would assume that the probe traffic will be designed to include innocuous information and will just be used for measurement data. It looks as is the SecDir reviewer had similar concerns with the connections between points made in bullet one, so it would be good to fix this and I hope my above explanation is enough to help you adjust the text and add the additional considerations.\u00a0 I'm happy to help with the text if needed.\u00a0 The suggested text to the SecDir review is helpful, but would need to change to address the additional concerns I raised (thanks for your work on that with Hannes!). http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/ops/trac/wiki/mib-security The SecDir review had a few other good points for bullet 6 that you have addressed with proposed text and your proposed text is included here for tracking purposes: Part of Hannes' request:  * prevent unauthorized access to collected measurement data,  * give users the ability to view collected data,  * give users the ability to exert control over sharing, and  * enforce retention periods. ** Editor's proposed text on all points for bullet 6: 6. a measurement system that does not indicate who is responsible for the collection and processing of personal data and who is responsible for fulfilling the rights of users. The responsible party (often termed the \"data controller\") should, as good practice, consider issues such as defining:- the purpose for which the data is collected and used; how the data is stored, accessed, and processed; how long it is retained for; and how the end user can view, update, and even delete their personal data. If anonymised personal data is shared with a third party, the data controller should consider the possibility that the third party can de-anonymise it by combining it with other information.",

        "text": "In the end, I'm not going to stand in the way of this document if there is consensus on its content; it is just Informational. But on our agenda, we are specifically asked regarding Informational documents: \"Is this document a reasonable contribution to the area of Internet engineering which it covers?\" And I'd like to take a moment to DISCUSS that question. There's a significant amount of the discussion of the ISP Use Case that contains a lot of fluff about business and operational models that I think probably doesn't belong in an IETF document, though it's nothing out of hand. But I'm having some real trouble with some of the discussion on the Regulator Use Case. Some examples: 2.2 Regulator Use Case \u00a0  Regulators in jurisdictions around the world are responding to \u00a0  consumers' adoption of Internet access services for traditional \u00a0  telecommunications and media services by promoting competition among \u00a0  providers of electronic communications, to ensure that users derive \u00a0  maximum benefit in terms of choice, price, and quality. \u00a0  Competition is more effective with better information, so some \u00a0  regulators have developed large-scale measurement programs. For \u00a0  example, programs such as the U.S. Federal Communications \u00a0  Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America (MBA)... \u00a0   4.1 Promoting competition through transparency \u00a0  Competition plays a vital role in regulation of the electronic \u00a0  communications markets. For competition to successfully discipline \u00a0  operators' behavior in the interests of their customers, end users \u00a0  must be fully aware of the characteristics of the ISPs' access \u00a0  offers. In some jurisdictions regulators mandate that transparent \u00a0  information imade available about service offers. \u00a0   \u00a0  [...] 4.2 Promoting broadband deployment \u00a0  Governments sometimes set strategic goals for high-speed broadband \u00a0  penetration as an important component of the economic, cultural and \u00a0  social development of the society. To evaluate the effect of the \u00a0  stimulated growth over time, broadband Internet access take-up and \u00a0  penetration of high-speed access can be monitored through measurement \u00a0  campaigns. \u00a0  An example of such an initiative is the \"Digital Agenda for Europe\"... It seems completely inappropriate for an Internet *Engineering* Task Force Working Group to be making proclamations about economic competition and the merits (and no notable demerits!) thereof, talking about competitions's \"vital role in the regulation of electronic communications markets\", and touting programs for \"economic, cultural and social development of the society.\" I think it's a bit unseemly, and at some level (and certainly for folks from different cultures) potentially offensive. (And I haven't mentioned the whole net neutrality discussion that Alissa points out.) Is this really appropriate material for an IETF consensus document? I can see it as an IAB document, I can see it as an independent submission, but as an IETF WG document? I'd really like to hear other IESG members' opinions on this. As I said, in the end I won't stand in the way, but before I ABSTAIN, I'd like to hear what others think.",
