Would you use it for \"none\", \"fail\", \"neutral\", \"temperror\", \"permerror\", or more than one of those? The way it is worded, you could read it as saying this is only for the \"neutral\" case (i.e., the signature is there but not valid), but I could also see sending it back for \"none\". What was the intention? - X.7.21 says it's for the author not matching case, but I would think that this should be generalized for *any* of the  RFC 7001  \"policy\" cases. Do you really intend it only to be used for the particular policy case of no author match? If so, are we going to need other error codes later for other policy cases? Perhaps this could be cleared up with some specific discussion of the 2.6.1 cases in regard to the use of these codes. But as-is, I'm not sure they are going to be used interoperably without further explanation.",
