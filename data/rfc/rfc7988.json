This\u00a0 document is extremely hard to read and understand, and therefore comprehend if there are any implications to the information provided. I'm really not sure that this can be addressed here without a significant rewrite.\u00a0 (that might be because the topic itself is deep) A second is related to how the document positions itself. Its status is for Standards Track, yet in the introduction it says: In this document, we provide a clearer and more explicit conceptual \u00a0  model for IR P-tunnels, clarifying the relationship between an IR \u00a0  P-tunnel and the unicast tunnels that are used for data transmission \u00a0  along the IR P-tunnel. and  This document does not provide any new protocol elements, or any \u00a0  fundamentally new procedures; its purpose is to make explicit just \u00a0  how a router is to use the protocol elements and procedures of \u00a0  [ RFC6513 ] and [ RFC6514 ] to identify an IR P-tunnel, to join an IR \u00a0  P-tunnel, and to prune itself from an IR P-tunnel. Which to me screamed out informational,\u00a0 while then updating 6513 and 6514. However there are parts of the document that imply a semantic change in the use of fields or labels. Eg sect 10, use of timers when switching Upstream Multicast Hop.. so strongly suggesting a standards position. It feels like this document started out to do one thing, eg clarify the model of IR P-Tunnels and then acquired an extended set of tasks in dealing with MPLS label allocation policies. As I can't see a way to make a clear assessment of this document, I am taking an ABSTAIN position, and I will not block publication.",
