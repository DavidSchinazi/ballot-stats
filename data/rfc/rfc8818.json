Similarly, I didn't see any discussion of authorization for applying or making changes to the \"rules\" that are mentioned as needing to be applied by a data-plane node (as mentioned in the COMMENT where I ask for clarification on the nature of such rules). Also, we should reference RFCs 8221 and 8247 for the current guidance on IPsec and IKEv2 usage.",
