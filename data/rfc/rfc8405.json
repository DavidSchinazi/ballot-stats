        "text": "I am balloting DISCUSS because I believe that this document presents an incomplete and vague description of a specification, which (as is) won't result in consistent implementations.\u00a0 Consistency, through the specification of a standard algorithm is used as the basis to justify this work:\u00a0 \"To allow multi-vendor networks to have all routers delay their SPF computations for the same duration, this document specifies a standard algorithm.\"\u00a0  I am specifically and specially concerned about the fact that there are no defaults or even suggested values: \u00a0  This document does not propose default values for the parameters because \u00a0  these values are expected to be context dependent. Implementations are free  \u00a0  to propose their own default values. If the whole purpose of standardizing an algorithm is for different implementation to behave the same way and (specifically) \"to have all routers delay their SPF computations for the same duration\", then not defining defaults (and not being clear in the recommendations -- more on this below) makes the specification incomplete and vague! Section 6 tries to provide guidelines about defaults, but it falls short! \u00a0  In order to satisfy the goals stated in Section 2, operators are \u00a0  RECOMMENDED to configure delay intervals such that SPF_INITIAL_DELAY \u00a0  <= SPF_SHORT_DELAY and SPF_SHORT_DELAY <= SPF_LONG_DELAY. Why are the operators not REQUIRED to meet that relationship?\u00a0 Are there cases when it is ok not to follow those guidelines?\u00a0 Would (for example) the SPF_LONG_DELAY ever be less than SPF_INITIAL_DELAY? The other Normative Language in this section can't really be enforced, and provide (at best) very weak guidance.\u00a0  \u00a0  When setting (default) values, one SHOULD consider the customers and \u00a0  their application requirements, the computational power of the \u00a0  routers, the size of the network, and, in particular, the number of \u00a0  IP prefixes advertised in the IGP, the frequency and number of IGP \u00a0  events, the number of protocols reactions/computations triggered by \u00a0  IGP SPF (e.g., BGP, PCEP, Traffic Engineering CSPF, Fast ReRoute \u00a0  computations). \"SHOULD consider...\"\u00a0 How can this statement be Normatively enforced?\u00a0 Using \"SHOULD\" implies that it is ok to only partially consider the list you provided, or even a different set of criteria.\u00a0  Based on the suggestions above, I can't imagine how a vendor can set default values (even if \"free to propose their own\")...or how the average network operator could configure anything beyond the numbers that you mentioned as examples in the text.\u00a0 For example, the average network operator might ask: under the same circumstances, should my bigger routers (ones with presumably more computational power) have lower or higher delays with respect to my smaller routers?\u00a0 ... \u00a0  Note that some or all of these factors may change over the life of \u00a0  the network.\u00a0 In case of doubt, it's RECOMMENDED to play it safe and \u00a0  start with safe, i.e., longer timers. How can \"playing it safe\" be Normatively enforced? \u00a0  For the standard algorithm to be effective in mitigating micro-loops, \u00a0  it is RECOMMENDED that all routers in the IGP domain, or at least all \u00a0  the routers in the same area/level, have exactly the same configured \u00a0  values. [A similar statement is made in Section 7.] If it is so important, why is consistency not mandatory?\u00a0 IOW, why is it only \"RECOMMENDED\" and not \"REQUIRED\"?\u00a0 When is it ok to not do it? Back to the point of this DISCUSS, the importance of consistent values is clear!\u00a0 Based on the experience of existing implementations, please specify \"safe\" default values.",
