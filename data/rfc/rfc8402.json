        "text": "I ended up reading  draft-ietf-6man-segment-routing-header  in tandem with this document, and I have a question arising out of that. The trust model for SRv6 outlined in this document appears to be one of reliance on the fact that an SRH will only ever be inserted and appear within a single administrative domain. But Section 5.2.2 of  draft-ietf-6man-segment-routing-header  talks about an SRH being inserted by a device outside of the segment routing domain. Which is correct? I think this is an important question because the whole trust model for the SR information seems to rely on out-of-band trust between participating nodes. I also think this is important because there is no discussion in this document of the impact of the inclusion of the SR metadata on the fingerprinting of the device that inserted it. Section 5.1.4 of  draft-ietf-6man-segment-routing-header  sort of alludes to this but seems to equate the capabilities of an active attacker (who can conduct a traceroute) with a passive attacker who could passively collect topology/fingerprinting information simply by observing SRHes flowing by on the network. If the limitation to a single administrative domain is meant to prevent such a passive attack (not sure if that is really true, but perhaps the document assumes it?), that's another reason that the existence of such a limitation needs to be clarified.",

        "text": "While I understand the assumption that following the capabilities of existing protocols that incorporate similar functionality is okay, I'd like to walk through the security properties left off in the security considerations section to prevent tampering and see what can be done to correct that or minimally to list out the considerations. There's a few places in the security considerations section to call out specifically. Section 8.1: \u00a0  \"The received information is validated using \u00a0  existing control plane protocols providing authentication and \u00a0  security mechanisms.\u00a0 Segment Routing does not define any additional \u00a0  security mechanism in existing control plane protocols.\" For MPLS what \"security mechanisms\" are referred to in this text?\u00a0 It would be helpful to list any properties explicitly or drop this phrase if there are no additional security mechanisms.\u00a0 Since segment routing lists an explicit list of segments (I see that this can be done with MPLS labels and you note it is already exposed), why is there no mention of integrity protection and origin authentication to prevent tampering?\u00a0 I think EKR's comment is already hinting at this with his comments on IPv6, but I'd like to see explicit text to preferably fix this gap in the architecture, but minimally to document it and the associated security threats that result from this gap for MPLS and IPv6. Section 8.2: \u00a0  \"From a network protection standpoint, there is an assumed trust model \u00a0  such that any node adding an SRH to the packet is assumed to be \u00a0  allowed to do so.\u00a0 Therefore, by default, the explicit routing \u00a0  information MUST NOT be leaked through the boundaries of the \u00a0  administered domain.\u00a0 Segment Routing extensions that have been \u00a0  defined in various protocols, leverage the security mechanisms of \u00a0  these protocols such as encryption, authentication, filtering, etc.\" This document focuses on the same threats as the MPLS use cases with no mention of tampering or mitigations.\u00a0 Text should be added to describe how origin authentication and integrity are provided in the source routing header for IPv6 with the associated threats or to describe this gap if a solution does not exist.\u00a0 I have not read the draft referred to at the start of this section, so I don't know if it addresses the concern or not.\u00a0 In any case, this document isn't complete without some text on tampering considerations within your trusted domain.
