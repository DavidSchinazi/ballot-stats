It seems reasonable for 2050bis to not even talk about how appeals work up to the level of appealing to IANA, but you could read 2050 in conjunction with 2860 as meaning that if IANA receive such an appeal, they might then ask the IESG (with a possible appeal later to the IAB). This document might therefore be read as getting rid of that bit of appeal process (if it ever existed) that involved the IESG & IAB. Is that correct? (I'm not sure and happy to be corrected if I'm reading it wrong.) If so, was that discussed during the IETF LC? (I looked and didn't see it.) If the appeal path I postulate here was real, then it would appear that the sentence in the abstract that 2050bis doesn't change anything isn't quite right. Or perhaps that 2050 section 6 appeal process was already changed by 2860 or ICANN by-laws or something else later on?",
