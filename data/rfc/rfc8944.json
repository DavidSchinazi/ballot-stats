I also feel that the YANG model could benefit from another editorial pass:  - In many places the descriptions are very terse, and references are missing.  - The way that auto-neg is defined doesn't really match the 802.3 specification, probably splitting it into two separate leaves (one for whether auto-neg is on/off, and separate one for the duplex setting would be better).  - The use of terminology for VLAN vs QinQ might not be acceptable to IEEE.\u00a0 Finding names that are more closely aligned with the terms in 802.1Q may be helpful (although if I understand it correctly, 802.1Q bridges don't directly expose double VLAN tags).\u00a0 Possibly some of the terminology/description from  draft-ietf-netmod-sub-intf-vlan-model  (which has been reviewed by IEEE 802.1Q WG) may be helpful here.",
