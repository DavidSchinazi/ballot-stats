Please note that I am neither a YANG expert nor a segment routing one (hence my ABSTAIN rather than a DISCUSS).

The asymmetry does not look good to me... Are the authors/WG sure that the IPv6 YANG model can also be specified by augmenting this model ( draft-ietf-spring-srv6-yang-00  is still a -00 ...) and relying on types defined in ietf-segment-routing-common ? Especially when noting that the authors are different ? The YANG model for SR is really short (mostly meaning less except to add one tag in the namespace tree): \u00a0  \"module: ietf-segment-routing \u00a0 \u00a0  augment /rt:routing: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  +--rw segment-routing\" To be honest, I strongly dislike the fact that there is no common element between the YANG modules for MPLS and IPv6 data planes inside ietf-segment-routing. I admit that I am not an SR expert but I would have expected more common elements: policies, routing protocols, SID, bundlings, ... even if the leaves could be instantiated as generic types to be augmented later. One additional regret is that the document shepherd write-up is really really short. But it includes the most important element (to my eyes): the WG feedback & consensus. Regards, -\u00e9ric",
