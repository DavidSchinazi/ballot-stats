Section 3.2.1 says that clients send this option with the first query sent on a TCP connection and Section 3.2.2 says it should honor the timeout provided by the server and close the socket when appropriate. What is not discussed is how the client should manage the timer with respect to the reception of multiple query responses that may, or may not, include edns-tcp-keepalive option. Section 3.3.2 says the server MAY send the option, so it is up to the server to decide when to include the option and the corresponding timeout value. Should the client's timer simply reflect the value sent in the latest response? The smallest remaining time? I think a few sentences on client timer management would be beneficial.",

Most likely the answer will be the obvious one and we'll be done, but I want to check and if the answer is not the obvious one then holding the discuss as we fix stuff would be correct I think. The question: how does this option play with DNS over DTLS? [1]  The reason I ask is that there may be a need in that case for some similar option (or a TLS extension maybe) though for the DTLS session lifetime and not a TCP session lifetime. At present you are saying that this option is not it. And that's a fine answer but you could also have said that this could also be used for DTLS session lifetime handling. And that last might make sense for operational reasons (not sure really, but could be).\u00a0  \u00a0  [1]  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dprive-dnsodtls-03",
