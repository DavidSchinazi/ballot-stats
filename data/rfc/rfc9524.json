Yes,  RFC8402  says that SRv6 must run in a trusted domain - however, the practical methods of enforcing the trusted domain seem woefully lacking, and then, in addition to that when dealing with replication we then compound the issues created by potential packet injection. I simply cannot see how I can no-object to this, however, I also fully understand the criteria for discuss ballots, and since these issues stem from  RFC8402  I do not feel that I'm on solid ground balloting discuss.\u00a0 As such, I must abstain.",

I would like to this discuss text: \"Given the definition of the Replication segment in this document, an attacker subverting ingress filter above cannot take advantage of a stack of replication segments to perform amplification attacks nor link exhaustion attacks. Replication segment trees always terminate at a Leaf or Bud node resulting in a decapsulation.\" Here is issue with this - what happens post decapsulation.\u00a0 I.E - if I were to take an IPv4 packet - encapsulate it in a replication SID - with a source host I wished to attack, and a destination address of an attached broadcast - would the IPv4 packet be processed post de-cap. If the packets post de-cap do indeed get forwarded, the attack vector is still entirely real. The SRv6 is used to tunnel packets pass things like IP directed broadcast protections, unicast reverse path filtering etc, and the de-cap ensures they get acted on. If I've missed something here or am off in my analysis - apologies - but if not - the above text needs to be rectified so that this attack vector is made clear.",

This significantly increases and complicates the attack surface of the technology while at the same time introducing severe new misconfiguration possibilities (e.g., multicast amplification loops that can lead to congestion collapse of the network.) This document does not adequately describe and discuss these issues. Additionally, this documents needs to specify suitable countermeasures - it is not sufficient to leave this up to unspecified control plane mechanisms.",
