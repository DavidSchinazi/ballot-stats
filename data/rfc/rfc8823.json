        "text": "I have one point that I am not sure of the significance of and would like to discuss further, and one point that I think has a fairly clear/straightforward resolution. One of the key properties of ACME is that its authenticator provides assurance that both a party controlling the identifier to be certified and the ACME client jointly assent to the certification request of that identifier.\u00a0 I'm trying to explore a bit more the \"jointly assent\" part, and whether it is clear that all steps of the challenge/validation flow are ultimatetly tied to the same order request. In the validation flows for the challenge types from 8555, the full token is returned to the ACME client, which then provides the token to the entity that controls the identifier being certified, in order to set up state to expect a verification attempt using that token.\u00a0 In this email validation flow, though, the token-part1 is *only* present in the challenge email, so there is no thread of continuity that allows the email account holder to tie the validation attempt to the specific request (i.e., token).\u00a0 Any message that comes in claiming to be an ACME challenge would end up being treated as a validation attempt for the pending request, so the ACME server (or a party pretending to be one) does not have to provide any proof of knowledge of the pending validation before the response email is generated.\u00a0 Some key properties here seem to include: there is a portion (token-part2) to the response email that can only be provided by the ACME client, there is a part (token-part1) to the response email that can only be provided by an entity that can receive email at the email address being validated, and that the validation attempt, response email, and ACME order request can be tied together by unique identifiers.\u00a0 It seems that we could achieve all three of these by having the HTTPS response to the ACME client include a token-part0 as well as the token-part2, with token-part0 being used as the subject line of the challenge email and token-part1 being conveyed in some fashion (whether body or headers) of the challenge email.\u00a0 Does such a scheme provide any useful properties that are not provided by the current scheme? The more straightforward point is that the procedure in section 3 indicates that token-part2 is returned to the ACME client over HTTPS, but the stated procedure does not otherwise involve an ACME client in initiating the newOrder request.\u00a0 I think we need to clarify the interaction/relationship between end-user/email client UI/etc and the ACME client in step 1.\u00a0 In particular, I think that \"[t]his document doesn't prescribe how exactly S/MIME certificate issuance is initiated\" seems incompatible with requiring there to be an ACME client involved (and the presumed newOrder ACME request, etc.) unless the \"initiate\" operation is supposed to be the way by which the ACME client is triggered to start the request.",
