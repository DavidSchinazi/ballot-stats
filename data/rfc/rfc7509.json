Note that this metric MUST measure only primary \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 source RTP packets. I see the MUST above, and the RECOMMENDED below. \u00a0  Thus it is RECOMMENDED that this report block should be generated \u00a0  only for those source packets that have no further chance of being \u00a0  repaired and not for any other packets. This block needs to specify \u00a0  its own measurement period to avoid ambiguity in calculating the \u00a0  post-repair loss count. I was expecting a MUST instead of RECOMMENDED. Did the WG discuss that point?  In which situation would you need this exception, and what could you actually deduce if you apply it? 2. Question: \u00a0  The relationship \u00a0  between the metrics in this report block and the pre-repair loss \u00a0  metric of RTCP XR could be expressed in the following formula: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cumulative number of packets lost = post-repair loss count + \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 repaired loss count + to be repaired lost packet \u00a0  \"cumulative number of packets lost\" is the metric from RTCP SR/RR. \u00a0  \"post-repair loss count\" and \"repaired loss count\" are the metrics \u00a0  defined in this draft. Am I correct that it's difficult (if not impossible) to compare those values with a small granularity because: 1.  RFC 3550  section 6.4.1 SR: Sender Report RTCP Packet sends the \"cumulative number of packets lost\" with timestamps 2.  draft-ietf-xrblock-rtcp-xr-post-repair-loss-count  sends \"post-repair loss count\" and \"repaired loss count\" with sequence numbers. On top of that, the intervals are different!",

This goes against 2.
