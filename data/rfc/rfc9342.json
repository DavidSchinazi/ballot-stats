These recommendations are good, as they are the result of experimentation.\u00a0  However, they don't provide any deployment or operational guidelines of when  it is ok to follow them and when it isn't.\u00a0 For example, for the one flag case,  when it is ok to not measure packet loss as described in \u00a76?\u00a0 Why is the use  of that mechanism only recommended and not required? I have the same questions for all the recommendations and optional indications  in the text above.\u00a0 To clear this DISCUSS I expect deployment or operational  recommendations that can be used as implementation/deployment guidance.",
