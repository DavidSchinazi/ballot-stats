        "text": "Thank you for writing this document on this important issue. I want to recommend its approval as an RFC and will do so  shortly, but a Gen-ART review from Paul Kyzivat  inspired me to read the document, and I have  some comments. I'm not necessarily looking for  document changes, but I am looking for some responses  to Paul's or my comments, to make sure we all agree that we are doing this right. Specifically, > A detailed description of how these oscillations can occur > can be found in [ RFC3345 ]; the description of how a node would > locally detect such condition is outside the scope of this document. I am not an expert on this topic, but I'd like to understand the nature of such detection algorithms. How hard problem is that? What is required? I'm not looking for specifying or even referring to the algorithm here, but it would be beneficial at least for this reader to understand the nature of the class of solutions referred to here. Are solutions algorithmically computable? Heuristic? Dependent on specific configurations? Vendor solutions exist but aren't documented. > When the ADD-PATH Capability is also received from > the IBGP peer with the \"Send/Receive\" field set to 1 (receive > multiple paths) or 3 (send/receive multiple paths) for the same\u00a0 SAFI>, then the following procedures shall be followed: >  > If the peer is a route reflection client, the route reflector SHOULD > advertise to the peer the Group Best Paths (or the Available Paths) > received from its non-client IBGP peers.\u00a0 Depending on the > configuration, the route reflector MAY also advertise to the peer the > Group Best Paths (or the Available Paths) received from its clients. I am picking this text excerpt as an example. Like Paul, some of this language makes me slightly uncomfortable, and it would be good to understand what the aim is. If the intent is to describe a procedure that can be followed and fully specified, the expectations on the text are different from an informative description of the kinds of things an implementation could do. In the above text, there's quite a lot of imprecision. That may be fine, but I wanted to check that this is the case. For instance, why is a \"shall\" (and in lowercase) followed by a set of \"SHOULD\"s and \"MAY\"s? Is there any guidance on when the \"SHOULD\"s should be followed? There seems to be thinking behind, could that be documented? What kind of configuration issues affect the decisions?",
