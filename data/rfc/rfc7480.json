Also, I am confused by the claim in the second sentence. The message that I got from  draft-ietf-weirds-rdap-sec  and  draft-ietf-weirds-json-response  is that one of the motivations for using HTTP for RDAP was that its authentication features could be leveraged to provide tiered access to data on the server, such that some of the data would not be public but would be restricted to specific users (from  draft-ietf-weirds-json-response , Appendix A.1: \"In many use cases, it is necessary to hide or obscure the information of a registrant or contact due to policy or other operational matters.\"). So it seems like if cross-site requests are justified at all, there should be some text here explaining when that might be the case and when not.",

        "text": "Two small points, which shouldn't hold things up much: 1. Larry Masinter's AppsDir review notes an issue with using the HTTP 404 status code.\u00a0 404 is meant to say that the URL you're asking for doesn't exist (or the server isn't willing to disclose that it exists).\u00a0 The question is whether there's a useful distinction in RDAP between \"you're querying about something that doesn't exist\" and \"you're querying about something that exists, but there's no information available about it.\" \u00a0If not, then 404 might be OK (it's altering the sense of 404 a little, though). \u00a0If so, though, there should be different status codes, and 404 belongs to the former.\u00a0 Please discuss. 2. The registration of the application/rdap+json media type was removed in version -07, presumably to move it to the json-response document (which makes sense).\u00a0 But there are examples here in Appendix A that still use that media type, with no definition in sight.\u00a0 I'm not happy with that. I would be happy with an informative reference to the document where that media type is defined, and, of course, and update to that draft, including it (the latest posted version, json-response-04, predates this change).\u00a0 (An informative reference is OK, I think, because this is in an example.)",

On .well-known point raised by Stephen ....\u00a0 when EST came through the authors were told\u00a0 by the appsdir reviewer that: IETF standards should not define URIs or patterns of URIs, because servers may wish to provide other services (implying the possibility of collision), or deploy resources in an alternate way, for implementation or operational reasons.  This is a fundamental concept in the Web architecture; see .  Possible remedies include: 1) Specifying a \"home document\" format that links (in the  RFC5988  sense) to the various resources as appropriate.  2) Specifying a well-known URI to root the interaction. Note that this is suboptimal; while it avoids collisions, it does not allow alternate deployments, or multiple deployments on the same host. Why doesn't the same recommendation apply here?",
