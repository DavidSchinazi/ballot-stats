In case the router does not advertise support by including the value 'Link Identifiers' in the Extension Data Item inside the Session Initialization Message, I feel that the modem MUST NOT send the Link Identifier Length Data Item as this will result in a Session Termination message from the router based on the rules specified in Section 12.1 of  RFC8175  due to the unknown data item.  If you agree with my assessment, I would suggest a change like this. If not, can you please clarify. OLD: \u00a0  It MUST be used during Session Initialization, contained in a Session \u00a0  Initialization Response Message, if the specified length is not the \u00a0  default value of 4 octets. NEW: \u00a0  If the router advertised support by including the value 'Link Identifiers' in the  \u00a0  Extension Data Item inside the Session Initialization Message, this data item  \u00a0  MUST be used during Session Initialization, contained in a Session \u00a0  Initialization Response Message, if the specified length is not the \u00a0  default value of 4 octets. If not, this Data Item MUST NOT be sent.",
