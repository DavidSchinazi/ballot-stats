Please find below one blocking DISCUSS point (trivial to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education). I am also sympathetic to Ben Kaduk's DISCUSS point. Special thanks to Jasdip Singh for the shepherd's write-up including the section about the WG consensus. I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric -- Section 5.2 -- The end of this section uses \" https://example.net/rdaprir2/ip/2001:0db8:1000::/48 \" (not  RFC 5952  compatible with the leading zero in front of \"db8\") as an example but this example seems to contradict section 3.1.1 of  RFC 9082 .",
