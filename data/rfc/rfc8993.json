It does not imply any relationship between the two entiteis that trust the trust anchor. To be clear,\u00a0 I think that the authors do understand the actual trust and security situation here, and the rest of the subsection makes sense; I just think that this text needs to be changed to make the situation clear to the reader in an accurate way.",
