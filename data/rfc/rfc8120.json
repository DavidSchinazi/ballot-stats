        "text": "This is generally a well written document. I have a couple of important comments that I would like to see addressed and several less significant comments. 1) As Mirja pointed out, this spec needs need to register \"Mutual\" HTTP Authentication Schemes with IANA 2) In Section 7: \u00a0  If HTTP is used on a non-encrypted channel (TCP and SCTP, for \u00a0  example), the validation type MUST be \"host\".\u00a0 If HTTP/TLS [ RFC2818 ] \u00a0  (HTTPS) is used with a server certificate, the validation type MUST \u00a0  be \"tls-server-end-point\".\u00a0 If HTTP/TLS is used with an anonymous \u00a0  Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the validation type MUST be \"tls-unique\" \u00a0  (see the note below). \u00a0  Implementations supporting Mutual authentication over HTTPS SHOULD \u00a0  support the \"tls-server-end-point\" validation.\u00a0 Support for \u00a0  \"tls-unique\" validation is OPTIONAL for both servers and clients. I think the two paragraphs are in conflict. For example, the first one says that if TLS with server certificate is used, then \"tls-server-end-point\" MUST be supported. But the second says that it is SHOULD be supported. If the intent of the first paragraph is to say what should appear syntactically, while the second paragraph explains what kind of validation is actually required, I think this still can be made clearer. I suggest you either delete the second of these 2 paragraphs, or you need to reword text in the first (and possibly the second) to specify a non conflicting set of requirements.",
