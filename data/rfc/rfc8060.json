        "text": "Thanks for writing this doc. I plan to recommend its approval, but there were a couple of things that I think should be fixed for clarity before issuing the RFC. First, I agree with Peter Yee who did a Gen-ART review on this document: > Page 6, Rsvd2 definition: the definition both says \"reserved for future use\" > and then says some types actually use it.\u00a0 That sounds like present use. > And to generically say that it should be sent as zero and ignored, but then > to give uses (such as Type 2)\u00a0 for it\u00a0 is confusing.\u00a0 I suggest rethinking > the wording here. The type that seems to differ from the \"ignore\" advice in Section 3 is Type 14. Perhaps you can reword somehow, or name the Rsvd2 field to Flags, and let the Subsections define that as \"set to 0 and ignore on receipt\". Or something along those lines? I also agree with this comment and believe the text should be corrected: > Page 6, Length definition: there's mention of a \"Reserved\" field that's > included in the minimum length of 8 bytes that are not part of the length > value.\u00a0 Since there are actually Rsvd1 and Rsvd2 fields in the generic > version of the LCAF and sometimes even Rsvd3 and Rsvd4 fields when using > specific Types, it might be better to spell out which reserved fields (Rsvd1 > and Rsvd2) are meant here rather than giving the field a summary name that > doesn't actually appear in the format.\u00a0 This is also important because any > Rsvd3 and Rsvd4 fields are included in the Length field, so using a generic > \"Reserved\" description is ambiguous at best. And this seems like a bug as well: > Page 13, RTR RLOC Address definition, 4th sentence: The ability to determine > the number of RTRs encoded by looking at the value of the LCAF length > doesn't seem feasible.\u00a0 3 IPv4 RTR RLOCs will produce the same LCAF Length > as 1 IPv6 RTR RLOC.",
