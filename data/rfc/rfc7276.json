However, I find a number of errors of ommission that mean that the document may  result in confusion. You may be able to fix these by clarifying the scope of the document, or by adding text. --- I don't think your definition of OAM is tight enough to limit the discussion to only the mechanisms that you describe. You refer to OAM being scoped as: \u00a0  this document refers to OAM in \u00a0  the context of monitoring communication entities, e.g., nodes, paths, \u00a0  physical links, or logical links. And you define: \u00a0  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term \u00a0  that refers to a toolset that can be used for fault detection and \u00a0  localization, and for performance measurement. You also talk about  \u00a0  OAM mechanisms are used in various \u00a0  layers in the protocol stack, and are applied to a variety of \u00a0  different protocols. With these definitions: - a control plane module is possibly a communication entity - a node component (e.g., a CPU) is possibly a communication entity - a protocol keep-alive for an out-of-band protocol is possibly an OAM \u00a0 mechanism - a protocol keep-alive for an in-band protocol is definitely an OAM \u00a0 mechanism - LoS and LoL mechnisms in optical networks are OAM - Control plane error propagation and falt isolation mechanisms are OAM - Management plane tools and protocols are OAM (notwithstanding that  \u00a0 you say:  \u00a0  Other aspects associated with the \u00a0  OAM acronym, such as management, are outside the scope of this \u00a0  document. \u00a0 ...because management tools may be used for fault detection and \u00a0 localization, and for performance measurement. You appear to have limited yourself to monitoring layer-3 and below\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  forwarding plane components of packet/frame networks. Please take the time to scope this document more clearly. --- You should include a discussion of multicast ping and multicast traceroute ( draft-ietf-mboned-ssmping  and  draft-ietf-mboned-mtrace-v2 ) --- Section 4.2.1 You cite [MPLS-TP Ping BFD] as an example and give it as a reference, but this work has been retired by the MPLS working group, and the  relevant material moved to another document.",

        "text": "The following is an edited version of the comments received  from the Routing Directory Review.  Summary: There are significant concerns that need to be addressed  before publication.  The document does no needs to clearly identify the target  audience. Since a document written as a tutorial for a beginner  has different requirements from that written for a subject  matter expert this clarification is important in terms of  expectations in terms of depth and precision of the text. A  tutorial document for the beginner would be most welcome  considering the extent of OAM discussions that have taken  place in the IETF and it is assumed by the reviewer that  this is the intent of the document. To that end the document needs to -  Include\u00a0 a \u201cHistorical Background\u201d\u00a0 session that goes  beyond the single sentence in Section 1 (\u201cOAM was originally  used in the world of telephony, and has been adopted in packet  based networks\u201d) Provide a clear view of OAM functionality and its relationship  to various \u201cplanes\u201d of networking (data plane, control plane,  management plane). In particular, the importance of  fate-sharing of OAM and user traffic flows in packet networks  should be explained. Explicitly map the ideas,\u00a0 terms and methods that have been  adopted\u00a0 from technologies owned by ITU-T and/or IEEE to\u00a0  IETF-owned technologies.\u00a0 If such a mapping is not possible,  it should be explicitly stated. Explain in a neutral way points of contention regarding  various OAM-related issues. The draft as written is is a partial annotated list of  references to IETF and non-IETF protocols and mechanisms that  deal with certain aspects of OAM in IP, IP/MPLS, MPLS-TP  and Ethernet networks. The draft does not describe the underlying reasons for selecting particular protocols for description. It is not clear why the now obselete is ITU-T Y.1711 considered  in detail. The reviewer proposed giving consideration to I.610  as a protocol, although I am not sufficinetly familiar with  I.610 to determine its relevence. It should however be examined.  Similarly it may be useful to introduce the reader to E-LMI  (defined by MEF). In terms of MPLS-TP why is there no discussion of MPLS-TP  fault management OAM - ( draft-ietf-mpls-tp-fault-05 ) is omitted?? There are a number of readibility issues that arrise from the  terms and concepts taken from\u00a0 the referenced documents  having different meaning in these documents.\u00a0 E.g.,. in Section 4.1 the draft states that ICMP ping provides \u201cconnectivity  verification for Internet Protocol\u201d. However, in Section 3.2.4  the draft says that \u201cconnectivity verification function allows  an MP to check whether it is connected to a peer MP or not\u201d.  Since MPs are not mentioned with regard to ICMP, it is not  clear whether \u201cconnectivity verification\u201d means the same thing  in these two cases. In some cases the text is detailed beyond the needs of the  beginner, whilst other imporatnt concepts are not detailed  sufficiently for example: - The OWAMP TCP port information is not needed, whilst the IPPM    - In Section 3.2.3 the draft defines the term \u201cMaintenance  Entity\u201d (ME), whilst \u201cMaintenance Entity Group\u201d (MEG), a.k.a.  \u201cMaintenance Association (MA), is only defined by reference -\u00a0 In Section 4.5.2 the draft mentions security aspects of  IPPM protocols. Howeverwhilst, these aspects are not even  mentioned in Section 4.2. discussing BFD. The document therefore needs another pass to ensure  consistency of detail.   Major Issues:    The concepts of data plane, control plane and management  plane are not well explored in the draft and need to  expained with their OAM context. ======= The relationship between OAM functionality and network  management as presented in the draft is unclear.\u00a0  For example a. (Section 1) Other aspects associated with the OAM  acronym, such as management, are outside the scope of  this\u00a0 document\u00a0 <> b. (Section 4.6.4)\u00a0  The FDI function is used by  an LSR to report a defect to affected client layers,  allowing them to suppress alarms\u00a0 about this defect  << Alarms are arguable part of management >> c. (Section 4.7.2) When the ETH-CC function detects  a defect, it reports one of the following defect conditions: i. Loss of continuity (LOC): Occurs when at least when  no CCM messages have been received from a peer MEP during  a period of 3.5 times the configured transmission period  iii. Unexpected period: Occurs when the transmission  period field in the CCM does not match the expected  transmission period value\u00a0 << Since transmission period  field in ETH-CC is defined by management, this defect  reports a management issue> d. (Section 4.7.6)\u00a0  The Alarm Indication Signal  indicates that a MEG should suppress alarms about  a defect condition at a lower MEG level, i.e., since  a defect has occurred in a lower hierarchy in the  network, it should\u00a0  not be reported by the current node\u00a0  <> e. (Section 4.7.9)\u00a0  The Y.1731 standard defines the  frame format for Automatic Protection\u00a0  Switching  frames. The protection switching operations are defined  in\u00a0 other ITU-T standards. <> 3.\u00a0  OAM in connectionless vs. connection-oriented networks: a. (2a) above suggests that OAM is applicable only  to connection-oriented networks (if you do not have  connections, connection problems do not exist by definition) b. At\u00a0 the same time, the draft discusses ICMP Ping  (Section 4.1) operating in connectionless IP networks,  and Ethernet OAM (Sections\u00a0 4.7 and 4.8) operating  in connectionless Ethernet networks.  The authors should define the scope of OAM explicitly  and clearly - and then remove the sections dealing with  protocols and mechanisms that happen to be out of this  scope. In particular, explaining the relationship of  each specific defect to a specific networking plane.    MEs, MPs, MEPs and MIPs   Caveat: It may well be that the problem is not with the  draft but with the concept itself (or at least with the  attempts to extend it to IP, IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP networks) Consider the following statements:   1. (Section 3.2.2)\u00a0  A Maintenance Entity (ME)  is a point-to-point relationship between two Maintenance  Points (MP). The connectivity between these Maintenance  Points is managed and monitored by the OAM protocol.\u00a0  A pair of MPs engaged in an ME are connected by a Communication Link 2. (Section 3.2.3) A Maintenance Point (MP) is a  functional entity that is defined at a node in the  network, and either initiates or reacts to OAM messages.  A Maintenance End Point (MEP) is one of the end points of an ME,  and\u00a0 can initiate OAM messages and respond to them. A Maintenance  Intermediate Point (MIP) is an intermediate point between two MEPs,  that does not initiate OAM frames, but is able to respond to  OAM\u00a0 frames that are destined to it, and to forward others. 3. (Section 3.2.3)\u00a0 The 802.1ag defines a finer distinction  between Up MPs and Down MPs. An MP is a bridge  interface, that is monitored by an OAM protocol\u2026 4. (Section 4.1)\u00a0  ICMP provides a connectivity  verification function for the Internet Protocol\u2026 ICMP is  also used in Traceroute for path discovery. An OAM beginner would not be able to answer the following  questions: 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Can a communication link exist without any  MPs on it? 2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Suppose that I have defined a P2P bidirectional  communication link with two MEPs\u00a0 forming an ME.\u00a0 What  would happen to this ME if I add a MIP between the two MEPs? 3.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is the relationship (if any) between MEPs  and interfaces? Or is it just something specific to Ethernet bridges? 4.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Does a MIP really forward OAM frames that  are not destined to it?  5.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Operation of ICMP Ping does not require creation of  MPs. How does it provide a connectivity verification function for IP? The authors need to remove conflicting definitions, to fix typos  (e.g., the definition of ME would be less problematic if it referred  to a pair of MEPs and not to a pair of MPs) and inaccurate statements  (in IP, IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP MIPs (as a component) do NOT forward  OAM packets that are not destined to them \u2013 but they do  that in Ethernet OAM).   Minor Issues: Connectivity Check vs. Continuity Check  The draft mainly uses the term \u201cContinuity Check\u201d. However,  in some places the term \u201cConnectivity Check\u201d is used as well, e.g.: 1.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Section 4.12) A key element in some of the OAM standards  that are analyzed in this document is the continuity check. It is  thus important\u00a0 to present a more detailed comparison of the  connectivity check mechanisms defined in OAM standards. 2.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Section 4.3)\u00a0 LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping  operation (of data-plane connectivity and continuity check)\u2026 Please look at the use of the terms and ensure they are  applied consistently.   Caveat: Similar inconsistency in IEEE 802.1ag (but not in ITU-T Y.1731). Continuity Check vs. Connectivity Verification In Section 3.2.4. the draft refers to\u00a0  RFC 5860  as the ultimate  source of information about the difference between Continuity  Check and Connectivity Verification. Looking up  RFC 5860  (Section 2.2.3),  I\u2019ve learned that connectivity verification is a function that  allows an End Point to find out whether it is connected to a specific  End Point(s) by means of an expected PW, LSP or Section. At the same  time, the draft says (in the same Section 3.2.4) that \u201cA connectivity  verification function allows an MP to check whether it is connected  to a peer MP or not\u201d.\u00a0 The omitted\u00a0 words from  RFC 5860  \u201cby means of\u2026\u201d  make such a definition unclear; also it is unclear whether End Points  (of Section, LSP or PW) which, presumably, are MEPs, can be  extended to be MEPs or MIPs (the draft uses the term MPs). It is also not clear whether the draft considers LSP Ping (see  Section 4.3.) functionality \u201cto verify data-plane vs. control-plane  consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)\u201d\u00a0 as\u00a0 related to  Connectivity Verification. This is especially strange since the  draft also states (in the same section)\u00a0 that \u201cLSP Ping extends the  basic ICMP Ping operation\u201d\u00a0 while Section 4.1 states that \u201cICMP  provides a connectivity verification function for the Internet\u00a0  Protocol\u201d.\u00a0    Another problem is the statement (in Section 4.2.3) that \u201cBFD  Echo provides a connectivity verification function\u201d, especially  since  draft-ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi-05  in Section 3.5 expands  format of the BFD control packets in order to provide CV function,  while BFD Echo is not even mentioned in this document. It might be  worth noting that we are not considering BFD Echo mode for MPLS-TP. Finally, the draft does not explain whether there is any  correlation between the defects detected by the continuity  check and those detected by connectivity verification  (Section 4.10.3.1 looks\u00a0 a logical place for this).   Inaccurate Representation of IEEE 802.1ag In Section 3.2.3 of the draft theer is the following text: \u201cThe 802.1ag defines a finer distinction between Up MPs and Down  MPs. An MP is a bridge interface, that is monitored by an OAM  protocol either in the direction facing the network, or in the  direction\u00a0 \u00a0 facing the bridge. A Down MP is an MP that receives  OAM packets from,\u00a0 \u00a0 and transmits them to the direction of the  network. An Up MP receives OAM packets from, and transmits  them to the direction of the bridging entity\u201d.   However IEEE 802.1ag states (see Section 22.1.3 of that  document ) that: \u201cAll Up MEPs belonging to MAs that are attached  to specific VIDs are placed between the Frame filtering entity  (8.6.3) and the Port filtering entities (8.6.1, 8.6.2, and 8.6.4).  Separately for each VLAN, there can be from zero to eight Up  MEPs, ordered by increasing MD Level, from Frame filtering  towards Port filtering\u201d.   That seems to imply that 802.1ag MEPs are NOT bridge interfaces  (since there can be are multiple MEPs per VLAN and multiple  VLANs per bridge interface). Defects, Faults and Failures In Section 3.2.5 the draft discusses the terms Defect, Fault  and Failure. However, these terms seem to apply to the  \u201ccommunication link\u201d the term needs to be clarified to  indicate that this is a data plane entity, or the term data  plane used in its place. At the same time, \u201cUnexpected Period\u201d and \u201cUnexpected MEP\u201d  are mentioned as defects detected by ETH-CC in Section 4.7.2  even if, to the best of my understanding, these conditions  are side effects of mis-configuration i.e., a management plane problem.   VCCV: An OAM Mechanism or a Control Channel? In Section 4.4. the draft states that VCCV \u201cprovides  end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs\u201d.  This seems to point that VCCV is an OAM mechanism/protocol. However, later in the same section is states that \u201cThe  VCCV switching function provides a control channel associated  with each PW\u2026 and allows sending OAM packets in-band with PW data\u201d.\u00a0  And on the next line it explains that \u201cVCCV currently supports  the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping, and BFD\u201d  (which are all mentioned as OAM mechanisms providing  continuity check and/or connectivity verification in the draft).  So it remains completely unclear whether VCCV is an OAM  mechanism or just a channel for separating user data from OAM flows. The issue here may well be historic because VCCV predates  the modern ACH mechanism. This should be clarified in the text.   MEs, MEGs and MEG levels The draft explicitly defines a Maintenance Entity (ME) in  Section 3.2.2, but defers to MPLS-TP OAM Framework for  the definition of the Maintenance Entity Group (MEG). The  text defining ME in the draft differs from that in the  MPLS-T_ OAM Framework document\u00a0  (see  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework/?include_text=1 , Section 2.2).  At the same time, it resembles the definition of ME in  Section 3.1 of this document. MEG level is mentioned a couple of times in the draft,  but the only explanation given (in Section 4.7.2) is  \u201cThe MEG level is a 3-bit number that defines the level  of hierarchy of the MEG\u201d; and this seems to be the only  text in the draft that deals with MEG hierarchy. A more  details description should be provided. Differences between Approaches to Packet/Frame Loss Measurement  There is no description the fundamental difference  between two approaches to measuring packet loss \u2013  that of the IPPM WG (based on counting synthetic packets)  and that of Y.1731 (based on counting the user packets),  even if both are mentioned in the draft. MPLS-TP BTW  provides a tool for doing loss measurement and notes  that the instrumentation technique is independent of  the method of making the measuremnet.",
