        "text": "I found parts of this document hard to understand, but I'm not familiar with the specifics of the protocols. This discuss is in the vein of \"I think that folks might struggle to implement this correctly/consistently\".\u00a0  In particular I had some questions/concerns about section 5 which, if clarified, would probably help this document. In Section 5: \u00a0  The ASLA sub-TLV is an optional sub-TLV and can appear multiple times \u00a0  in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV and OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV.\u00a0 The ASLA \u00a0  sub-TLV MUST be used for advertisement of the link attributes listed \u00a0  at the end on this section if these are advertised inside OSPFv2 \u00a0  Extended Link TLV and OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV.\u00a0 It has the following \u00a0  format: I think that it would be useful to clarify when/why the ASLA sub-TLV can be included multiple times.\u00a0 I.e. when different applications want to control different link attributes. \u00a0  Standard Application Identifier Bits are defined/sent starting with \u00a0  Bit 0.\u00a0 Undefined bits which are transmitted MUST be transmitted as 0 \u00a0  and MUST be ignored on receipt.\u00a0 Bits that are not transmitted MUST \u00a0  be treated as if they are set to 0 on receipt.\u00a0 Bits that are not \u00a0  supported by an implementation MUST be ignored on receipt. It was not clear to me what it means if the SABM (or UDABM) fields are entirely empty.\u00a0 This paragraph states that they are treated as if they are 0, but sections 8 and 11 imply that if the field is omitted then it acts as if all applications are allowed.\u00a0 Section 12.2 implies that if the field is omitted then it is as if all applications are allowed unless there there is another ASLA with the given application bit set, in which case it is treated as being a 0 again.\u00a0 I think that this document would be helped if the specific behaviour was defined in section 5, retaining the justification/clarification in the subsequent sections. It is also not entirely clear to me exactly how the bits are encoded on the wire.\u00a0 My assumption is that if bit 0 is set, then this would sent the highest bit of the first byte.\u00a0 E.g. 0x80?\u00a0 Is that correct?\u00a0 If not, then I think that the document needs more text, if so, then an example of the encoding may still aid readability. \u00a0  User Defined Application Identifier Bits have no relationship to \u00a0  Standard Application Identifier Bits and are not managed by IANA or \u00a0  any other standards body.\u00a0 It is recommended that bits are used \u00a0  starting with Bit 0 so as to minimize the number of octets required \u00a0  to advertise all UDAs. Doesn't this need more constraints to ensure easy interop (i.e. bits default to 0).\u00a0 Otherwise, it would seem that anyone is allowed to put any value in this field that they like that could harm interop, or otherwise it might be tricky to compare a 4 byte UDABM to an 8 byte UDABM? \u00a0  This document defines the initial set of link attributes that MUST \u00a0  use the ASLA sub-TLV if advertised in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV or \u00a0  in the OSPFv3 Router-Link TLV.\u00a0 Documents which define new link \u00a0  attributes MUST state whether the new attributes support application \u00a0  specific values and as such MUST be advertised in an ASLA sub-TLV. \u00a0  The link attributes that MUST be advertised in ASLA sub-TLVs are: I think that I get what this means, but I find the last two sentences slightly jarring given than the ASLA TLV is optional.\u00a0 Perhaps predicate both of these constraints with \"(if supproted)\".\u00a0 E.g., something like,   Documents which define new link  attributes MUST state whether the new attributes support application  specific values and as such MUST be advertised in an ASLA sub-TLV (if supported).  The link attributes that MUST be advertised in ASLA sub-TLVs (if supported) are: Regards, Rob",
