        "text": "My understanding from the discussions surrounding  draft-ietf-6man-default-iids  was that  RFC 6282  constitutes an exception to the main recommendation (\"By default, nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes that embed the underlying link-layer address in the IID\") because the header compression scheme in  RFC 6282  requires that the IID be based on the link layer address. I see no text that justifies a similar requirement in this document. I think if this document is going to specify generating the IID from the device address as the only address generation scheme for link-local addresses, it needs to provide a justification for that. Otherwise, the default address generation scheme should be one that generates an opaque IID of limited lifetime. The possibility that the device address is generated randomly and refreshed on each power cycle is important to note, but is not by itself sufficient justification given what I assume is the wider deployment of static device addresses. If the v6 address can provide better privacy protection than the device address, it should. On that point, there also seems to be a discrepancy between Section 3.2.2 and Section 5. Section 3.2.2 states: \"(After a Bluetooth LE logical link has been established, it \u00a0  is referenced with a Connection Handle in HCI.\u00a0 Thus possibly \u00a0  changing device addresses do not impact data flows within existing \u00a0  L2CAP channels.\u00a0 Hence there is no need to change IPv6 link-local \u00a0  addresses even if devices change their random device addresses during \u00a0  L2CAP channel lifetime).\" \u00a0   Section 5 states: \"The IPv6 link-local address configuration described in Section 3.2.2 \u00a0  strictly binds the privacy level of IPv6 link-local address to the \u00a0  privacy level device has selected for the Bluetooth LE.\u00a0 This means \u00a0  that a device using Bluetooth privacy features will retain the same \u00a0  level of privacy with generated IPv6 link-local addresses.\" If the IID remains the same even when the device address changes, then the IID can be used to correlate activities of the device for the full lifetime of the IID, which goes beyond the lifetime of the device address. So the \"privacy level\" afforded by the device address is not the same as that of the IID. If this document is going to specify the generation of IIDs based on device addresses, why not regenerate the IID when the device address is regenerated?",
