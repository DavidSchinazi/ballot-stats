(2) The document seems incomplete to me.\u00a0 It has some aspects of being all/any of a use-cases document, an architecture document, and an applicability analysis, but does not seem to have a complete treatment for any of them.\u00a0 To be clear, there is enough in the document to indicate that the topic merits further work, and there are some interesting results, but I'm not sure that publication as an RFC is appropriate for this document in this form.\u00a0 Specifically: (2a) use-cases: we see the examples of star topology with BRAS/SR and the simulated network in Figure 6, but there is not much discussion of where these (or similar) scenarios arise in practice, how common they are, and how closely the simulation reflects actual usage. (2b) architecture: a very high-level picture is given (\"use a PCE to engineer some of the IP traffic on a network and improve overall efficiency\"), but we don't see much about how PCCs will be involved and apply the computed paths or what requirements will need to be met by the protocols and components used to instantiate the architecture (2c) applicability: we see some scenarios where the proposed technology shows drastic improvement over the alternative selected for comparison, but there is little to give confidence that this reflects a broad maxima that is robust to environmental variations.\u00a0 Is the alternative selected for comparison an appropriate one for the cases in question?\u00a0 How would the propsal react in the face of changes in the environment it runs in, such as link or node failure, changes in the baseline usage, or traffic spikes?\u00a0 What timescale can it react in and what level of visibility does the PCE need into current conditions in order to be reliable?",

The document in its current form appear to be outside of TEAS Charter. This document is none of the several things TEAS is approved to work with. As Benjamin enumerates so well the document is also a very poor support or architecture document. Which is why I would argue that it fully outside of the TEAS charter as neither a main objective of the WG or a support document.  Even if fixed to be a better support document, I still think the WG should consider its charter and the IESG statement on support documents:  https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/support-documents/  and ask themselves if that is really something that is worth publishing.",
