The document claims to cover \"circuit-switched\" cases, when in reality it is very PSTN-specific.\u00a0 Namely, in order to work, it needs the CS network to support CPNI, UUIE, or DTMF.\u00a0 Also, in order for \"c=\" lines to make sense, the CS network needs to support E.164 numbers for addresses.\u00a0 Please clarify that this addresses the use of the CS half of the PSTN (or at least CS networks that meet the above criteria), not a general CS network. D2. If we consider this document as focused on the PSTN, then it seems like the \"-\" addrtype should be removed, since all CS endpoints have an E.164 address.\u00a0 (And in any case, its use is illegal according to Section 5.6.) D3. The line \"m=audio 9 PSTN -\" can only work if the CS channel is actually an audio channel and not, say, a CS data channel. Likewise for video.\u00a0 So this line should only be included / accepted by the active party if the active party knows that it the CS channel it will establish will have the appropriate mechanisms.\u00a0 Please update 5.6.1 / 5.6.2 to require that this information about the CS layer be taken into account.",
