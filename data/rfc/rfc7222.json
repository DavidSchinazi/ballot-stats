So I would like to understand whether there has been any discussion about doing this within the IESG, and whether the IESG believes that it makes sense to proceed with this document given that it's arguably out of charter and also arguably out of scope for the IETF.\u00a0  I realize the latter point is debatable, but at the very least if this is in-scope, it ought to see more widespread discussion.\u00a0  Perhaps that decision already has IETF consensus and someone can point me to the relevant RFC, but normally I would expect to see that consensus reflected in the working group charter, and I don't see it there. The authors and/or document shepherd may wish to weigh in on this, but should not feel pressured to do so\u2014I think the bulk of this discussion will have to be an IESG discussion.",
