Section 5.2.7 Please make mention and reference to security provisions for SNMP and Syslog.\u00a0  RFC5424  is just for syslog, so a pointer for SNMP security considerations should be added in this section as well.\u00a0 They use a boilerplate for the text and add considerations specific to a draft.\u00a0  Benoit - do you have a good reference for them to use?\u00a0 A more generic SNMP draft might not be up-to-date with the latest boilerplate text.\u00a0 If that's the case, the recent changes are small and could be stated with a pointer to an RFC with the older boilerplate text. 2. Are there any considerations for the statistics collected, can they be used in a malicious way?\u00a0 I would think so and that this would be an important security consideration.\u00a0 Mentioning possible issues would be helpful to the reader. Section 6 Reference to  RFC2616  isn't enough for the security considerations of HTTP since that's a really old RFC.\u00a0 If you want authentication options, you could point to the HTTPAuth documents, which include updated versions of HTTP basic ( RFC7616 ) and digest ( RFC7617 ).\u00a0 While there are still lots of security issues with these options, the RFCs spell out what the actual considerations are, which are helpful to the reader.\u00a0 This raises the need for TLS 1.2 as well to provide session protection for the session (passive and active attacks) as well as for the authentication used. Section 6.1 Why isn't TLS a must here to protect the session data? If you are relying on OAuth Bearer tokens, they offer no security protection without TLS, so to rely on this, I'd say TLS really should be a MUST.\u00a0 The authentication types to get a bearer token (at least in RFC documentation and in the registry) are all pretty weak and require TLS protection to have any level of security. With the TLS MUST, we are recommending TLS 1.2 as the minimum in drafts.\u00a0 It would be good to see a mention of TLS 1.2 as a minimum recommendation and a reference to the BCP for TLS 1.2 configurations  RFC7525  (it even includes cipher suite recommendations). Privacy I would have expected some discussion on the protection of the 2 ID types and the tracker capabilities and that session encryption (TLS) ought to be used when this is a consideration.\u00a0 Is there a reason this isn't covered?\u00a0 If it's not a concern, I'd like to understand why.",
