Please find below some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education).  Special thanks to Susan Hares for the shepherd's write-up including the section about the WG consensus. While I am not aware of the history about the use of those \"experimental\" code points and while I am aware that changing the code points in running code is an impossible endeavour, I wonder how those code points were used in production networks (my guess) while keeping the status of 'experimental'. I.e., the code points 0x81 and 0x82 are noted as 'experimental' but  RFC 8955  is standard track. I am balloting ABSTAIN as I miss the history. ***Bottom line for IANA/IESG: what can we learn from this apparent \"mess\" (I am afraid that my limited English vocabulary is unable to find a more positive word)?*** Regards, -\u00e9ric In \"The primary use for those types and sub-type registries is non experimental\" should a \"now\" be inserted before the \"non\" ? I also wonder why \"0x80-0x82 | First Come First Served\" since this document confirms the allocation ? What am I missing here ?",

RFC7153  designated 0x80-0x8f as experimental and then immediately defines 0x80 as the gateway to a further subregistry of FCFS/IETF review codepoints. This does not appear to be \"Reserved for Experimental Use\" in the  RFC 3692  sense, in that it is not meant to be used only by explicit experiments. (It's a standards track document). 2.  RFC8955  compounds it by taking another 2 (of 15 remaining!) experimental codepoints in a standards-track document, for a similar purpose. I agree with this draft's reclassification of the 3 codepoints, as it recognizes reality that they are apparently no longer safe for  RFC 3692  experiments. But I would also like to verify that this behavior will not continue: future standards-track allocations, including those pointing to more subtypes (\"Part 4\", etc), will draw from the FCFS range, not Experimental. Furthermore, experiments (with a draft or not) that use one of these experimental codepoints should be reassigned a FCFS codepoint if they move to Standards track.",
