However, I am pretty sure that you have a number of references listed as  Informative when they should be Normative.\u00a0 Just a random example, RFC 3339  is cited in Section 2.4.1 as describing the date/time format for tag=0. That would appear to make  RFC 3339  a normative reference. I think you will find a number of similar examples. Even [ I-D.ietf-lwig-terminology ] seems to be used in a normative way in section 1.1 in that I cannot understand objective 2 without reading the definition of \"constrained node\" in that document.",

I'd like to hear some more about why PS is appropriate for this instead of Experimental. This was not the product of a chartered work item where people understood and came to consensus on what problem they were trying to solve and then came to consensus on the solution. Instead, some individuals had an idea about a problem to solve (which is not completely explicit), solved it, and asked for endorsement of the IETF. I'd like to think we'd reserve that tool for things that we know fill a well-known gap. Conversely, I'd like to see what this gets used for and how well it works, so having a section on \"how we're going to tell if this is getting good deployment\" (which I think should be in any Experimental document) seems like a good thing. What's the advantage at this point of declaring this an IETF Proposed Standard as against letting this run as an experiment for a while? I might understand that Barry thought this was important enough that it warranted IETF attention rather than simply ISE attention, but I'm still not clear on PS vs. Exp.",
