For example daniel_smith.home.arpa reveal the identity of the member of the homenet, my_ipad.home.arpa reveals the devices you own, the application.  home.arpa  may also used in larger environment such as corporate / private. going from one to the other may also leak such information.  The leak can be from the homenet to the outside world in which case one neeed to control the queries sent. But in intruder (or guest) may also access the homenet and proceed to discovery of the names.  As a result even though homenet is believe to be a trusted environment, care should be considered while publishing under the  home.arpa . as well as whose the information is accessible to.\u00a0   They might be collision as well.  myprinter.home.arpa  may be found in various environments, and upon discovery you may also - in this example - print confidential information to that printer.  In some case you may not even be aware, for example, if your printing information failed home, and is re-activated once you are in another environment.\u00a0  As information may be sensitive it may be encrypted using IPsec DTLS as described by dprive for both authentication and confidentiality.  When the trust anchor is configured in the resolver, these must be able to roll-over the key and should follows the requirements for DNSSEC validators. if it is impossible for a resolver to see the difference between an attack and a re-key we are in trouble.",

Unless I'm really confused, this means that I have to make myself authoritative for .arpa, which will a: break everything else in .arpa, and b: will (correctly!) be DNSSEC bogus to validating stubs. (See also #5). Perhaps you mean that there should be something like (BINDism): zone \" home.arpa \" { \ttype forward; \tforwarders { 192.0.2.1; 192.0.2.2; }; }; This possibility only came to me after much thought, and I do not think that it could be described as \"a delegation\". I also do not think that this is a standard / well defined behavior. 2: Section 4.\u00a0 Domain Name Reservation Considerations, Subsection 4 \"Caching resolvers conforming to this specification MUST support DNSSEC queries.\" This is a MUST, so it's important to understand, but I don't understand what it actually means.\u00a0 What is a \"DNSSEC query\"? It is just one with the DO bit? It is one looking for a DS / RRSIG / similar as the qtype? I don't know what this means, so I don't know if it applies to me / what I should do. 3: \"Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS proxies MUST behave as described in Locally Served Zones ([ RFC6303 ] Section 3).\u00a0 That is, queries for domains that are subdomains of \u2019 home.arpa .\u2019 MUST NOT be forwarded, with one important exception: ...\"  This says that I must not forward for *domains* that are *subdomains* of  home.arpa . The example shows a lookup for NS for ' home.arpa ', so presumably this is actually talking about subdomains of  home.arpa .\u00a0 So, I have no idea what to do for lookups within  home.arpa  itself -- what do I do with query for the A record for  printer.home.arpa?  It is simply a name within  home.arpa ; I have no way of knowing if it is a subdomain of  home.arpa  but it certainly isn't a domain that is a subdomain of  home.arpa  (because there are only three label, not four).",
