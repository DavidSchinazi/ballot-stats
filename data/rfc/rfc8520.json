Partially guided by some of the discussion that has already happened, it seems like there are three places where authentication/identity validation occurs in the MUD flow: the (CMS) signature alongside the MUD file, the TLS connection used to retrieve the MUD file, and the binding between the MUD URL and the device itself.\u00a0 The last one seems pretty important, especially given some of the points in Ekr's DISCUSS about limiting damage in case of compromised/malicious device.\u00a0 The security considerations already give some coverage in the first paragraph, but basically limited to the \"manufacturer\" groupings, and only covers the usage of the certificate extension for binding a MUD URL to a specific device.\u00a0 There's also some related text when considering what to do if the MUD URL for a given MAC address changes, but I didn't see any coverage for the general case.\u00a0 The entity using the MUD contents needs to be aware of the provenance of the URL and the risks of using a \"spoofed\" MUD from an attacker.",
