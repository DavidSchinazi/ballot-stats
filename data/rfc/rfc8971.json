        "text": "I have a few points that I think merit IESG discussion. (1) I see that several directorate reviewers expressed unease at the destination (IP and) MAC address assignment procedure for the inner VXLAN headers, and appreciate that there was extensive on-list discussion (more than I could follow).\u00a0 That said, I failed to find a clear statement of why the current text is believed to be safe, and in fact my reading of the current text is that the described procedure is *not* safe.\u00a0 Pointers to key parts of the WG discusison would be more than welcome! To take something of a high-level view of my concerns, if we think of the VXLAN as being a tunnel between VTEPs that carry encapsulated tenant traffic, then what we're trying to do is roughly like BFD between VTEPs, but we want to get fault-detection over as broad a coverage as we can (the \"outermost part of the tunnel\"), so we want to have the option of per-VNI BFD instead of just endpoint-to-endpoint (VTEP-to-VTEP). However, we end up having to do this by trying to insert a thin filter into the tenant's address space (i.e., the inner VXLAN header) and pick out the specific stream of BFD traffic that we're introducing.\u00a0 This is, in some sense, a namespace grab in what is conceptually the tenant's namespace, and we have to be careful that what we do is either guaranteed to not impact the tenant or well-documented and compartmentalized (akin to the \"well-known URIs\"). I've made comments at several places in the document that are more directly tied to specific pieces of text, but in general, if we assume that the tenant can add/remove new addresses at will within their VXLAN abstration, then any attempt to preconfigure by mutual agreement the BFD addresses to use at the VTEPs or to use the VTEP's normal (outer) address as the sentinel value seems subject to the tenant coming in and subsequently trying to use that address, leading to (some of) the tenant's traffic getting silently filtered and interpreted by the VTEP. If we were using domain names as identifiers, we could allocate something under .arpa or similar, but I think our options are more limited when numerical addresses are used. The option suggested by the rtg-dir reviewer of always using the management VNI does not suffer from this namespacing issue, though I recognize that it does reduce the scope over which fault-detection is available, for the cases when different VNIs' traffic are routed or handled differently. (2) Section 6 says: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The selection \u00a0  of the VNI number of the Management VNI MUST be controlled through \u00a0  management plane.\u00a0 An implementation MAY use VNI number 1 as the \u00a0  default value for the Management VNI.\u00a0 All VXLAN packets received on \u00a0  the Management VNI MUST be processed locally and MUST NOT be \u00a0  forwarded to a tenant. It seems like the management VNI concept is something that would apply to the entire VXLAN deployment and not just to the BFD-using portions; is this already defined somewhere (in which case we should reference it), or is it new with this document?\u00a0 In the latter case wouldn't it be an update to the core VXLAN spec?\u00a0 (I note that there are some procedural hoops to jump through for an IETF-stream document to update an ISE-stream document...)",

I change my ballot to \"ABSTAIN\" in the sense of \"I oppose this document but understand that others differ and am not going to stand in the way of the others\".
