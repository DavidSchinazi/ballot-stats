Under what circumstances would it be advisable to transfer NVO3 data unencrypted across untrusted networks?

The Security Considerations section hint around the risk of breaking the intended isolation of tenants without ever stating that possibility in the first few sections that describe securing NVEs, NVAs, and management systems.\u00a0 The risks should be explained so that the reader, including developers and implementers, understand that breaking the designed tenant isolation is possible when security requirements and considerations are not met (or there are weaknesses/flaws in software).\u00a0 This may help to further motivate implementation of security requirements. 2. The framework describes both overlay and underlay networks.\u00a0 When responding to Alissa's discuss, I would like like to see the text address when encryption is needed with the associated risks for the overlay and underlay networks as well, the answers may be different for each.\u00a0 The security considerations section goes back and forth between the two right now without always calling out which it is referring to and this would be helpful.\u00a0 This is also the case for the unauthorized access descriptions in the security considerations section.\u00a0 I'm adding this as a second discuss to make sure we can work through some text to add and these considerations are included as I think they will be helpful to address what each means for both overlay and underlay networks (management/control data and tenant data).",
