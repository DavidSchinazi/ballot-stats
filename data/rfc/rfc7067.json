        "text": "I am surprised that the WG is willing to request the publication of documents where there is known IPR, but the license terms have not been disclosed. There are multiple interpretations of this including the WG  not considering that the IPR applies, the WG not believing that the IPR is enforceable, the WG not having the issue properly exposed by the  chairs. or the WG being happy to consider paying a license for their implementations.\u00a0 Given that one of the chairs is the IPR holder, the issue needs to be treated with a high degree of caution if for no other reason than to protect the chair against claims of abuse. The Shepherd write-up points to a fumble during WG last call, but suggests the issue was handled with an additional call for comments  within the WG. The write-up also points at a slide from IETF-86. I found this at  http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/86/slides/slides-86-trill-10.pdf The disclosure (which was initially made against the -05 version of the individual I-D, and later against the -04 version of the WG I-D) has  never included licensing terms. Given that \"IETF working groups prefer technologies with no known IPR claims or, for technologies with claims against them, an offer of  royalty-free licensing\" [ RFC3979 ] I would like to understand the WG process that led to this document being sent for publication. I am sceptical that I am raising an issue that meets the IESG's Discuss criteria, but I would like to discuss the point (at least with the responsible AD) to understand that IETF process was followed  sufficiently to warrant deviating from the general case described in RFC 3979 . Then I will be able to move to No Objection with a clear conscience.",

Generic operation of Directory Assistance \u00a0  There are two different models for Directory assistance to edge \u00a0  RBridges: Push Model and Pull Model.\u00a0 The Directory Information is \u00a0  described in Section 5.1 below while Section 5.2 discusses Push Model \u00a0  requirements and Section 5.3 Pull Model requirements. I'm not seeing a statement about whether all RBridges (or at least all RBridges used with TRILL directories) are expected to support both models of operation. I'm reading 5.3 Pull Model and Requirements as saying \"yes, at least some RBridges would support both\", but I'm guessing (the text I'm looking at is). \u00a0  For RBridges with mapping entries being pushed from a directory \u00a0  server, they can be configured to use the Pull Model for targets \u00a0  which don't exist in the mapping data pushed. So, I'm asking if you can say anything helpful about that. Either \"the answer depends\" or \"we don't need to say that in the framework document\" could be fine answers, but I wanted to ask.",
