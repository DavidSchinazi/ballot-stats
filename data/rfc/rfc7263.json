However, there is no registry that keeps track of the flags in any coordinated way. Is this intentional? Second, which of the RPR or DRR draft is creating the new flag? Section 4.2., paragraph 2: >\u00a0 \u00a0 According to base draft [ I-D.ietf-p2psip-base ], SRR MUST be >\u00a0 \u00a0 supported.\u00a0 An overlay MAY be configured to use alternative routing >\u00a0 \u00a0 algorithms, and alternative routing algorithms MAY be selected on a >\u00a0 \u00a0 per-message basis.\u00a0 I.e., a node in an overlay which supports SRR and >\u00a0 \u00a0 some other routing algorithm, for example DRR, might use SRR some of >\u00a0 \u00a0 the time and DRR some of the time.\u00a0 A node joining the overlay should >\u00a0 \u00a0 get from the configuration file the preferred routing mode.\u00a0 If an >\u00a0 \u00a0 overlay runs within a private network and all peers in the system can >\u00a0 \u00a0 reach each other directly, peers MAY send most of the transactions >\u00a0 \u00a0 with DRR.\u00a0 On the contrary, using DRR SHOULD be discouraged in the \u00a0 Same point as for the RPR draft: Is \"SHOULD be discouraged\" actually \u00a0 meaning \"SHOULD NOT be used in the open Internet\"?",

I'm looking at  http://tools.ietf.org//rfcdiff?url1=http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-p2psip-rpr-11.txt&url2=http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-p2psip-drr-11.txt  and seeing a lot of duplication between these drafts. That could be OK, although some protocol machinery looks like it's defined in both drafts (for instance, 0x08 IGNORE-STATE-KEEPING), but what I hoped to see is some discussion of RPR versus DRR - when you implement RELOAD, does it make sense to pick either RPR or DDR, and then fall back to SSR, or would you expect anyone to implement both SRR and RPR, or even attempt both in succession before falling back to SSR? I would guess that attempting DDR (directly route the reply), then attempting RPR (route using a relay), and only then falling back to SSR would make sense. Is there any guidance you can give? You'll notice I'm a coauthor on  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-p2psip-concepts-05 , so if you tell me \"there's no energy for new text\", I'll believe you, but I wanted to ask ...",
