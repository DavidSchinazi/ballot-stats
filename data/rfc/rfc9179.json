I have a couple of DISCUSS points related to the IANA section, and some non blocking question. Francesca 1. ----- \u00a0  The allocation policy for this registry is First Come, First Served, \u00a0  [ RFC8126 ] as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values. FP:  RFC 8126  specifies: \u00a0  When creating a new registry with First Come First Served as the \u00a0  registration policy, in addition to the contact person field or \u00a0  reference, the registry should contain a field for change controller. \u00a0  Having a change controller for each entry for these types of \u00a0  registrations makes authorization of future modifications more clear. \u00a0  See Section 2.3. The current registry dos not contain contact person, nor reference, nor change controller fields. 2. ----- \u00a0  It should be noted that [ RFC5870 ] also creates a registry for \u00a0  Geodetic Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very \u00a0  strict modification policy.\u00a0 The authors of [ RFC5870 ] have the stated \u00a0  goal of making CRS registration hard to avoid proliferation of CRS \u00a0  values.\u00a0 As our module defines alternate systems and has a broader \u00a0  (beyond Earth) scope, the registry defined below is meant to be more \u00a0  easily modified. FP: Thanks for bringing this up - I want to confirm that we need this registry, and that we are not creating a way to bypass the CRS registration policies by providing a different registry with a more lenient policy.",
