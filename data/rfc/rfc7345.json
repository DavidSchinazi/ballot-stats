Standard SHOULD/MAY problem: MAY is not an alternative to SHOULD; MAY is entirely optional. In order to resolve this, let me first ask *why* the offerer SHOULD set \"setup\" to \"actpass\", under what conditions might the offerer need to use \"active\" or \"passive\" instead, and what are the consequences of doing that? -- Section 5.2.2 -- \u00a0  The UA MUST demultiplex packets arriving on the IP address and port \u00a0  associated with the DTLS association, e.g. as follows: I'm not sure what the \"e.g. as follows\" is saying.\u00a0 Are the two bullets meant to be one example how how one might demultiplex the packets, and there are also other ways one might do it?\u00a0 Are the two bullets a suggested way, or just an example?\u00a0 Or is there some other sense that I'm not seeing?\u00a0 (And what if the first byte of the packet is between 2 and 19?)",

From Pete's comment, the introduction is not clear as to why this solution is needed.\u00a0 When you dig deeper, (and it takes a bit of researching), you can see that a solution is needed for secure IP transport.\u00a0 I'd like to see the introduction expanded to better explain the problem and existing gap.\u00a0 The transition to IP from telephony protocols (T.30) makes sense as a major motivation.\u00a0 An issue that comes up for someone new to this is that the T.30 document explains the solution as an application layer approach that applies to any protocol, so there must be a gap here that the experts are aware of and can explain.\u00a0  With the current text on existing solutions, the reader has to know a lot more to understand T.38 RTP and UDPTL.\u00a0 The listed solutions talk about T.30 and RTP, so unless the reader knows they are competing solutions (doesn't say that in the introduction, just puts them both in the T.38 document for reference), they won't know why this doesn't fit the bill. If you start searching around,  RFC4612  section 3 must have been written before UDPTL tool off and gained the market share.\u00a0 I am including all of this so you might see where someone new to this work would need additional information in the introduction to better set the understanding for the reader. I had suspected when I read it yesterday that the main reason was that traditional faxing is going away and integration with applications is needed for how people work, but that is not said anywhere.\u00a0 Regulatory requirements also drive this with the need for transport encryption (no need to name the many ones as they will change and evolve).",
