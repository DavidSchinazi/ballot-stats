I believe you have already talked about this on e-mail and plan to do so, so I'm just checking that this was indeed the plan, and can then move on to approve the document. In more detail: the sentence currently it gives an odd impression. We already have shared address space (as the document notes elsewhere), so it is not clear to me what the above might entail, particularly when (a) regular address space assignments go through the RIR system not IANA (b) use of unassigned address space is probably not something that we want to recommend and (c) if we need to do something beyond the existing shared address space allocation, then that probably deserves its own document.",
