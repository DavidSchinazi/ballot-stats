        "text": "I have two points to discuss. Hopefully, they should be fairly easily resolved though there may be a bit of work needed. (1) The secdir review [1] I think does a good job of identifying some real security issues that will emerege and that are a consequence of the three bits of architecture described here. Inclusion of some variation of the 4 bullets from [1] would be at least a good start in improving what is clearly an deficient security considerations section (as Adrian correctly said). I think that plus some text about other fairly obvious issues (e.g. slow middlebox s/w update has prevented applying some patches or slowed down deployment of new security features, recognising the tension between SFC and privacy/confidentiality,...) should be fairly easily done with a little work from someone. \u00a0  [1]  https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg05351.html (2) The IAB have encouraged us to encrypt everything and that, and  RFC 7258 , would seem to me to be very much in tension with some aspects of this work. And the WG charter says \"The SFC WG will closely consider and address the management and security implications when documenting these deliverables.\" I see no real evidence that that has happened so far from this particular deliverable so my question is: when will you tackle the security and privacy considerations and the obvious tension between doing more inside the n/w vs. protecting users and applications? Also - don't you consider that DoS attacks are a problem that could be mitigated or made worse via SFC?\u00a0 And isn't it clear that privacy could easily be made worse if SFC is developed without real consideration of privacy trade-offs? Resolving this discuss point would ideally be done by someone pointing me at WG drafts that do substantively address these issues. (I've not looked, so it's quite possible that will be done, and if so, great.) If that is not currently possible, then we should probably talk some more about when and how that work is going to happen.\u00a0 (Translating that last bit: I'm not trying to insist that the security and privacy work needed for SFC be finished already, but I'd like to be confident that it will happen, so this DISCUSS is perhaps more for chatting with the AD and WG chairs rather than the authors of this deliverable.)",
