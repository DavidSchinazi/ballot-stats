        "text": "Length of review comments aside, this is actually a quite nice document -- thank you to the authors for making it so clear and well-organized. The only readability complaint I have is that I don't get a great picture of how all the bits of the Email object fit together, but it's complicated enough that maybe a generic schema wouldn't actually be helpful. Section 2 I think we need more precise language than \"corresponds to\" for the relationship between JMAP MailboxRights and IMAP ACLs, specifically because JMAP distinguishes mayRename and mayDelete but IMAP just has the single 'x' ACL.\u00a0 (More in the COMMENT section, but the non-isomporphic mapping of 'x' is the only DISCUSS-worthy part.) Section 4.1.1 We only describe the \"\\\" to \"$\" translation for the four supported system keywords, but it seems that it should be more generic (not that we expect more IMAP system keywords to appear anytime soon)? Section 4.1.2.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  A server SHOULD replace any octet \u00a0  or octet run with the high bit set that violates UTF-8 syntax with \u00a0  the unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).\u00a0 [...] This seems problematic, given that this is supposed to be the \"Raw\" format.\u00a0 I guess the justification for the replacement is that we use JSON and JSON requires UTF-8, but if that's the case then shouldn't this be a MUST and not a SHOULD?\u00a0 In particular, a client can't rely on the server providing the SHOULD, so it doesn't seem to provide much value. Section 4.7 \u00a0  The server MAY forbid two email objects with the same exact [ RFC5322 ] \u00a0  content, or even just with the same [ RFC5322 ] Message-ID, to coexist \u00a0  within an account; if the target account already has the email the \u00a0  copy will be rejected with a standard \"alreadyExists\" error. This has some security considerations that should probably be mentioned in Section 9.4: when a user only has read privileges to a subset of the folders in an account, this behavior can be abused as an oracle to determine whether a given message exists in the inaccessible portions of that account.\u00a0 (Similarly for /import.) Section 4.9 \u00a0  The following metadata properties on the Email objects will be \"null\" \u00a0  if requested: \u00a0  [...] \u00a0  o\u00a0 mailboxIds This seems in conflict with the Section 4.1.1 text that every Email \"MUST belong to one or more mailboxes at all times (until it is deleted).\" Presumably we want a broader disclaimer in 4.1.1 rather than any changes here... There may also be a related condition wherein an EmailSubmission object refers to an Email after the Email is deleted -- I didn't (yet) see text to indicate whether the emailId in the EmailSubmission is expected to still be resolvable, in which case there would potentially not be an associated Mailbox. Section 9.3 It's 2019.\u00a0 Why are we still recommending SASL PLAIN? We have better options even if we are resigned to passwords, like SCRAM.",
