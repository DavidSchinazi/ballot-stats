As all \u00a0  PTP terminologies and PTP data set attributes are described in \u00a0  details in IEEE 1588-2008 [IEEE1588], this document only outlines \u00a0  each of them in the YANG module.\" If I understand correctly, IEEE 1588-2008 is not available without payment. If so, then I don't see how we can assume that reviewers of this draft are actually familiar with IEEE 1588-2008. It seems like that makes it hard for the draft to get sufficient review to be considered a standards-track IETF consensus document. I recognize that we do not have a policy against normative references to paywalled sources, but I read the disclaimer to make the IEEE document more foundational than just any normative reference.",
