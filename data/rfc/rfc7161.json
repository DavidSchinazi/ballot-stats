And so I have to ask the question: what is the strong consensus for?\u00a0 Documenting this in an RFC that never gets implemented?\u00a0 Or *is* there really a strong consensus to implement this and experiment with it?\u00a0 I have no objection to publishing this as an experiment, if there's actually some commitment to try it (and then I'd like to see some commitment to report the results in some way, and perhaps to move this onto Standards Track if it works out as well as the document leads us to expect it will).\u00a0 But I do have an objection to publishing it just to publish it, if it's going to be largely ignored.",
