        "text": "Rich version of this review at: https://mozphab-ietf.devsvcdev.mozaws.net/D3890 I have not had time to give this as thorough a read as I would like, and would feel necessary were we advancing it at PS, so I am not confident in its security properties. I have nevertheless noted a number of issues that I think merit a DISCUSS. DETAIL S 2.3. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then a locally generated self-signed certificate MUST be used. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The keyUsage extension in the certificate MUST indicate that it >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is valid for digitalSignature and keyEncipherment (if available). >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The self-signed certificate SHOULD use the same subject name as >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in the PKCS #10 request.\u00a0 In this case the messageType is PKCSReq >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (see Section 3.2.1.2). Should it use the same *key* as the PKCS#10 request? S 2.3. >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Note that although the above text describes several different types >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of operations, in practice most implementations always apply the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 first one even if an existing certificate already exists.\u00a0 For this >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 reason support for the first case is mandatory while support for the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 latter ones are optional (see Section 2.9). we probably shouldn't have a SHOULD for something we know people don't do, especially in an Info document. S 2.5. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 using CMS (Section 3). >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the CA supports certificate renewal and if the CA policy permits >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then a new certificate with new validity dates can be issued even >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 though the old one is still valid.\u00a0 The CA MAY automatically revoke >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the old client certificate.\u00a0 To renew an existing certificate, the Is this sentence about automatically revoking related to the previous one? I.e., can I revoke the old certificate if the new one is not yet valid? That would seem unwise. S 3. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 confidentiality use two layers of CMS, as shown in Figure 2.\u00a0 By >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 applying both enveloping and signing transformations, the SCEP >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 message is protected both for the integrity of its end-to-end >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 transaction information and the confidentiality of its information >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 portion.\u00a0 Some messages do not require enveloping, in which case the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 EnvelopedData in Figure 2 is omitted. I want to make sure I understand which messages *do* require enveloping. I would assume PKSReq, at least if it includes the challenge password, right? Maybe I'm missing it, but i don't see a clear statement anywhere. S 3.1. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the recipient's public key.\u00a0 If the key is encryption-capable (for >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 example RSA) then the messageData is encrypted using the recipient's >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 public key with the CMS KeyTransRecipientInfo mechanism.\u00a0 If the key >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is not encryption-capable (for example DSA or ECDSA) then the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 messageData is encrypted using the challengePassword with the CMS >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PasswordRecipientInfo mechanism. This requires a very strong ChallengePassword, which I don't see you saying anywhere. S 3.1. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Note that some earlier implementations of this specification dealt >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 with non-encryption-capable keys by omitting the encryption stage, >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 based on the text in Section 3 that indicated that \"the EnvelopedData >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is omitted\".\u00a0 This alternative processing mechanism SHOULD NOT be >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 used since it exposes the challengePassword used to authorise the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 certificate issue. Why is this not a MUST? S 8.3. >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The challengePassword sent in the PKCS #10 enrolment request is >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 signed and encrypted by way of being encapsulated in a pkiMessage. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When saved by the CA, care should be taken to protect this password, >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 for example by storing a salted iterated hash of the password rather >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 than the password itself. this won't work if you are using it for encryption. S 8.7. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is public and thus encrypting the requests is of questionable value. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition CRLs and certificates sent in responses are already >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 signed by the CA and can be verified by the recipient without >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 requiring additional signing and encryption.\u00a0 More lightweight means >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of retrieving certificates and CRLs such as HTTP certificate-store >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 access [13] and LDAP are recommended for this reason. This statement appears to directly cut against  RFC 7258 , which establishes the IETF consensus that we should be considering disclosure of metadata and its impact on pervasive monitoring. A protocol which claims to have IETF consensus should not take the opposite position. In addition to this, the claim that certificates are inherently public is in fact not universally true, as discussions about redaction in CT demonstrate. Moreover, the fact that a given endpoint has given certificate is not public. S 8.8. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 default to SHA-1, with many supporting only that hash algorithm with >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 no ability to upgrade to a newer one.\u00a0 SHA-1 is no longer regarded as >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 secure in all situations, but as used in SCEP it's still safe.\u00a0 There >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 are three reasons for this.\u00a0 The first is that attacking SCEP would >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 require creating a SHA-1 collision in close to real time, which won't >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be feasible for a very long time. I don't believe that this statement reflects the consensus of the cryptographic community and it's also not clear to me that the requirement for real-time is correct without quite a bit more analysis.",
