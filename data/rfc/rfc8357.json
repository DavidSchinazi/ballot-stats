If the answer is that this is by design, and the working group thinks that the operational aspects are reasonable, then I will clear.) This extension places normative requirements on any upstream server or relay, which may or may not implement this spec.\u00a0 It further appears that if you try to use this extension without that support, things will break. That seems to require at least an update to the DCHP and DCHPv6 RFCs[1], and some method of discovery or fallback would be helpful. Section 5.4 discusses this a little bit, but I think it needs to talk about what to do when things fail. \"Turn off the feature if you don't get DHCP responses\" doesn't seem satisfying. [1] I see 3.1 and 3.2 make changes to 2131 and 3315, so it seems an \"UPDATES... \" tag is needed one way or another.",
