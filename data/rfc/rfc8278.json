        "text": "1) This document should not recommend the use of MPTCP for tunneling, as TCP-in-TCP tunnels are generally not recommend if that can be avoided. Please remove the following part from section 3.2 and leave IP-level tunneling as the only option: \u2028\u201ePacket distribution can be done either at the transport level, e.g. using MPTCP \u2026\u201c  2) Further the following sentences also in section 3.2 should be revised:\u2028 \u201eFor example, high throughput services (e.g. \u00a0  video streaming) may benefit from per-packet distribution scheme, \u00a0  while latency sensitive applications (e.g.\u00a0 VoIP) are not be spread \u00a0  over different WAN paths.\u201c\u2028\u00a0   High throughput services only benefit from per-packet scheduling if the service requires higher throughput than one of the links can provide. Also video streaming may not be a good example here because high latency variations can lead to stalls. Therefore in general per-flow scheduling should be recommend for all traffic.  It could still be beneficial to schedule flows that require low latency over the link with the lower base latency, or maybe more important lower jitter, however, often it is not known to the network what the requirements on latency are for a given flow. Therefore is should probably be recommended to schedule all traffic on the \"better\" link (where better can be pre-configured knowledge or measured) as long as the bandwidth of the incoming traffic is smaller than the bandwidth of the that link, and only use a second link (with per-flow scheduling) if the capacity is required. 3) This document does not really normative specify the use of the newly defined options. It only gives an examples but it does not specify normatively any actions that need to performed on receipt of these options. How does the MAG know if the LMA does not support Multipath binding? An LMA that does not implement this spec will not send back an error message. Why are there two different options? What happens if one of the options is present in the Proxy Binding Update but not the other?",

The very next sentence reads: \"Packet distribution can be done either at the transport level, e.g. using MPTCP or at When operating at the IP packet level, different packets distribution algorithms are possible. \" -- the fact that this sentence is a: malformed and b: hand-wavy did nothing to allay my concerns, so I read further: \"The distribution algorithm is left to implementer but whatever the algorithm is, packets distribution likely introduces packet latency and out-of-order delivery.\u00a0 LMA and MAG shall thus be able to make reordering before packets delivery.\" - I agree with the first sentence (although it is poorly worded), but the second sentence doesn't follow from the first; \"shall thus be able to\" implies that the prior text somehow provides a solution, not points out a problem (the sentence is also malformed)-- I think you mean something like \"The LMA and MAG thus need to be able reorder packets to their original order before delivery.\" This then continues with \"Sequence number can be can be used for that purpose, for example using GRE with sequence number option [ RFC5845 ].\" - I think that the actual reference should be  RFC2890 , but regardless of this, I don't think that what you are proposing works - \"The Sequence Number field is used to maintain sequence of packets **within** the GRE Tunnel.\" (from  RFC2890 , emphasis added). This means that sequence numbers are local to the tunnel, and (as I understand it) your solution involves diverse tunnels. Further, Section 2.2. Sequence Number says: \"The receiver may perform a small amount of buffering in an attempt to recover the original sequence of transmitted packets. In this case, the packet may be placed in a buffer sorted by sequence number.\" - if you are proposing using a single sequence number space for multiple tunnels, you will end up with sequence number space gabs, and lots of buffering, etc.  The section ends with: \"However, more detailed considerations on reordering\u00a0 and IP packet distribution scheme (e.g. definition of packets distribution algorithm) are out the scope of this document.\" - I think that, unless the prior paragraph is significantly reworked, it should not try and suggest any mitigations. The whole idea of striping packets of a flow across (notably) different transports seems like a really bad idea to me -- is it actually needed?",
