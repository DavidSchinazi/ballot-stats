I'd also like to discuss whether we need greater specificity in the nature of the updates applied to the Updates:'d documents.\u00a0 For example, Section 6 (of this document) says that Xection X [of  RFC7489 ] is updated \"to say that all U-labels in domains are converted to A-labels before further processing\", but most of those referenced sections contain step-by-step listings of a procedure to follow.\u00a0 It doesn't seem like much of a burden for us to say \"between steps X and X+1, insert the following step: \"[convert domain from U-label to A-label]\", and that has a potentially significant gain in clarity to the reader (and thus, interoperability).",
