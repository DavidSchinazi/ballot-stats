(B) Error Handling Many sections of the document describe functionality, or even Normatively mandate it, but there is no discussion about Error Handling. (1) Router-Id Setting \u00a74.5: \u00a0  o\u00a0 the current router-id; this is undefined at the start of the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 packet, and is updated by each Router-ID TLV (Section 4.6.7) and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by each Update TLV with Router-Id flag set.

(3) Next Hop \u00a74.6.9: \u00a0  The next-hop address for this update is taken from the last preceding \u00a0  Next Hop TLV with a matching address family (IPv4 or IPv6) in the \u00a0  same packet even if it was otherwise ignored due to an unknown \u00a0  mandatory sub-TLV; if no such TLV exists, it is taken from the \u00a0  network-layer source address of this packet. What if the Next Hop TLV doesn't exist and the network-layer doesn't correspond to the address family in the Update?\u00a0 For example, let's say IPv6 is used as the network-layer protocol and the Update contains IPv4 prefixes... (4) For the Normative behavior listed here (I may have missed other instances), I have basically the same question: what should a receiver do if it is not the case? - \u00a73.8.1.2: \"A node MUST NOT increase its sequence number by more than 1 in response to a seqno request.\" - \u00a74: \"A Babel packet MUST be sent as the body of a UDP datagram, with network-layer hop count set to 1...\"\u00a0  - \u00a74.6.9: \"If the metric is finite, AE MUST NOT be 0.\u00a0 If the metric is infinite and AE is 0, Plen and Omitted MUST both be 0.\"\u00a0  - \u00a74.6.10: \"...if AE is 0 (in which case Plen MUST be 0 and Prefix is of length 0).\" - \u00a74.6.10/\u00a74.6.11: Is AE 3 a valid value in a request?\u00a0 I assume it isn't.\u00a0 What should a receiver do if AE = 3.

In the IANA considerations section, please include the whole registry in the table to avoid confusion. Note that because of the mandatory bit, the 128-239 range should be Reserved...but it is currently marked as Unassigned.\u00a0 Even worse, value 128 is assigned already [ draft-ietf-babel-source-specific ].\u00a0 The impact may not be too bad because I doubt that Pad1 would need to be mandatory, but it at least causes confusion and inconsistency, and (as currently specified) there would be no way to differentiate between Pad1 and the Source Prefix sub-TLV.",

        "text": "I don't think that all of the arithmetic specified in Section 3.2.1 is well defined.\u00a0 Specifcally, the formulations involving bitwise AND assume that the input to the bitwise AND is nonnegative, which does not seem to be implied by the other stated constraints.\u00a0 (For example, an \"integer n\" may well be negative.)\u00a0 Some discussion of the representation of negative integers would then be needed, and then whether the mathematical operation is performed in an abstract infinite-precision machine or in a realizable approximation, etc..\u00a0 It might be simpler to just use the modular arithmetic flavor and avoid any of the issues that can arise when providing two alternative definitions that are intended to be equivalent (since there is always a risk of edge cases). Section 3.5.2 needs to explicitly say that the c and m arguments to M() are the local link cost and the advertised metric, e.g., \"the function M(c, m) used for computing a metric from a locally computed link cost c and the metric m advertised by a neighbor\". Section 3.8.2.1 notes that \"[d]ue to duplicate suppression, only a small number of such requests will actually reach the source.\" (for seqno requests intending to avoid starvation).\u00a0 But Section 3.8.1.2 only has a SHOULD-level requirement to suppress duplicate seqno requests, so I think there is an internal inconsistency. I think we may need to have a discussion about the feasibility of multicast acknowledgment requests with only a 16-bit nonce.\u00a0 With random assignment of nonces the risk of birthday collisions becomes uncomfortably large, and non-random assignments are likely to have worse pathologies.\u00a0 (A pointer to a previous discussion of this topic would, of course, short-circuit a lot of it if not all of it.)\u00a0 Are we willing to make hard assumptions about the maximum size of a multicast domain and the risk of collision we are willing to accept? The discussion in Section 4.6.9 of computing the prefix from an Update message (and parser state) seems a little underspecified when the prefix length is not a multiple of 8 bits.\u00a0 (Additionally, \"Plen\" is not described as measuring bits, explicitly, for any of the PDU descriptions that I remember.)\u00a0 Specifically, the \"Prefix\" description does not mention that any trailing bits must be set to zero, but the subsequent discussion about the prefix is \"computed as follows\" refers to assembling the prefix as a collection of octets, including trailing zero octets, implying that the computed prefix is the full length of the address type. I appreciate that we have some discussion in Section 4.5 about the need for a stateful parser for the babel packet body; this seems like one of the riskiest areas of the protocol from the implementation perspective. However, I think it would be even more helpful to explicitly call out what pieces of state are needed, what protocol elements affect the state, and what ordering requirements (or non-requirements) there are for the interactions between the different protocol elements that affect parser state.\u00a0 Can we have a discussion about whether it's appropriate to add some text along these lines?",
