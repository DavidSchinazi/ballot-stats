(Definitions) refers to a couple of \u201cexisting IGP timers\u201d.\u00a0 I understand the concepts, but can you please reference the IGP documents where these timers are defined?\u00a0 I quickly checked  rfc2328  and couldn\u2019t find a specific place that talked about LSP_GEN_TIMER (or LSA, of course!), or a similar concept.\u00a0 SPF_DELAY seems to be introduced by I-D.ietf-rtgwg-backoff-algo.\u00a0 Given that the rest of Section 5. (Specification) is built on these \u201cexisting IGP timers\u201d, I think that the references should be Normative. Note also that the description in Section 5.2. (Current IGP reactions) is described (in 5.3) as the \u201cstandard IP convergence\u201d and carries a \u201cMUST\u201d associated with it.\u00a0 It was mentioned (in 5.1) that the timers in question are \u201coften associated with a damping mechanism\u201d, which is not part of the base IGP specifications.  I\u2019m putting this comment in as a DISCUSS given that understanding the definitions (and having then Normative references) is necessary for the implementation of the mechanism described.\u00a0 I think it should be easy to resolve by just adding the appropriate references.",
