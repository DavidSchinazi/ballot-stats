The content is really interesting to read (especially for a private pilot!); albeit, it appears more like a roadmap / plan to use IETF protocols for aviation rather than being focused only on LDACS. Please find below some blocking DISCUSS points, some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. I also support Alvaro Retana's DISCUSS on using the right publication stream, which should have been ISE in this case as often done for documents describing specifications done outside the IETF. I notice that this document as an \"unknown\" status for the consensus boilerplate and setting it to \"No\" (if possible) would probably address Alvaro's concern. Special thanks to: - Pascal Thubert for the shepherd's write-up including the WG consensus and the intended status.  - Carlos Bernardos for his INT directorate review at  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/int-dir/oRK9fXWx48Xj6VhdJMMarEPFB3c/  which also raises the same issue as Alvaro but also has other points deserving a reply I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Section 4 Raising a DISCUSS just to get a discussion with authors, RAW WG, ICAO representatives, and the community: \u00a0 \"There is currently no \"IPv6 over LDACS\" specification \u00a0  publicly available; however, SESAR2020 has started the testing of \u00a0  IPv6-based LDACS testbeds.\" Is the plan to have this \"IPv6 over LDACS\" be specified in an IETF WG (e.g., intarea) ? Or will ICAO work alone on this specification (and perhaps not using the experience of the IETF community)? ## Section 5.2.1 Let me share Carlos' point, which I second (it would be enough to state the intention about MIPv6 to address it): - \"Technically the FCI multilink concept will be realized by multi-homed mobile IPv6 networks in the aircraft.\" --> how is Mobile IPv6 going to be used and which specific protocol of the Mobile IPv6 family? just MIPv6 and/or PMIPv6? implications on mobility and RAW are unclear at this point (probably this is for the RAW WG to evaluate, but just wanted to point it out).",

This content and the process to arrive at consensus as enumerated in Alvaro\u2019s ballot leads me to share his concerns on the ability to meet the rough consensus bar set by  RFC8789  to become an IETF stream RFC. Finally, as I noted in my original DISCUSS position, I do not believe this work is in scope for the WG. ==[ DISCUSS on -10 ** With the upfront acknowledgement that I have little familiarity with LDACS, I had significant difficulty in assessing the alignment of most this document to the defined charter of RAW.\u00a0 It appears to me that only a narrow portion of the document is in-charter scope. References were provided for LDACS (e.g., [ICAO2015]), but as they were behind a paywall I was not able to review them.\u00a0 Relying primarily on Section 7.3 and Figure 3 of the [MAE20192], it appears that LDACS is a series of technologies that operate below layer-3.\u00a0 Operating on top of LDACS at layer3+ is the FCI.\u00a0 Section 4 reminds us that \u201cThe IPv6 architecture for the aeronautical telecommunication network is called the FCI.\u201d\u00a0  Per the RAW charter, \u201cRAW will stay abstract to the radio layers underneath, addressing the Layer 3 aspects in support of applications requiring high reliability and availability.\u201d\u00a0 With that in mind, I was looking for the in scope RAW work items to produce \u201cUse Cases, Requirements, Architecture/Framework Aspects for a Wireless Network, and an Evaluation of Existing IETF Technologies and Gap Analysis\u201d for technologies at or above layer 3.\u00a0 In Section 5.2.3, I first found specifics on FCI that appear to a use cases within that scope.\u00a0 In Section 7.3.3,\u00a0 there is text on the SNP which describes activity germane to handling layer-3 services.\u00a0 However, this section also excludes this work as out of scope -- \u201c[t]his work is ongoing and not part of this document.\u201d In my assessment the overwhelming majority of the text in this document is describing technologies and architecture not in RAW\u2019s in-scope remit of layer 3+.  If the WG finds documenting this otherwise paywalled information in an information document valuable, I see no issue keeping this material in an Appendix.\u00a0 However, the framing of this document needs to be clearer to highlight the in-scope materials around FCI. ** Section 9.\u00a0 Please explicitly document the Security Considerations of FCI (i.e., the IPv6/layer behaviors).\u00a0 Is that Section 9.2? -- Section 9, Per \u201cThese requirements imply that LDACS must provide layer 2 security in addition to any higher layer mechanisms\u201d, it isn\u2019t clear how this is in-scope given the remit of RAW (see above). -- Section 9.1 is helpful background but what of that applies to layer 3?\u00a0 The specifics in the threat analysis of [STR2016] and the advent of SDRs appears to be largely data link considerations. -- Section 9.2\u00a0 How does [MAE20181] inform layer 3 threats as it\u2019s explicitly focused on data link issues? -- Section 9.3.\u00a0 Which of these security objectives apply to the FCI? -- Section 9.5.3.\u00a0 Architecturally, it isn\u2019t clear how IPSec, TLS are being used by the FCI. ==[ COMMENTs on -10 I was unable to review the security claims of this document as several of the references were not available to me. For example, [ARI2021],  [ICAO2015], and [ICA2018].\u00a0 I leave it the judgement of the responsible AD to that the WG had appropriate access and that they are being appropriately used.",
