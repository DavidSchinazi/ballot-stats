It's even confusing: what if the IPFIX specs in this document are not inline with the  RFC7011  specs (we could debate: he templates can be exchanged as frequently as required given the reliability of the connection) ? Do you need more that: MUST follow the IPFIX specs? Btw, I have not seen this sentence. The closest one is:  \u00a0  This document assumes that the NAT device will use the existing IPFIX \u00a0  framework to send the log events to the collector.  However, even if not clearly mentioned, I believe your goal is to specify information elements and related encoding, and no specific \"export protocol\" (IPFIX or syslog). Is that right? If yes, then you probably want: \u00a0  if the export protocol is IPFIX, this draft MUST follow the IPFIX specs [ RFC7011 ] Kind of obvious I admit. However, right now, your draft is not clear: a little bit of rewritten IPFIX specs, but not all and no clear link to  RFC7011 What does the following SHOULD want to say: \u00a0  However, the information that is logged \u00a0  SHOULD be the same irrespective of what kind of encoding scheme is \u00a0  used.  - I agree with Jari's DISCUSS. You have some semantic for these \"events\". What if some of the fields are not present. What is the consequence on the implied semantic. For an example, look at  RFC 5476 :  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5476#section-6.5",

In all that time did anybody consider whether or not we ought define different modes of logging, with different privacy implications, as suggested e.g. in Kathleen's comments - one could have a normal/default mode that's typically used and more privacy friendly, and an \"I might be under attack\" mode that's more intrusive but useful in such situations? If not, why was that not considered given that CGN logging can be very intrusive and is open to some forms of abuse? (Note that I'm not asserting that such modes absolutely need to be visible in the RFC, I'm asking was that considered.) (2) In an overall system that uses this kind of logging, how would one control the duration for which events are stored? Would or should that need to be visible in this e.g. in a template? I figure the answer is probably no, but just wanted to check in case we ought be defining an IE for \"max. retention duration\" here or something similar that might be needed e.g. if different cross-border requirements applied to CGN boxes in different jurisdictions using one log service.
