        "text": "(1) I have a fairly fundamental concern about this document that I'd like to discuss. My impression is that most B2BUAs in the market today that handle DTLS-SRTP do so with the explicit purpose of accessing the media. That is, if I need a box that doesn't access the media I use a SIP proxy, and if I need one that does access it I use a B2BUA. I realize that there are more flavors of B2BUA defined in  RFC 7092 , but in terms of how real SBCs work, it seems to me that they break DTLS-SRTP intentionally if they do so at all.  If that's the case, the question then arises about the value of writing down normative recommendations that are more than likely to be ignored. Perhaps this document would have made more sense as informational, offering a non-normative explanation of what a B2BUA should do if it does not want to break e2e security. Even as an informational document it's still not obvious to me that there is much at all to say here for media-aware B2BUAs that isn't entirely reductive -- \"don't terminate DTLS-SRTP if you don't want to break DTLS-SRTP\" -- but at least as an informational document it wouldn't be suggesting normative requirements that are out of sync with real deployments. Could you articulate the reasons why someone would build a B2BUA that follows the recommendations in this draft? I note that the draft says nothing about using a TURN server as a media relay, which seems like it would be more common than using a B2BUA for the same purpose. Aren't B2BUAs typically deployed *because* they are media-aware? (2) Taking into account the above comment, I think 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.2 are problematic. 3.1.2.1 creates a normative SHOULD NOT-level requirement for inspection B2BUAs without explaining what the exception cases are, and 3.1.2.2 creates no normative requirements for modification B2BUAs. It's not even clear to me why the distinction is being drawn between the two kinds of B2BUAs if the bottom line is that in both cases the recommendation is to not terminate DTLS-SRTP. But this brings us back to the above comment. The problem here seems to be that what the WG and the IETF would want to say here is that B2BUAs MUST NOT terminate DTLS-SRTP to man-in-the-middle the media, but that is what B2BUAs generally do, so instead the text waffles and the recommendations are watered down and unclear. (3) The characterization of the  RFC 4474  mechanism seems to contradict the way the mechanism is actually specified. The 4474 mechanism was designed such that intermediaries would be able to provide signatures on behalf of users (e.g., see  RFC 4474  Section 3, \"This specification allows either a user agent or a proxy server to provide identity services and to verify identities ... in the initial use of this mechanism, it is likely that intermediaries will instantiate the authentication service role\"). So the claim that terminating DTLS-SRTP would cause 4474 identity and integrity checks to fail isn't true, because an SBC can decrypt and re-sign the request itself. A B2BUA that bridges two administrative domains can check the validity of the signature in the domain on on side as authorization to form a new signature that is valid in the domain in the other side. The fact that user-provided identity assertions are not guaranteed to persist end-to-end is one key reason for the ongoing work in the STIR WG. The work there and elsewhere shows that it's fairly widely acknowledged that 4474 has not seen the deployment that was hoped for when it was specified. Making its use a normative requirement here again seems out of sync with deployment reality. I would encourage you to review  draft-ietf-stir-rfc4474bis  and reconsider what security mechanism should form the basis of the recommendations in this draft.",

        "text": "I wonder if you've gotten wrapped around the axle here knowing that we won't standardise a (D)TLS MitM, but yet trying to describe things that basically are often deployed as MitMs.\u00a0 Anyway, while I do agree with Alissa's discuss, I also have some additional points to raise, some of which I think came up when we had some mail exchanges about an earlier version of this draft back in January of this year. (1) Alissa is correct that the unqualified SHOULD NOT \"terminate\" DTLS is insufficient, but in addition to her call for qualification of that, (or I guess moving to a MUST NOT,) I would like to chat about the consequences should one (for whatever reason) ignore that SHOULD NOT. Whether or not this discuss point is worth talking about depends on how Alissa's discuss on this is resolved.\u00a0 It seems to me (as I said back in January) that keeping the SHOULD NOT would mean that any UA that is able to inter-operate with a B2BUA that does \"terminate\" DTLS (because it fits with whatever qualifiers you end up adding to the SHOULD NOT) can never ever be confident of the identity of any DTLS peer (since it has code that lets the call happen regardless of the DTLS-layer peer identity). I can't see how that wouldn't make the Internet worse, hence the discuss. (2) In the introduction you say \"B2BUAs terminating DTLS-SRTP session are outside the scope of this document.\" yet if you keep the SHOULD NOT and don't move that to a MUST NOT (which was an option we discussed back in Jan, I assume the WG didn't like that?), then you are in fact including those are within the scope of this document and therefore you would need to specify how to \"terminate\" a DTLS or DTLS-SRTP session when one is a B2BUA but yet respect  RFC2804 .\u00a0 I just can't see how one might do that to be honest. (3) 3.1.2 says: \"There are two types of media-aware relays, those that merely inspect the RTP headers and unencrypted portions of RTCP packets, and those that inspect and modify the RTP headers and unencrypted portions of RTCP packets.\" Logically, those are not the only options, as one can modify the encrypted portions too. (Hopefully resulting in the integrity checking causing the packets to be dropped.) I think this particular lack of clarity does raise to the level of a DISCUSS as it's crucial for this document to be clear about not standardising a MitM. (\"Sins of omission\" are  probably not a good idea here:-) (4) 3.1.2.2 says: \"This security and privacy problem can be mitigated by having different keys for protecting RTP header integrity and encrypting the RTP payload.\u00a0 For example, the approach discussed in [ I-D.jones-perc-private-media-reqts ] can be used.\" I have two issues with that. First, where is having different keys documented? If only in the draft referenced, then what is the status of that? And secondly, doesn't perc require a KMS to exist? In which case I can't see how this specification works for calls between UAs (via a B2BUA) where there is no KMS. I think there are both security and interop (and hence also process) issues with what you're saying here. (5) 3.2 says: \"the ClientHello message from a B2BUA (acting as DTLS client)\" I don't see how a B2BUA can send it's own ClientHello (as opposed to forwarding a UA's) unless it is a MitM.\u00a0 Since we do not standardise MitM (cf.  RFC2804 ) this text must be wrong or out of place?",
