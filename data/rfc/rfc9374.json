AFAICT there's no unambiguous way to parse this. My guess is that it's meant to mean \"this is the suite we think you should use\". Whatever the intended meaning, please elaborate to make the meaning clear. I suggest removing the notation from the table, and providing prose in some appropriate section instead, with \"RECOMMENDED\" if you think the  RFC 2119  keyword is needed. If desired, you could xref that section from the table, although I don't think that's really necessary. This comment also applies to the similar lines in \u00a73.4.1, \u00a73.4.1.1, and \u00a73.4.2. The use in \u00a73.4.1.1 is especially confounding, since the prose right before the table tells us that (all of) \"the following EdDSA curves are required\" (but evidently not REQUIRED)... but only some of the required curves are RECOMMENDED? I definitely have no clue, then, what \"RECOMMENDED\" means in this section.  RFC 2119  basically defines RECOMMENDED as a weaker form of REQUIRED, but that doesn't seem to be how you're using it. Similarly, I have no clue what \"RECOMMENDED\" is meant to mean in its several uses in \u00a78.2 and \u00a78.4. I suggest simply removing it from those sections entirely.

Since this section is describing a generic ORCHID technique, does this mean one could potentially choose a 0 or 1 bit hash output size?\u00a0 All the provided security analysis is predicated on a 64-bit HIT.\u00a0 What is associated analysis and security considerations for smaller HITs? -- Section 3.5.1. \u00a0  The header content consists \u00a0  of the Prefix, the Additional Information (\"Info\"), and OGA ID (HIT \u00a0  Suite ID).\u00a0  Secondly, the length of the resulting hash is set by sum \u00a0  of the length of the ORCHID header fields.\u00a0  The second sentence is true only if ORCHID setup is according to the DRIP spec: p=28, info=28, OGA-ID=8 to make 64 bits.\u00a0 However, this is a generic update to define an ORCHID.\u00a0 The previous text said that an OGA-ID could be 4 bits \u2013 28+28+4 = 60, so if the \u201cresulting hash should be set by the length of the ORCHID header field\u201d, it would be off by 4 bits. ** Section 4.2 \u00a0  A mapping service (e.g., DNS) MUST provide a trusted (e.g., via \u00a0  DNSSEC [ RFC4034 ]) conversion of the 4-character Manufacturer Code to \u00a0  high-order 58 bits (Prefix | HID) of the HHIT. Can this \u201ctrust\u201d be described in more detail?\u00a0 Section 4.4 makes it a point to say \u201ccryptographically bind all content in the ORCHID through the hashing function.\u00a0 A recipient of a DET that has the underlying HI can directly trust and act on all content in the HHIT\u201d.\u00a0 Here this information is being split.\u00a0 Is the out-of-scope mechanism expected to provide a similar guarantee? ** Section 4.6 \u00a0  The EdDSA25519 HI (Section 3.4) underlying the DET can be used in an \u00a0  84-byte self-proof attestation (timestamp, HHIT, and signature of \u00a0  these) to provide proof of Remote ID ownership (GEN-1 in [ RFC9153 ]). \u00a0  In practice, the Wrapper and Manifest authentication formats \u00a0  (Sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 of [drip-authentication]) implicitly \u00a0  provide this self-attestation.\u00a0 A lookup service like DNS can provide \u00a0  the HI and registration proof (GEN-3 in [ RFC9153 ]). \u00a0  Similarly, for Observers without Internet access, a 200-byte offline \u00a0  self-attestation could provide the same Remote ID ownership proof. \u00a0  This attestation would contain the HDA's signing of the UA's HHIT, \u00a0  itself signed by the UA's HI.\u00a0 Only a small cache that contains the \u00a0  HDA's HI/HHIT and HDA meta-data is needed by the Observer.\u00a0 However, \u00a0  such an object would just fit in the ASTM Authentication Message \u00a0  (Section 2.2 of [ RFC9153 ]) with no room for growth.\u00a0 In practice, \u00a0  [drip-authentication] provides this offline self-attestation in two \u00a0  authentication messages: the HDA's certification of the UA's HHIT \u00a0  registration in a Link authentication message whose hash is sent in a \u00a0  Manifest authentication message. I\u2019m having trouble following along on where the guidance for offline verification is described \u2013 who exactly signs what with what key and in what format is this stored.\u00a0 Is this considered in-scope for this document?\u00a0 Given the asserted security properties,  -- I\u2019ll note that  draft-ietf-drip-auth  is an informative reference. -- What exactly needs to be in the offline Observer\u2019s cache?\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t find that in draft-ietf-drip-auth. -- Why is the first sentence in the first paragraph present?\u00a0 It is describing a hypothetical situation that isn\u2019t used in DRIP.\u00a0 Likewise, the first sentence of the second paragraph also seems like a hypothetical using verbs like \u201ccould provide\u201d -- The text reference a lookup service, how does that service an offline Observer?   ** Section 9.\u00a0  \u00a0  Therefore, the HHIT registration and HHIT/HI registration validation \u00a0  is strongly recommended.
