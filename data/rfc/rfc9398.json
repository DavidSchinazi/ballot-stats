        "text": "# \u00c9ric Vyncke, INT AD, comments for  draft-ietf-pim-igmp-mld-proxy-yang-08 CC @evyncke Thank you for the work put into this document. As I cannot agree with the section 2.3, I am balloting ABSTAIN as it does not fit any DISCUSS criteria (which would be my personal choice). Please find below one non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated about my ABSTAIN), and one nit. Special thanks to Stig Venaas for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus *but* missing the justification of the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## COMMENTS ### Section 2.3 Having two different branches for MLD and IGMP can only lead to operational difficulties as two branches need to be handled. Operators won't have a easy way to manage both MLD and IGMP in the same network. I expressed *exactly* the same point for  RFC 8652 . Isn't it defeating the purpose of having a data model ? ## NITS ### Yang in uppercase Please use YANG in all uppercase (notably in the RFC title) as it is an acronym. ## Notes This review is in the [\"IETF Comments\" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the [`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into individual GitHub issues.
