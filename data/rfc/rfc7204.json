If a system doesn't provide the services to keep the binding between the label and the object or the user's identity and it's privileges how are you going to get MAC to work? 2) s3.3: I think it's noble that clients reject anything it doesn't understand, but I gotta admit that if I was a bad guy I'd kind of ignore that requirement and keep on accepting whatever data I wasn't supposed to get.\u00a0  Would a better requirement be to check that before allowing access a common policy MUST be negotiated?\u00a0 Oh wait that's in s3.4 - should the concept of before allowing access be worked in to s3.4? 3) s3.5: I don't follow why this isn't a MUST: \u00a0 The server is allowed to translate the label but SHOULD NOT change \u00a0 the semantic meaning of the label. If the server changes the semantic meaning of the label will the client still know what it means and then doesn't that conflict with an earlier requirement:  a security label MUST always mean  exactly the same thing on every system. Doesn't it have to be \"MUST NOT change the semantic meaning of the label\"?",
