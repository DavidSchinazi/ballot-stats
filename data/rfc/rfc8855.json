First, Section 5.1 should be clear that when used over a reliable transport, not only should the F flag be ignore but that the fragment fields (last four bytes) are not in the packet. Second, Section 6.2.3 should be clear that the header accompanies all fragments. As a result, the current formula for calculating the number of fragments is probably wrong.

Did I miss it? During my review, I did not see a definition of \"transaction failure window\". I can guess what that means, but would love to know for sure. I'm understanding that in  RFC 4582 , the version number (1) was a version number, but in this draft, version 1 means \"reliable transport\" and version 2 means \"unreliable transport\". Is that right? If so, how does an  RFC 4582  TCP-only floor control server receive a message with a version field set to 2, which would have been sent over UDP? I'm also wondering whether overloading the version number field as a transport reliability indicator would cause a problem in the future. If you end up with a mandatory extension that applies to both reliable and unreliable transport, does that mean you'd use two version numbers (possibly 2 for reliable and 3 for unreliable)? Within Gorry's review, these are the points I thought were Discuss-worthy. It's probably best for you to reply to these in his e-mail, rather than try to juggle two sets of overlapping comments. I'm just pointing out what I think matters most. On the others, please do the right thing. - Gorry asked in Section 5: What is the security model when TLS/DTLS is not used? - has the protocol protection from off-path attacks, and how is this provided? I'm especially interested in this question when unreliable transport is used without DTLS. This is probably related to the question about randomizing Conference ID later in Gorry's review. -  Payload Length: - What happens when using a datagram format if the datagram length (e.g. UDP-Length) is less or more than the value specified within the BFCP? - Fragment Length: - What happens if the datagram length (e.g. UDP-Length) is less or more than the value specified within the BFCP?",
