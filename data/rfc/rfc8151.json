There is one specific transport requirement on timing as stated in David Black's transport review (Thanks!) that must be addressed before publication but other parts could also benefit from stating requirements explicitly and clearly (also see some comment in David's review). It also not clear what these use cases and potential requirements derived from them means in terms of needed protocol work in nvo3. From me it's not clear at all if nvo3 networks are actually that much different compared to existing virtual networks such that any additional protocol work is needed.",
