I'm also concerned that there is too much intermingling of general BCP-worthy advice with implementation-specific knowledge for publication as BCP in the current form.\u00a0 I've tried to note instances of this in the comment section, but for example this includes talking about the \"key file\" and the format of the configuration file.\u00a0 In a similar vein, it's unclear that the guidance in Appendix A will age well, at least without a more explicit disclaimer (including disclaimer of normativity) -- e.g,. are the -4 and -6 modifiers to restrict still needed or best practice?\u00a0 IIRC a recent update on my FreeBSD machine updated ntp.conf to just use basic restrict stanzas without an IP version. I'm also surprised to see no discussion of the (non-)applicability of IPsec for NTP traffic, when authenticity or access control is required.\u00a0 (E.g., where IP acls are discussed in Section 5.1)",

        "text": "Rich version of this review at: https://mozphab-ietf.devsvcdev.mozaws.net/D3844 I notice that a number of the recommendations here differ from those in NDSS16. In particular the following recommendations from that paper do not seem to appear: - Do not put INIT in the reference ID on restart - Do not send KoD - Disable fragmentation - Randomize source ports I'm not saying that all of these recommendations need to be in this document, but I am curious why they are not and would tend to think that one should document why they are not.

What practices can I engage in as an NTP server that mitigate source spoofing attacks? The next paragraph seems to largely talk about traffic *sources*. Is the assumption that the NTP server is supposed to do  BCP 38  filtering? That seems not that effective. As a smaller point, I see that this text says \"should\", not SHOULD. Is that a mistake or is this intended not to have any normative force? S 3.2. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [ RFC5905 ].\u00a0 It is RECOMMENDED that that NTP users select an >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 implementation that is actively maintained.\u00a0 Users should keep up to >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 date on any known attacks on their selected implementation, and >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 deploy updates containing security fixes as soon as practical. >\u00a0   >\u00a0  3.2.\u00a0 Use enough time sources I note that you don't seem to be recommending that people use Chronos ( http://wp.internetsociety.org/ndss/wp- content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/ndss2018_02A-2_Deutsch_paper.pdf), which, as I understand it, is compatible with existing NTP servers but far more resistant to spoofing. Is there a reason why? Assuming that there is a good reason, that seems like it should be covered here. S 3.2. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 See Section 3.7.1 for more information. >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Operators SHOULD monitor all of the time sources that are in use.\u00a0 If >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 time sources do not generally agree, find out the cause and either >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 correct the problems or stop using defective servers.\u00a0 See >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Section 3.5 for more information. It's not really possible to evaluate this advice without any description of the threat model, which is pretty sketchily covered below. In particular, if an attacker controls my network, then it's basically like having one NTP server, no matter how many people I am talking to, and even an inaccurate but secure server (e.g., tlsdate) is superior.
