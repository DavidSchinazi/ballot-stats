        "text": "Below is Sue Hares' OPS DIR review. I would like to DISCUSS some points. I'm of two minds. On one side, I read: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The scope of this memo is limited to these three areas of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  experimentation.\u00a0 This memo expresses no view on the likely outcomes \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  of the proposed experiments and does not specify the experiments in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  detail.\u00a0 Additional experiments in these areas are possible, e.g., on \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  use of ECN to support deployment of a protocol similar to DCTCP \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-tcpm-dctcp ] beyond DCTCP's current applicability that is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  limited to data center environments.\u00a0 The purpose of this memo is to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  remove constraints in standards track RFCs that stand in the way of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  these areas of experimentation. On the other side: \u00a0  An Experimental RFC MUST be published for any protocol \u00a0  or mechanism that takes advantage of any of these enabling updates. Btw, the MUST is just plain wrong, as Ben mentioned. So, if you go in the direction of providing requirements for the experiments (as opposed to just removing the specification constraints), then I agree with Sue. The document title goes in the direction: if it would say something such as \"Removing constraints to the ECN experimentation\", that would be a different story. Reviewer: Susan Hares Review result: Has Issues This is an OPS-DIR Review which focus the work on issues in deployed technology based on this RFC. Summary: Has issues as guide to experimental RFC .\u00a0 To me these operational issues General comment: Thank you david for addressing this Area.\u00a0 Better ECN control is critical to many portions of the network. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  My comments on this draft are because I \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  really hope you can do quality experiments. How this might be resolved: if there is a operational guidelines section (or separate document), that covered: a) how to set-up and determine if a ECT(1) experiment success or fails b) how to manage your ECT(1) experiment in your network. c) how to manage and detect if your ECT experiment is running into problems with other IETF technology (TRILL, MPLS VPNs, IPVPNs, BIER and NV03 technology). d) Recommending a monitoring structure (e.g. yang modules, netconf/restconf and monitoring tools0 Major issues: #1 There is nothing in this document which provide guidelines to the authors of experimental RFCs based in this draft on specific ways to \u00a0 \u00a0 monitor the ECN experiments, report the ECN experimental data, or disable \u00a0 \u00a0 the experimental data.\u00a0  If the success or failure of an experiment is \u00a0 \u00a0 based on \"popular vote\" determined by deployment, then say state this \u00a0 \u00a0 point.\u00a0 I personally would object to that \u00a0  because you cannot tell if a limited experiment in a specific location (E.g. \u00a0  a data center) might be successful in another location. \u00a0 If the success or failure of an experimental RFC is based on a specific set \u00a0 of criteria for ECN, then it would be good to give an operational suggestion \u00a0 on how to: a) design an experiment, b) run an experiment and collect data, \u00a0 and c) report ths  data in order to standardize the ECN experiments using ECT(1).  page 10 section 4.2 last 2 paragraphs in sentence, hinted that you have an  experiment in mind without specifying the experiment's success or failure  criteria other than popular vote.\u00a0 Is this true?\u00a0 if it is, this is  problematic.\u00a0 If I misunderstood your text, then please have someone re-read the text. I have read lots of papers on ECN. 2) No discussion was given on how the TCP layer experimentation would impact routing layer handdlng of ECN. For example, the trill WG has the draft draft-ietf-trill-ecn-support.  Automated tunnel set-up for MPLS VPNS or IP VPNS may look at the ECN ECT(0)\u00a0 or ECT(1).\u00a0 TRILL's ECN supports the layer-2 within the data centers.\u00a0 Some IP VPNS or MPLS VPNS may be needed for the data-center to business site  or data-center backup traffic.  As written, this draft allows loosening of the  RFC3168  draft but does not  provide guidelines\u00a0 for network interaction. 3)\u00a0 Some networks also use the diff-service markings to guide traffic in the network. \u00a0 \u00a0 This document does not suggest an operational check list on how to design \u00a0 \u00a0 an experiment that supports or does not support these markings. 4) Modern operational IETF protocols and data modules for automating the tracking of these experiments should be suggests",
