Looking over the registries at https://www.iana.org/assignments/alto-protocol/alto-protocol.xhtml  and comparing against the mechanisms defined in this document, it seems that we need to register the \"ane-path\" Cost Metric.\u00a0 More worryingly, there is no registry on that page in which the \"array\" cost mode could be registered, and it seems that using any value other than \"numerical\" or \"ordinal\" would violate a \"MUST\" in \u00a710.5 of  RFC 7285 .\u00a0 This seems to present some procedural difficulties, especially now that this document is targeting Experimental status rather than Proposed Standard (which, to be clear, I think was the right thing to do).",

In my review, there doesn\u2019t appear to be wide operational usage or implementations of this extension to inform these obfuscation procedures.\u00a0 Furthermore, it appears that these procedures remain an open research question.\u00a0 I appreciate the helpful references to the academic papers in Section 11 ([NOVA], [RESA][ MERCATOR])\u00a0 but their practical applicability to the generic capability provided by this extension appears to be difficulty to align and be caveated.\u00a0 For example, [RESA] and [MERCATOR] made what appear to be significant assumptions on their approaches, \u201cIn this paper, we assume a semi-honest security model, i.e., the aggregator and all member networks will not deviate from the security protocol, but merely try to gather information during the execution of the protocol\u201d.\u00a0  I believe this document needs to be provide a stronger applicability statement constraining where it can be fielded and what assumptions are made about the trust models.\u00a0 Additionally, given the uncertainty on the generic feasibility of obfuscation, this document should be published as experimental.",
