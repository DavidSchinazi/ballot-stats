        "text": "I would like to hear why this is being put forward now as informational instead of bringing this to STOX (or a different WG) and doing the proper work to do either a BCP or standards track document. There are quite a few problems still in this document that should get proper review, and I'm afraid that the instructions in here will be taken as IETF consensus to do these things, statements about not being normative notwithstanding. As far as technical concerns: Section 2: \u00a0  Because many of the features that a CUSAX client would prefer in one \u00a0  protocol would also be available in the other, clients should make it \u00a0  possible for such features to be disabled for a specific account. Disabled by whom? I believe in Jingle there is a way for the client to discover whether or not voice or video features are available; I presume that SIP has something similar to indicate the lack of IM/presence features. Are you simply saying that clients should be able to track which features are available per protocol, even if they show the combination of features on a per-remote-user basis? Section 3.1: I understand the desire for the server to pre-populate XMPP vcards with the SIP URI it knows about, but that's no different than the server pre-populating any fields (e.g., email address, web page) that it knows about because the server is providing all of those services, so I'm not sure why this case is special. But I don't get this: \u00a0  To ensure that the foregoing approach is always respected, service \u00a0  providers might consider (1) preventing clients (and hence users) \u00a0  from modifying the vCard \"tel\" fields... \u00a0   That encourages horribly unfriendly server behavior. It's one thing for a server to keep it's own particular locked field in a vcard for information that it knows about, and it's fine for server policy _independent of CUSAX_ to be that users can't change their contact information, but this suggestion amounts to \"If you have been letting users change *any* of their vcard telephone information (be it their lab extension, their home phone number, their fax number), and you decide to provide CUSAX services, lock down the tel fields in their vcards completely.\" That's terrible advice and harmful to users. Applying validation is the only good advice to give here. Section 3.3, second paragraph, does not take into account out of band information. If you had stuck to the first part of the sentence, where it's only talking about using the information as a hint, I would not complain, but what appears in the roster entry is far from the only place this information is gleaned by clients. (I wish clients would update the rest of the vcard in rosters from directory information they possess, but they often don't.) Don't say things that will encourage clients to *take away* functionality. Section 3.4, last paragraph. I don't get this. You seem to be talking about the case where I have an XMPP roster entry with a tel URI in it, and I am on a CUSAX client that is also talking to a SIP service. Assuming I (the user) have not configured the client to only use SIP, I'm *always* going to offer XMPP telephony if it's available and I don't have a pre-existing relationship configured between the URI and a particular service. I don't understand what the last sentence adds. Section 4, first paragraph: s/would normally be disabled/might be disabled. Also, the same problem exists here with figuring out who is providing the information. Do you mean that a CUSAX-aware SIP conference server can provide an XMPP MUC and a CUSAX-aware MUC server can provide a SIP URI?",
