        "text": "I have a whole bunch of problems with this draft, but understand that this is part of way to get out of the current not so great situation.\u00a0 Many of my comments lined up with the secdir review, but since Stewart called it out in his discuss I'll support him.\u00a0 Here's some of my own: 0) This draft boils down to this paragraph if I'm not mistaken: \u00a0  A ROLL protocol MUST be made flexible by a design that offers the \u00a0  configuration facility so that the user (network administrator) can \u00a0  choose the security settings that match the application's needs. \u00a0  Furthermore, in the case of LLNs, that flexibility SHOULD extend to \u00a0  allowing the routing protocol security requirements to be met by \u00a0  measures applied at different protocol layers, provided the \u00a0  identified requirements are collectively met. I'm absolutely fine with the first sentence.\u00a0 I'm even okay with the second sentence it gets done at the application layer all the time, but at the application layer they can all point to something that's all specified up and has MTI etc (think TLS).\u00a0 If we end up doing that here then something similar needs to end up happening.\u00a0 If use cases are so broad that they can't possibly pick an underlying security mechanism then you need to try again but with a\u00a0 smaller net. 1) s3.2: Adding \"misuse\" in the integrity strikes me as wrong.\u00a0 It's about determining whether data has changed.\u00a0 The examples used are about delayed or replayed messages which seem to be better characterized as availability. 2) s3.2: How on is non-repudiation going to apply to these tiny little assets?\u00a0 I see how I, a person, can repudiate that I sent a message and I can see how you, as a person, can repudiate something else.\u00a0 Are two nodes going to be claiming one sent something while the other will say no I didn't?\u00a0 I hear all the time we can't do this and we can't do that because these are so constrained but you're going to log and capture on-going messages - color me confused?\u00a0 I think you should say non-repudiation applies to people not to device-to-device/automated communications. 4) s3.4: Not this one is likely to be cleared after an email exchange or two because there's not much for the authors to do\u2026 This made my head pop because I thought the only security defined in the  RFC 6550  has confidentiality baked in.\u00a0 So are we dumping the security solution in rpl?    With regard to confidentiality, protecting  the routing/topology information from eavesdropping or unauthorized  exposure may be desirable in certain cases but is in itself less  pertinent in general to the routing function.",
