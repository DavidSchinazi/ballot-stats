I understand that this has been a large archaeological undertaking, and that the relatively small size of the document belies the large amount of actual work that went into it. I have one top-level concern about the registry, a handful of proposed corrections to the initial table, and some very minor editorial nits. I present the following feedback in that order. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have some very strong concerns about the handling for the \"URI\" RRTYPE. As far as I can tell, the entries in the initial table were formed by starting with the entries in https://www.iana.org/assignments/enum-services/enum-services.xhtml , adding the most popular entries from https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml , (\"dccp\", \"sctp\", \"tcp\", and \"udp\") and removing \"web\". Please note that it is entirely possible that I've missed an important detail here, and am merely confused. My top-line concern is that, while the table established by this document appears to intend to be a strict superset of the Enumservices table, there are no instructions of any kind to the IANA that would result in these tables remaining in sync -- that is, when a new service is added to the \"Enumservice Registrations\" table, one might presume that it needs to also appear in the new registry established by this document. I would imagine this could be handled either by asking the IANA to add instructions to the \"Enumservice Registrations\" table indicating that a corresponding entry must be added to this one; or simply by including the contents of that table by reference rather than by value into this one. I'm pretty agnostic about which approach is taken.",
