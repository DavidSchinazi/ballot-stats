(And I don't see any real use of the client identifier in section 8.) So requiring the client identifier seems like something counter to data minimisation. Requiring that also seems to conflict with possible future privacy friendly dhcp profiles, which might want to use this as e.g. with some cleverness in source port randomisation, the public Internet might get less trackable evidence than would otherwise be the case. I'd argue that you might be better off here to make the client identifier a SHOULD NOT and to point out that including it may break a privacy friendly profile such as defined in [1] should that end up being standardised, which is presumably likely now that [1] is a dhc wg draft (though note that I'm not sure the treatment of client identifier in [1]-02 is what'll end up there in the end.) \u00a0  [1]  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dhc-anonymity-profile-00",
