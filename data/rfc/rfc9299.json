        "text": "Thank you for this document. It is really helpful to have a clear introduction to LISP, and I appreciate the hard work that has gone into producing this text. I have a small Discuss that is easily fixed. The essence is that you  should limit this document to a description of LISP and not try to use it to bash other solutions. In Section 4.2 \u00a0  On the contrary BGP is a \u00a0  push architecture, where the required network state is pushed by \u00a0  means of BGP UPDATE messages to BGP speakers. You will be aware of  RFC 5291  and the use of ORF to make BGP a pull-mode protocol. (I won't say to you that LISP is push mode because a Map-Reply pushes  the mapping information from the map server to the client :-) So, my advice is to describe LISP in this document and to not make comments about other systems. It isn't a beauty contest and it isn't wise to try to say \"my system is better/different from yours\". The solution is to just remove this sentence. Similarly in 7.1 \u00a0  BGP is the standard protocol to implement inter-domain routing.\u00a0 With \u00a0  BGP, routing information are propagated along the network and each \u00a0  autonomous system can implement its own routing policy that will \u00a0  influence the way routing information are propagated.\u00a0 The direct \u00a0  consequence is that an autonomous system cannot precisely control the \u00a0  way the traffic will enter the network. \u00a0  As opposed to BGP, a LISP site can strictly impose via which ETRs the \u00a0  traffic must enter the the LISP site network even though the path \u00a0  followed to reach the ETR is not under the control of the LISP site. Let's not get into the \"BGP this, BGP that\" debate. Just remove the  first paragraph and the first four words of the second paragraph. That way you avoid all contention and write a document about LISP.",

There are presumably security considerations sections in the other documents, including one that focuses entirely on security, so it is not necessary that all security issues be brought up here. That said, I think that if you were to write an \"introduction to security considerations\", there are more important ones than the DoS threat. in particular, as a routing protocol care must be taken to make sure a bad actor cannot attract someone else's traffic with mechanisms like those we are trying to address with BGP security. Much of the routing information is maintained in a database \"like DNS\". If it *were* DNS, DNSSEC could be used to address the integrity issues. If it is home grown, some equivalent mechanism will be necessary.\u00a0 Why not use DNS?",
