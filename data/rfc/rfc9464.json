Depending on the use of this payload, it has a different field construction. That is, we have two different kinds of ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO, which would make defining this field (eg in C headers or in a class object) impossible without splitting it into two different names and definitions. Either all the fields must be identical, with optional 0 lengths field omitted, or the draft should define ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO_REQUEST and ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO_RESPONSE with their different field types. This can be further seen by the difficulty to read the examples in the appendici with the ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO() syntax. If one ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO type is used, I think the syntax for both request and response should be:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+ |R|\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Attribute Type\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Length\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | +-+-----------------------------+---------------+---------------+ | Num Hash Algs |\u00a0 ADN Length\u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | +---------------+---------------+\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  + ~\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Authentication Domain Name\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ~ +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ | Digest Hash Alg Identifier\u00a0 \u00a0 |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ~ +-------------------------------+\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  + ~\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Certificate Digest\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ~ +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+ (eg as the current \"response\" version) And Num Hash Algs, ADN Length and Digest Hash Alg Identifier are mandatory fields in both the request and the response. I would also always list these 3 fields in the presentation format of ENCDNS_DIGEST_INFO() as used in the appendici examples. I would rename \"Hash Alg Identifier\" to \"Digest Hash Alg Identifier\" to make it more obvious that is what the hash algorithm is for. #2 Updates  RFC 8598 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Note: [ RFC8598 ] requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 attribute to be mandatory present when INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 included. This specification relaxes that constraint This clearly updates  RFC8598 , but the document is lacking an Update: clause. Please add the Update clause and mention the update in the abstract/introduction. #3 Security Considerations \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The initiator may trust the encrypted DNS resolvers supplied by \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 means of IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 provided DNS resolvers, especially in the case of connecting \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to unknown or untrusted networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 networks). This does not seem to be a \"Security Consideration\". Also, before this draft, receiving an (unencrypted) DNS server supplied by IKEv2 would also be more trusted. In general, VPN clients trust the \"VPN provided nameserver\" more than the local network one, irrespective of transport encryption. Perhaps this sentence can just be deleted? #4 Appendix A.2 and A.3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 encrypted tunnel. What is \"legacy\" about this? I do not understand the point that A.2 is trying to make?  Similarly, I don't understand Appendix A.3. The VPN service is not involved in \"allowing\" an application to send traffic through the tunnel. It is the VPN client that decided whether or not to send its traffic through the tunnel or not. Also VPNs typically are configured to be either split-tunnel or not. This can be, be hardly ever is, dynamic. I don't understand what A.3 is trying to convey as example use related to the encrypted dns capability of the document.",
