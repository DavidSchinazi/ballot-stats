I think that both should be easy to address...  1: \"While most of the routers perform load balancing on flows using Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP), a few still divide the workload through packet-based techniques.\u00a0 The former scenario is defined according to [ RFC2991 ], while the latter generates a round-robin scheme to deliver every new outgoing packet.\u00a0 ECMP uses a hashing function to ensure that every packet of a flow is delivered by the same path, and this avoids increasing the packet delay variation and possibly producing overwhelming packet reordering in TCP flows.\" Round-robin / \"per packet\" is a form ECMP, and  RFC2991  doesn't \"define\" just the former, it explains both, and recommends the flow based /\u00a0 hashed approach.  RFC 2991  describes a number of approaches (e.g Modulo-N Hash, Hash-Threshold, Highest Random Weight (HRW)) and makes some good suggestions, but the text as written isn't correct. 2: \"In IPv6, it is sufficient to be routed identically if the IP source and destination addresses and the FlowLabel are constant, see [ RFC6437 ].\" Many routers currently ignore the FlowLabel and use other header info, like port-numbers. The sentence might(?) be true in an idealized network, but in the real world isn't. Some additional text should solve this...",
