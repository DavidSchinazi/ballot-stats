This document should then also be stripped of all text discussing the \"fixed number of packets\" approach, to improve clarity. (You could move it to a non-normative appendix, if there is a desire to keep the text around.) ### Section 3.1, paragraph 16 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  Two different strategies that can be used when implementing the \u00a0 \u00a0  method: ``` If both of these strategies are part of the standard, concrete guidance needs to be given when to use one or the other. The text below about \"a limited number of traffic flows\") is too unspecific. ### Section 3.2, paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  The same principle used to measure packet loss can be applied also to \u00a0 \u00a0  one-way delay measurement.\u00a0 There are three alternatives, as \u00a0 \u00a0  described hereinafter. ``` As above, there is a lot of discussion text around these alternatives, but no concrete guidance when one SHOULD be used but not the other two. If that guidance cannot be given, I wonder if we have enough deployment experience to lift this to the Standards Track. ### Section 5, paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  This document introduces two color-switching methods: one is based on \u00a0 \u00a0  a fixed number of packets, and the other is based on a fixed timer. \u00a0 \u00a0  But the method based on a fixed timer is preferable because it is \u00a0 \u00a0  more deterministic, and it is considered in the document. ``` Section 3.1 says that the fixed-number-based approach is out of scope for this specification. The text above is inconsistent with that. Again, please remove the text that talks about the option that is not actually part of the intended standard (or move it to an appendix.)",

A controlled domain is a managed network that selects, monitors, and controls access by enforcing policies at the domain boundaries, in order to discard undesired external packets entering the domain and check internal packets leaving the domain. [...] It must be possible to control the domain boundaries, and use specific precautions if traffic traverses the Internet.\" \"Controlled domain\" isn't a magic incantation you invoke to make all security issues disappear. Your definition of controlled domain sounds suspiciously like \"the network should magically stop bad packets, and evil people wanting to do bad things!!!!\".  RFC8799  does not define what makes a domain, nor how the boundary is protected. Instead, it \"it shows the need for a precise definition of \"limited domain membership\" and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary nodes.\" and notes that \"the Internet does not have a well-defined concept of limited domains\" and further that \"Domain boundaries that are defined administratively (e.g., by address filtering rules in routers) are prone to leakage caused by human error, especially if the limited domain traffic appears otherwise normal to the boundary routers.\u00a0 In this case, the network operator needs to take active steps to protect the boundary.\" The document states that \"For security reasons, the Alternate Marking Method is RECOMMENDED only for controlled domains.\" - but you have not defined how a network operator is expected to define and enforce the domain boundary; simply saying that the network should select, monitor, and control access by enforcing policies at the domain boundaries, in order to discard undesired external packets doesn't explain how the network should do this. How exactly does the network know what packets are marked? How does the operator filter these?
