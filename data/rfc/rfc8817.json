Additionally, I am not sure that there's quite enough here to be interoperably implementable.\u00a0 Specifically, we seem to be lacking a description of how an encoder or decoder knows which TSVCIS parameters, and in what order, to byte-pack or unpack, respectively.\u00a0 One might surmise that there is a canonical listing in [TSVCIS], but this document does not say that, and furthermore [TSVCIS] is only listed as an informative reference.\u00a0 (I couldn't get my hands on my copy, at least on short notice.)\u00a0 If we limited ourselves to treating the TSVCIS parameters as an entirely opaque blob (codec, convey these N octets to the peer with the appropriate one- or two-byte trailer for payload type identification and framing), that would be interoperably implementable, since the black-box bits are up to some other codec to interpret. In a similar vein, we mention but do not completely specify the potential for using CODB as an end-to-end framing bit, in Section 3.1 (see Comment), which is not interoperably implementable without further details.",
