However, their work is predicated on geopriv being a sound idea - i.e. an LIS being something that an application trusts to know where its hosting device is, and that a user will have the clue/knobs to disable the feature if they want to. The current climate suggests both that users lack this clue and that applications may do stuff without telling the user. Furthermore, we can be relatively certain that an LIS operator cannot be trusted if for no other reason than they be served with an instrument of local law. It does not seem reasonable (within the scope of criteria for Discusses) for me to continue to push this point as one requiring resolution in this document even though I continue to believe that the mechanism introduced here will expose users who were previously (unknown to them) protected by home gateways. There has been some discussion that the geopriv working group might start to actively work on a location discovery process that can be used and still preserve the user's privacy, But absent that, I cannot in all conscience support the publication of this work.\u00a0 I will therefore Abstain.",

From the secdir review: The authors mention that  RFC 5986  is the preferred method whenever it is supported.\u00a0 I believe that this is because it is more accurate.\u00a0 First question: am I correct in believing this?\u00a0 Secondly, is there any way an attacker could a) cause a device to identify the wrong domain name and b) if a device identifies an incorrect domain name (whether or not the attacker can cause this to happen) is there anyway an attacker can exploit that? Question 2a) may be difficult to answer because the draft does not mandate any particular solution. Indeed it cannot, because the solution used will depend on what is supported locally.\u00a0 But if the answers to questions 1 and\u00a0 2b) are \"yes\" it might be worthwhile to point this out in the security considerations section as an additional reason to use the solution\u00a0 given in\u00a0  RFC5389  whenever it is available.",
