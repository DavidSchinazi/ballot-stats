Before I ballot yes on this one, there are two things I'd like to check (and a bunch of  non-blocking comments about which I'm also happy to chat): (1) 4.2: Why didn't you just mandate one way of calculating a fingerprint as being mandatory to implement? (E.g. a sha256 hash of the DER encoded SPKI?) and why is the \"don't pin to a CA\" rule in appendix A not a MUST in the body of the document? Wouldn't it be better to do both of those? (Or to say why you're not doing them, e.g. if current implementations do different things.) Given that recursives publishing PINs will pick something, having that something supported by all clients would seem like a fine thing. (2) Section 5: Is it ok to (almost:-) recommend TLS false start like that?\u00a0 Don't you need to at least point out that that has additional requirements over and above  RFC7525 ? I've not checked those in detail though, as I'm waiting for the TLS WG to do their publication request for false start. If you've done that checking, then you might be just able to say \"yeah, that's not a problem\" but I'd like to know since implementers here are likely to read this as saying \"Do  RFC7525  and you're good.\"",
