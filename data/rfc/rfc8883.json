In light of the updated usage described in Section 2.2, should we direct IANA to make the \"Reference\" column for the \"unrecognized Next Header type encountered\" parameter problem list both this document and  RFC 4443 ?\u00a0 (It currently does not list any reference, as is the case for many entries on the containing page...)
