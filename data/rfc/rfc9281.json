In \u00a73.11 regarding ISOC, we have \u00a0  Internet standardization is an organized activity of the Internet \u00a0  Society (ISOC), with the Board of Trustees being responsible for \u00a0  ratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet standards process \u00a0  [ISOCIETF]. Looking at ISOCIETF, I don\u2019t see this in plain language anywhere. The strings \u201crules\u201d and \u201cratify\u201d don\u2019t appear, and \u201cprocedure\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere relevant. The primary relevant section is \u00a74, \u201cISOC's Role in the IETF Standards Process\u201d, which lists several specifics in the first paragraph: \u00a0  ISOC plays a small role in the IETF standards process.\u00a0 In \u00a0  particular, ISOC assists the standards process by appointing the IETF \u00a0  NomCom chair and by confirming IAB candidates who are put forward by \u00a0  the IETF NomCom, as described in [ RFC8713 ], and by acting as the last \u00a0  resort in the appeals process, as described in [ RFC2026 ]. There are also indirect things mentioned later (liaisons, indirect support programs). But none of these things seem to rise to the level of \u201cratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet standards process.\u201d We also have, in \u00a76 of ISOCIETF, some words about the IETF Trust, ending in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One of the IETF \u00a0  Trust's trustees is appointed by the ISOC's Board of Trustees. This, again, doesn\u2019t seem to rise to the level of \u201cratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet standards process.\u201d",

If the answer is (3), there ought to be an ISE section and a sentence about the IAB stream.

I have 2 issues, one is editorial, but sufficiently important that it reaches DISCUSS level.  The document uses the singular Editor and Author (and similar) -- it does says: \"This document refers to individual roles in the singular, such as \"a Document Editor.\" and then mentions that \"many roles are filled by more than one person at the same time\" with a reasonable justification for this. I'd like to DISCUSS this decision -- I've very concerned that newcomers to the process (and outsiders) will search for things like \"IETF author\" or \"editor\" or similar (e.g Chair), and only read the descriptions, not the terminology / disclaimer at the top. Again, I understand that this was done for clarity, but suspect that the audience was for the IETF community, and the potential for confusion by outsiders and newcomers was not considered. I think that the (much messier) \"The Document Editor(s) or Author(s)\" or \"The Document Editors or Authors\" or similar. In addition, a related issue is: \"When a document is composed and edited mainly by an individual, they may be referred to as the Document Author.\" This very strongly implies (or even states) that, if there is more than one person writing this, then they are not authors / that you cannot have more than one person being referred to as Document Authors. This certainly doesn't agree with my understanding.",
