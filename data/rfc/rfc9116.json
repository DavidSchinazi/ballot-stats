        "text": "I have a few issues I\u2019d like to get resolve before I move to \u201cno objection\u201d.\u00a0 I think it will be an easy discussion and quick resolution. \u2014 Section 3.1 \u2014 \u00a0  A \"security.txt\" file that is found in a file system MUST only apply \u00a0  to the folder in which it is located and that folder's subfolders. \u00a0  The file does not apply to any of the folder's parent or sibling \u00a0  folders. You don\u2019t say what happens if there are nested security.txt files.\u00a0 What\u2019s the scope in this situation (which file applies to folder1; which applies to folder1/subfolder)?: /example/security.txt /example/folder1/ /example/folder1/security.txt /example/folder1/subfolder/ I think the document needs to make this clear. \u00a0  # This security.txt file applies to IPv4 address of 192.0.2.0. \u00a0  https://192.0.2.0/.well-known/security.txt I\u2019m uncomfortable with trying to restrict the scope depending upon how the file was retrieved.\u00a0 If  www.example.com  resolves to 192.0.2.0, then it should not matter whether the file is retrieved via\u00a0 or\u00a0 (or via the corresponding v6 address). \u2014 Section 3.6 \u2014 Your examples lack the EXPIRES field that you say MUST be present. \u2014 Section 5 \u2014 \u00a0  The expected file format of the security.txt file is plain text (MIME \u00a0  type \"text/plain\") as defined in section 4.1.3 of [ RFC2046 ] and is \u00a0  encoded using UTF-8 [ RFC3629 ] in Net-Unicode form [ RFC5198 ]. In Section 3 you say that for HTTP: \u00a0  It MUST have a Content-Type of \"text/plain\" with the \u00a0  default charset parameter set to \"utf-8\" (as per section 4.1.3 of \u00a0  [ RFC2046 ]). It would be best to have the format requirement be consistent, however it\u2019s retrieved, so \u201cMUST\u201d (rather than \u201cexpected\u201d) is right, no? The ABNF needs some work.\u00a0 DISCUSS-level issues here, with less important ones below: \u00a0 signed\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  =\u00a0 sign-header unsigned sign-footer No, the signed body doesn\u2019t just have a header and footer around the unsigned plain text.\u00a0 A signed body would have an unsigned body, *followed by* a sign-header, a signature, and a sign-footer. \u00a0 unsigned\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  =\u00a0 *line (contact-field eol) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *line (expires-field eol) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *line [lang-field eol] *line \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ; order of fields within the file is not important I found this confusing, with \u201c*line\u201d repeated all over the place and with \u201ccontact-field\u201d both here and in the \u201cfield\u201d construct, but as I worked it out I see that it\u2019s correct (though defnitely confusing).\u00a0 But while the order of the fields mostly doesn\u2019t matter, the order of the Contact fields, if there are more than one, does matter.\u00a0 So you\u2019ll have to tweak this a bit.

        "text": "Hi, Thank you for this document.\u00a0 I like that it provides a fairly simple solution to providing vulnerability reporting information, although I also have some sympathy with the observation that if the server is compromised then security.txt could also be compromised. However, I have a concern about the document both being machine readable and also including an expiry date.\u00a0 This would seem to offer an easy mechanism to probe websites for those that have out of date security.txt files and hence may have more lax security practices, or potentially help provide indirect information about what software versions a website might be using.\u00a0 Alternatively, this will end up as Barry has suggested, with lots of old expiry dates. Arguably, the best alternative might be just to not provide a date at all, and rely on the humans to check the provenance of the information, and treat it with suitable caution.\u00a0 An alternative possibility could be just to define a field for when the information was last updated.\u00a0 This doesn't go out of date, but helps provide some clue as to whether the information might be stale or not.
