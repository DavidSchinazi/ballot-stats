For example, I don't understand how one might (interoperably) do RBAC or other \"advanced\" security mechanisms that are promised in other CLUE documents. [1] Even worse, I don't get how one could e.g. use XMLENC to encrypt parts of the schema here, as that'd (I think) almost certainty have to have been considered in the design of this schema, but there's no evidence of that. That seems to end up meaning that the only security mechanisms that one can use with CLUE and for which one can currently achieve interop are transport security mechanisms. That all seems to conflict with text in the security consideration of the CLUE protocol draft. So my question to discuss is: other than transport security, what interoperable security mechanisms are expected to be defined in CLUE, and where might I find descriptions of those?",
