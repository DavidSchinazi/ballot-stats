(2) the destination address of the IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel used for flows from a ~Raf to a ~Raf -- Section 6.3.4 says addressed to the ~Raf, but Figure 7 says \"hop\" (3) Table 14 says \"(opt: RPI)\" which, though not defined, I take to mean as indicating that the insertion of the RPI is optional, but the body text in Section 7.1.2 is unconditional that the 6LBR inserts an RPI header (4) Section 7.2.1 does not mention adding v6-in-v6 encapsulation, but Figure 8 has a \"must\" in that column. (5) Section 7.3.1 only has descriptive text that \"[t]he originating node should put the RPI into an IPv6-in-IPv6 header\", but Figure 8 lists this behavior as \"must\" (though there would also be a second v6-in-v6 encapsulationi from root to destination, which is clearly a must). (Note that Section 7.3.2 covers essentially the same flow, but uses \"which must be in an IPv6-in-IPv6 header addressed to the root\".) (6) In Section 5, we say that the DODAG root \"SHOULD force [rank information] to zero\" but then that \"[t]he Internet will therefore not see any SenderRank information\", and a SHOULD-level requirement is not enough to guarantee this statement as fact. Additionally, there are some terminology inconsistencies in Figures 7 and 8 that need to be cleaned up or explained.\u00a0 For example, in Figure 7, what is the difference between \"Yes\" and \"must\" in the \"IPv6-in-IPv6\" column, and in the \"v6-in-v6 dst\" column, what does \"root\" mean? In Figure 8, what does \"Opt\" mean in the \"RPI\" column?",

At first sight, with the new  RFC8200  HbH handling, there is no need to change the RPI code from 0x63 as most routers will ignore HbH anyway. 2) the document deserves a better text as there are too many nits, unexpanded acronyms, ... the reader has hard time to understand the document.
