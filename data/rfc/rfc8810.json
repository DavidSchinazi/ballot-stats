In section 3 the following statement is done:  \u00a0  Note: a separate \"owner\" column is not provided because the owner of \u00a0  all registrations, once made, is \"IESG\". First of all, just because something is under IETF Review policy does not imply that change control of a registration entry is owned by IETF. It might be true that all current entries are established through IETF stream specifications, where it make sense that change control is owned by IETF. So I would recommend that you reformulate the note.  Secondly, the IESG has discussed this and are currently of the opinion that registrations done by IETF documents should be \"owned\" by IETF. We are in the process of establishing an IETF consensus on this. There is currently a draft on this:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-leiba-ietf-iana-registrations/   Reasons for this are several, consistency to intended state, making it clear that it is the IETF that owns IETF specification based registry entries, not created management bodies, thirdly one can replace the IESG with soemthing else without having to update all these registries.

There is currently a draft on this:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-leiba-ietf-iana-registrations/   Reasons for this are several, consistency to intended state, making it clear that it is the IETF that owns IETF specification based registry entries, not created management bodies, thirdly one can replace the IESG with soemthing else without having to update all these registries.  Section 3.  Looking at the table. I see no explanation in this document to these entries. Still you want to add them with this document as reference. Can you please add an explanation behind the values being registered in the below table?  \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  | Value | Description\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | Reference /\u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | Change\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | Controller\u00a0  | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 128\u00a0 | Prestandard Route Refresh (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0  | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 129\u00a0 | Prestandard Outbound Route Filtering\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (deprecated),\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 prestandard Routing\u00a0  | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | Policy Distribution (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 130\u00a0 | Prestandard Outbound Route Filtering\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 131\u00a0 | Prestandard Multisession (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 184\u00a0 | Prestandard FQDN (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 185\u00a0 | Prestandard OPERATIONAL message\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (deprecated)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+ \u00a0  |\u00a0 255\u00a0 | Reserved\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  | (this\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | document)\u00a0 \u00a0 | \u00a0  +-------+--------------------------------------------+--------------+",
