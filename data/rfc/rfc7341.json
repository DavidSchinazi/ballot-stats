Here's how I understand the protocol flow from what I read in the document: - If the client can use DHCPv4 directly, it does, and also uses DHCPv6.\u00a0 The protocol described here is not involved. - If the client can not use DHCPv4 directly, it uses DHCPv6.\u00a0 It includes the 4o6 Server Address option in its request. - If the server does not respond with the 4o6 Server Address option, we just have plain DHCPv6, and the protocol described here is not involved any further. - If the server does respond with the 4o6 Server Address option, the client uses the protocol described here, sending a DHCPv4-query and getting a DHCPv4-response. Is this correct?\u00a0 If not, what is the correct flow description? Does it make sense to include something like this in the document (this text, or a correct version)?\u00a0 A flow diagram?\u00a0 Both?\u00a0 Neither?

Section 8 starts with: \u00a0  The DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 function MUST be disabled by default.\u00a0 The \u00a0  client MUST obtain the necessary IPv6 configuration (stateless or \u00a0  stateful) before using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6.\u00a0 The client intending to \u00a0  use DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 MUST request the 4o6 Server Address option \u00a0  using Option Request option (ORO) in every Solicit, Request, Renew, \u00a0  Rebind and Information-request message. I have two questions about this text. 1. It seems illogical to say the 4o6 function must be disabled, yet the client must request the 4o6 server address option.\u00a0 That certainly sounds like the functionality is enabled.\u00a0 What is really meant by that first sentence? 2. How does the client know to include the 4o6 server address option?\u00a0 Is it triggered by the failure of DHCPv4 to receive configuration data?\u00a0 In other words, what bootstraps the insertion of this option?\u00a0 If it is a failure to receive a DHCPv4 response, shouldn't that be pointed out?",
