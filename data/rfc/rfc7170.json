        "text": "I'm going to raise Spencer's comment to a DISCUSS: I find the version negotiation in Section 3.1 to be somewhat confusingly written.\u00a0 Possibly it will be implemented correctly because people generally know how to code version negotiation -- but I don't think the text here makes it clear. First, you seem to be using \"EAP peer\" and \"TEAP peer\" interchangably.\u00a0 Please make sure you're consistent in your usage, and if there really is a difference then make that clear and explain it.\u00a0 You similarly say \"EAP server\" and \"TEAP server\" -- again, are they the same, or different enities? Second, I'm confused by \"server\" and \"peer\".\u00a0 Peers talk with peers; when there's a server, there's a client.\u00a0 What does it mean to have a server and a peer (in the document in general, and in this negotiation in particular)? Now, I think you're trying to say this: 1. The server gives the highest version it supports. 2. The client does one of three things: 2a. Sends a response that echos the server's version. 2b. Sends a response that offers a lower version. 2c. Sends a Nak, and we're done here (perhaps we continue with something else). 3. For 2b, the server does one of two things: 3a. Accepts the client's version and continues. 3b. [Does something else; see Spencer's comment.] Now, I like this approach, in that both the client and server can refuse an earlier version (which perhaps has security flaws), so that's nice.\u00a0 But I think the wording of the negotiation process ought to be fixed to make it clearer, and that what happens in case 3b, especially, needs to be clearer. I also think that numbering the list(s) will help, though you don't have to use my numbering (and if you can make it clear without numbers, that's fine).",

You might also want to warn here (or somewhere) about names that contain a null byte in case that attack is used e.g. with a TLS server cert subject name like \"CN= www.paypal.com \\ 0.badguy.com \" Even though that's really a PKI failure, not detecting it here would be bad too.
