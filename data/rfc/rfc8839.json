        "text": "This is a fine document and I only found a few minor things that should be easy to fix. Thank you for addressing my comments. Unfortunately it doesn't look like my DISCUSS point was addressed yet. Also, your IANA change introduced another issue. 1) In 5.1: \u00a0  The candidate attribute can itself be extended.\u00a0 The grammar allows \u00a0  for new name/value pairs to be added at the end of the attribute. \u00a0  Such extensions MUST be made through IETF Review or IESG Approval \u00a0  [ RFC8126 ] and the assignments MUST contain the specific extension and \u00a0  a reference to the document defining the usage of the extension. This is effectively creating a new registry, but this information is not present in the IANA Considerations section. So you need to do one of the following: a) Remove the last sentence b) Reword it to only talk about IETF stream documents for defining extensions (IESG can't really do what you ask, unless you have an IANA registry established for these.) c) Move this text to the IANA considerations and update it to properly define a new IANA registry. 2) In 10.2: You removed the following text: \u00a0  o\u00a0 Name, Email, and Address of a contact person for the registration\t \t\t   \u00a0  o\u00a0 Organization or individuals having the change control I think removing (postal) Address is a good thing. However the rest of this is still needed, as IANA uses this information to decide whether a person/organization is allowed to update an existing registry entry. So please consider adding it back or explain why this information is not needed for a registry where external organizations can add value (without publishing an RFC).",

Why does this specification then need to additionally normatively recommend the use of ICE for dual-stack scenarios?
