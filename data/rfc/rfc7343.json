There is no minimum requirement for preserving bits or mention of the space left for these bits (that I could find and maybe they are somewhere else?). The current guidance is in  RFC2104  and says to is to truncate no less than half of the length of the hash output.\u00a0  Is there space for more than half?\u00a0 If so, this guidance should be included, if not, a warning that it is not possible would be helpful.",
