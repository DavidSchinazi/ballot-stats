        "text": "(1) Section 8.6 seems to have some conflicting requirements.\u00a0 The filtered property map response \"MUST include all the inherited property values for the requested entities and all the entities which are able to inherit property values from the requested entities.\"\u00a0 We then go on to say that to do this, the server MAY follow three rules, that themselves include SHOULD-level guidance, but don't say how the MUST is achieved if the SHOULDs or MAY are ignored.\u00a0 I was expecting to see a construction of the form \"SHOULD do X, but if not, MUST do Y\". (2) Many of the examples in Sections 10.X do not seem to match up with the prose that describes them and the previous data tables that they are intended to illustrate (see COMMENT).\u00a0 We should make sure that the examples are internally consistent. (3) Section 4.6.2 says: \u00a0  *\u00a0 Last, the entity domain types \"asn\" and \"countrycode\" defined in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [ I-D.ietf-alto-cdni-request-routing-alto ] do not have a defining \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 information resource.\u00a0 Indeed, the entity identifiers in these two \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 entity domain types are already standardized in documents that the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Client can use. But earlier we said that \"the defining information resource of a resource-specific entity domain D is unique\", but this seems to be saying that the defining information resource of domains of the \"asn\" and \"contrycode\" type are *not* unique, by virtue of not existing at all.\u00a0 How can we rectify these two statements?",
