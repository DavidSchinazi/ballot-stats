        "text": "I've put in a DISCUSS because I think the point I raise below warrants further discussion, unless the WG already discussed it and concluded otherwise. Section 7 says: \"However, when combining both IPv6 privacy extensions and a unique \u00a0  IPv6 Prefix per Host a reduced privacy experience for the subscriber \u00a0  is introduced, because a prefix may be associated with a subscriber, \u00a0  even when the subscriber implemented IPv6 privacy extensions  RFC4941 \u00a0  [ RFC4941 ].\" If an operator assigns the same unique prefix to the same host every time the host connects to the network, the unlinkability benefits of using IPv6 privacy extensions are completely negated. It seems reasonable to me for this document to normatively RECOMMEND that operators assign a different unique prefix to a returning host for the purpose of limiting linkability to the lifetime of the host's connection to the network. I'm sure there are exception cases where this wouldn't make sense, and some examples of those could be given. But by default this seems to me like a reasonable recommendation to mitigate the privacy risk introduced by the unique prefix, while the attacks described in Section 1 would also still be mitigated. Did the WG discuss this?",
