From a purely process perpective, this would either require an update to 5766, or it would require an argument that the local/access network is somehow equally protected. I think the latter would only be true if the access network has some sort of protection beyond just being the access network (e.g. a vpn, ipsec, or physical isolation.)\u00a0 I don't recall seeing text that suggested any of those. But in any case, I think relaxing that requirement needs some discussion about how the server or client can be sure that all communication is in fact constrained to the local network.",
