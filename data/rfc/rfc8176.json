(The issue is whether as per  RFC 5226  one sends a request to a DE and he or she may send it to mailing list, or if IANA should send the request directly to a mailing list. But I think the language in  draft-leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis  is looser on this respect, as it probably should be.)",

RFC4949  does not tell anyone how to achieve interop with \"fpt\" (nor any of the other cases where you refer to 4949 I think). There is therefore no utility in \"defining\" \"fpt\" as it will not achieve interop and in fact is more likely to cause confusion than interop. If the solution of actually defining the meaning of things like \"fpt\" is not achievable then perhaps it will be better to only define those for which we can get interop (\"pwd\" and one or two others) and leave the definition of the rest for later. (In saying that I do recall that one of the authors said that there are implementations that use some of these  type-names, but the point of RFCs is not to \"bless\" such things, but to achieve interop.) The version of the same point I made on the  previous revision of this draft is below, but IMO still applies. This specification seems to me to break it's own rules. You state that registrations should include a reference to a specification to improve interop. And yet, for the strings added here (e.g. otp) you don't do that (referring to section 2 will not improve interop) and there are different ways in which many of the methods in section 2 can be done.
