Specifically, when Section 3.5 says to \"[repeat] the actions described in Section 3.4, starting at step 4\" that seems to (for long-lived PIOs) result in, e.g., the new temporary address having lifetime TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME starting at exactly the time when the previous one expired; wouldn't an observer be able to trivially correlate \"new address showed up with TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME\" with \"address that expired at that time\"?\u00a0 Note that the attacker does not need to know the value of TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME in order to perform a DFT on the distribution of \"new address\" events.\u00a0 (Furthermore, we apparently qualify the \"repeating the actions\" with some caveats, which doesn't exactly qualify as \"repeating the actions\" anymore.\u00a0 That said, the caveats currently listed in Section 3.5 don't seem to be enough to provide the \"statistically different property\" in what I believe to be the intended interpretation.) (2) Please fix the reference for DupAddrDetectTransmits in Section 3.8 -- it is defined in 4862, while RetransTimer is in 4861. (3)  RFC 4941  cannot be a *normative* reference of this document if we are going to Obsolete it.",
