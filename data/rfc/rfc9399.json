        "text": "Don't Panic! As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion... I'm assuming that I'm missing something really obvious here, but this *feels* like a bad idea to me... The document says: \"The use of logotypes will, in many cases, affect the users decision to trust and use a certificate.\" Yes, but that seems like a bad outcome... Random things on the Internet tell me that Microsoft has a well recognized logo. Seems plausible, let's use that as an example. When a user is trying to figure out if a certificate actually belongs to Microsoft they are likely to go \"Oh, yes, it's a square composed of other colored squares, this must really be Microsoft\", even if the CN is for  www.evil-attackers-r-us.net . Even without an attacker intentionally creating visually confusing logos, many are similar - for example,  https://icn.bg/  looks really similar to Microsoft's logo (and many things look very similar to the Pepsi logo -  https://yourmileagemayvary.net/2021/05/23/look-up-in-the-sky-its-a-coke-plane-its-a-pepsi-plane-its/  ). Here is an image with two logos:  https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hD95PaJgx5ZZVCFduTWhtg-1200-80.jpg.webp  One of these is for airbnb, and one is for a Japanese drive-in. Keeping in mind that, as a user, the logotype is likely to affect your decision to trust and use the cert, when entering your credit-card info to book your next vacation rental, do you know which of these you should expect? If you get the drive-in one, would you really recognize that? The document uses VISA and MasterCard as examples, but, without looking in your wallet to actually confirm what their logos look like, are you *sure* that you would be able to unambiguously identify them if placed next to logos made by an attacker?  Ok, so now that I've had my soapbox rant: This document updates  RFC 3709  and  RFC 6170 , which been around since 2004 and 2011 respectively. Apparently the sky hasn't actually fallen yet, and so I must be missing something. I did spend quite a while trying to find examples using  RFC3709 /RFC6170, so I could figure out what I'm missing, but failed. I *did* find a few CA certs with this, but they just had links to  http://logo.verisign.com/vslogo.gif  (which doesn't resolve). The only \"live\" cert was for  https://www.dtihost.cz/ , but it's not valid. Again, I'm probably missing something obvious, and so clue-bat appreciated...",
