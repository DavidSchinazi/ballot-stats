Section 3 contains R-1 which says that this marking \"needs to be visible to all ConEx-capable nodes on the path.\" Additionally, Section 5 says that the choice of using an IPv6 Destination Option precludes non-ConEx-capable devices from having to deal with the extension header. However,  RFC 2460  clearly says that Destination Options are not inspected by intermediate devices. We all know that a variety of intermediate devices ignore the rule in 2460.\u00a0 Given that, I would like this document to explicitly state that it does not abide by the rule in 2460 so that implementations that do follow 2460 but want to support this approach know to update all their extension header processing code.",

Also, in reading this, I think because of the selected wording, I was thinking that it wasn't clear enough on the need/recommendation for authentication or encryption with IPsec since there are options for both to be set to NULL/none.\u00a0 You can have a NULL cipher-suite and you can also have authentication set to none to allow for opportunistic security negotiations (fairly new RFC for the latter).\u00a0 There's no need to mention these options explicitly, but rather to make it clear that IPsec can be used to provide authentication and encryption.\u00a0 So I think one additional sentence and some possible rewording in this section would be helpful.",
