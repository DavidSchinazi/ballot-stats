This will surely be raised on the telechat. Especially given I still see gaps in the larger picture, such as: \u00a0 \"In this case there is a possibility of setting up some kind of authentication mechanism and submission mechanism \u00a0  that is outside the scope of this document..\" for enabling DNSSEC via CDS/CDNSKEY Can you please promote the first 2 paragraphs of the security considerations section to either the abstract or introduction.
