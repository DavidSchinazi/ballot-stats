        "text": "The scenarios and the solutions in this document strike me as somewhat bogus, and I'd like to hear if the WG had any data on these usage scenarios: - Most VPN installations I know of secure traffic to particular addresses by employing the VPN to do two things: a) Encrypt the traffic, and b) Get through a firewall that prevents traffic not coming through the VPN to never get to the hosts. In that case, if a non-v6 supporting VPN is used, the v6 traffic never even begins, because the traffic simply can't reach the v6 endpoints behind the firewall. Are most VPNs not employed in the way that I describe? - The document seems to assume that VPNs are somehow used to generically encrypt traffic that is not encrypted. But the vulnerability here seems to be the use of the VPN for such purposes. To secure traffic to a service, what you want to do is have the application secure the stream of data in some way (e.g., TLS), not have applications that blindly send clear traffic and then hope it goes through the VPN. Are VPNs actually being used to do this generic blind encryption? Are most of the instances of this not also instances of the firewalled scenario I asked about above? - The document refers to v4 and v6 being \"'tied' together by the DNS\". However, most VPNs I am aware of actually force the use of a particular DNS server on the user of the VPN. In those cases, if the VPN is v4 only, and that DNS is returning v6 addresses, it seems like the appropriate mitigation is to stop returning v6 addresses through that VPN-configured DNS server, not to disable all v6 interfaces. Are most VPNs not using their own configured DNS? - The mitigations in 7.1 never say, \"Fix the VPN software to support v6\", nor does it say, \"stop advertising v6 addresses for things that you expect to go through the VPN\". Those seems like much more sensible mitigations. The choices in the document are \"use v6-enabled VPNs\" or \"don't use v6\". Those seem like lousy choices. The analysis in this document seems very weak to me. I'm not a security guy, but the scenarios and mitigations described in this document don't seem truly representative of VPN usage. At the very least, the document never gives any data indicating that the scenarios are the real problem.",

The response was not impressive. - It seems to me that from Benoit's comments, he is likely an abstention as well. Even though his change in ballot would not make a formal difference to the outcome (it is an Informational document, and therefore a single \"Yes\" is sufficient), perhaps 4 abstentions would give Joel pause. (Perhaps not. ;-) ) If this is a substantive problem with VPN deployments, I would have expected OPSEC to be pushing this as a BCP with specific instructions on how to address the problem and harsh words for broken implementations. But I don't see that motivation or urgency. So I continue to doubt the worth of this document, and I think its continued implication that disabling v6 is a reasonable path forward is a shame.
