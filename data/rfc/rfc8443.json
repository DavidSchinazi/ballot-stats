        "text": "Thanks for this work. I plan to ballot \"yes\", but I have a couple of points I think need to be discussed first. \u00a74.2: \" If the signature validation fails, the verification service should infer \u00a0  that the calling party is not authorized for \u2019Resource-Priority\u2019 as \u00a0  indicated in the claim.\u00a0 In such cases, the priority treatment for \u00a0  the associated communication service is handled as per the local \u00a0  policy.\" I suspect there will be deployments where the node making these local policy decisions is downstream from the verifier. How do they know RPH verification failed? Should the verifier strip resource priority header fields for which validation failed? \u00a77.2:  \u00a0  o\u00a0 The verification of the signature MUST include means of verifying \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that the signer is authoritative for the signed content of the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 resource priority namespace in the PASSporT.\" I gather the intent is to leave that means to local policy, or to be specified elsewhere. I think that's a problem from an interoperability standpoint. The verifier needs a way to know whether the authorizer is authoritative for the RPH. If we want authorizers and verifiers from different vendors to be able to interoperate, it seems like at least some mechanism needs to be standardized and possibly MTI.",
