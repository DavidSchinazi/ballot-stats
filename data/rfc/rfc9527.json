These services are far from perfect, but at least some of the limitations in Section 4 have been addressed, and others are arguably a feature and not a limitation.",

So it is fully permissible for a DoT server to run on a different port under such a mutual agreement. In general, for other possible transports, just because a port is assigned for use does not mean a deployment is obligated to run on it.",

The HNA (hidden primary?) to DM (primary) DNS communication using DNS Update needs some kind of authentication, TSIG or SIG0 ? While TLS gives you privacy, the DNS Update cannot be done with only TLS (as far as I understand it). I don't see any DHCP options to relay authentication information for automatic deployment? So I don't understand how this would startup and be able to setup a secure DNS update channel ? There was also talk about using ACME for TLS certificates, but wouldn't that require that the HNA already has a provisioned and working homenet domain ? (possibly more a question for the other draft, but just adding it here in case the hidden primary to primary is an \"almost DNS Update\" protocol that uses TLS instead f TSIG/SIG0.",
