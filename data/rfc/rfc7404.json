The document makes the claim that using LLAs between infrastructure devices reduces the attack surface of the network.\u00a0 However, I think there is an adverse side effect that needs to be discussed.\u00a0 If every device in a network follows this advice and only uses a globally-scoped address on its loopback interface, it seems easier to map the topology of the network.\u00a0 Since all responses to pings/traceroutes from a single router will have the same global address, an attacker can map adjacent devices by probing from different points outside the network.\u00a0 In the non-LLA case, responses to pings/traceroutes typically use the interface addresses, which would vary in the same type of probing.\u00a0 By reducing the number of addresses that can be used in ping/traceroute responses, the LLA-only network is more vulnerable to network mapping.",
