Section 6, paragraph 6 says : \"... if the TCP Originator stream is missing the stream prefix, or message frames are not parsable as IKE or ESP messages), it MUST close the TCP connection.\" IIUC, the entire point of having the stream prefix is to allow the TCP responder to demux between this protocol, and some other protocol that would normally run on that port. Saying it MUST close the TCP session seems to completely remove that value. I assume people meant to allow the respondent to delegate a stream out to some other protocol handler if the prefix is not present?",

        "text": "This draft suggests that ports that are assigned to other services can simply be used. This is not okay. If a port is assigned to a certain service, this service and/or the respective RFC defines how this port is used. Simply changing the specified behavior by requiring a check for a magic number cannot be done without updating the RFC that the port assignment belongs to. Also for the use of 4500/tcp  RFC3948  as well as the IANA registry would need to be updated. Further, as also mentioned in the tsv-art review (Thanks Wes!), this draft does not sufficiently handle the case of TCP in TCP encapsulation. Here a copy of the tsv-art review: Reviewer: Wesley Eddy Review result: On the Right Track This document is clear and well-written.\u00a0 It can easily be implemented based on the description. There are a few additional issues that should be considered with advice to implementers in Section 12 on performance considerations: 1) Invisibility of packet loss - Inner protocols that require packet losses as a signal of congestion (e.g. TCP) will have a challenge due to not being able to see any packet losses since the outer TCP will repair them (unless sending into a full outer TCP socket buffer shows up back to the inner TCP as a packet loss?). 2) Nesting of ECN -\u00a0 Inner TCP connections will not be able to use effectively ECN on the portion of the path covered by the outer TCP connection. 3) Impact of congestion response on aggregate - The general \"TCP in TCP\" problem is mentioned, and is mostly appropriate for a single flow.\u00a0 If an aggregate of flows is sharing the same outer TCP connection, there may be additional concerns about how the congestion response behavior impacts an aggregate of flows, since it may cause a shared delay spike even to low-rate flows rather than distributing losses proportional to per-flow throughput. 4) Additional potential for bufferbloat - Since TCP does not bound latency, some applications in the IPsec-protected aggregate could drive latency of the shared connection up and impact the aggregate of flows that may include real-time applications.\u00a0 The socket buffer for the outer TCP connection might need to be limited in size to ensure some bounds? Not addressing these could lead to poor experiences in deployment, if implementations make wrong assumptions or fail to consider them. In the security considerations section, there are several RFCs on mechanisms to increase robustness to RST attacks and SYN floods that could be mentioned if it's worthwhile.",
