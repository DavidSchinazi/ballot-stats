        "text": "Many thanks for taking on the task of producing a roll-up update for the core TCP specification!\u00a0 I am sure it was a lot of work, but I am happy to see it done. That said, I do have a few points that I would like to have a bit more discussion on before the document is published; I'm happy to see that Warren already linked to https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/  on the topic of what a DISCUSS position can (and cannot) mean. (1) We incorporate some long-standing enhancements that improve the security and robustness of TCP (in particular, random ISN and protection against off-path in-window attacks come to mind), but only at SHOULD or MAY requirements level. For example, we currently say: \u00a0  A TCP implementation MUST use the above type of \"clock\" for clock- \u00a0  driven selection of initial sequence numbers (MUST-8), and SHOULD \u00a0  generate its Initial Sequence Numbers with the expression: \u00a0  ISN = M + F(localip, localport, remoteip, remoteport, secretkey) and: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  +\u00a0  RFC 5961  [37] section 5 describes a potential blind data \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 injection attack, and mitigation that implementations MAY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 choose to include (MAY-12).\u00a0 TCP stacks that implement \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  RFC 5961  MUST add an input check that the ACK value is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [...] What prevents us from making a MUST-level requirement for randomized ISNs?\u00a0 Is it just the fact that it was only a SHOULD in  RFC 6528  and a perception that promoting to a MUST would be incompatible with retaining Internet Standard status? Likewise, what prevents using stronger normative language (e.g., MUST) for the  RFC 5961  protections? It seems to me that these mechanisms are of general applicability and provide significant value for use of TCP on the internet, even though they are not fully robust and do not use cryptographic mechanisms.\u00a0 If there are scenarios where their use is harmful or even just not applicable, that seems like an exceptional case that should get documented so as to strengthen the general recommendation for the non-exception cases. (2) I think this is just a process question to ensure that the IESG knows what we are approving at Internet Standard maturity, though it is certainly possible that I misunderstand the situation. In Section 3.7.3 we see the normative statement (SHLD-6) that \"when the when the effective MTU of an interface varies packet-to- packet, TCP implementations SHOULD use the smallest effective MTU of the interface to calculate the value to advertise in the MSS option\".\u00a0 This seems to originate in  RFC 6691  (being obsoleted by this document), but  RFC 6691 is only an Informational document and has not had an opportunity to \"accumulate experience at Proposed Standard before progressing\", to paraphrase  RFC 6410 . Similarly, Section 3.9.2 has (SHLD-23) \"Generally, an application SHOULD NOT change the DiffServ field value during the course of a connection (SHLD-23).\"\u00a0 This is a bit harder to track down, as the DiffServ field was not always known by that name.\u00a0 I actually failed to find a directly analogous previous statement of this guidance (presumably my error), and thus don't know if it had any experience at the PS level or not. RFC 6410  seems pretty clear that some revisions are okay in Internet Standards without such \"bake time\" at PS, but it does seem like something that should be done consciously rather than by accident. (3) This is also a process point for explicit consideration by the IESG. Appendix A.2 appears to discuss a few (rare) scenarios in which the technical mechanisms of this document fail catastrophically (e.g., getting stuck in a SYN|ACK loop and failing to complete the handshake). Does this meet the \"resolved known design choices\" and \"no known technical omission\" bar required by  RFC 2026  even for *proposed* standard? (Note that  RFC 2026  explicitly says that the IESG may waive this requirement, at least for PS.) (AFAICT one such scenario is reported at https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=3305  , which the change log for this document calls out as \"not applicable due to other changes\"; I am not sure which \"other changes\" are intended, for this case.) (4) Another point mostly just to get explicit IESG acknowledgment (elevating one of Lars' comments to DISCUSS level, essentially). As the changelog (and gen-art reviewer!) notes: \u00a0  Early in the process of updating  RFC 793 , Scott Brim mentioned that \u00a0  this should include a PERPASS/privacy review.\u00a0 This may be something \u00a0  for the chairs or AD to request during WGLC or IETF LC. I don't see any evidence to suggest that such a review actually occurred.\u00a0 Do we want to seek out such a targeted review before progressing?",
