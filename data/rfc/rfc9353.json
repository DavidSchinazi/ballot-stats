Why were 5088/89 so strict on not allowing new sub-TLVs? This seems quite unusual for IETF specs. I'm not arguing that this document can't update those earlier RFCs to allow these new sub-TLVs, but it seems odd to do so and in the same sentence say \"the restrictions should still be considered in place.\" ### Section 8.2, paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  The PCED sub-TLVs were defined in [ RFC5088 ] and [ RFC5089 ], but they \u00a0 \u00a0  did not create a registry for it.\u00a0 This document requests IANA to \u00a0 \u00a0  create a new registry called \"PCED sub-TLV type indicators\" under the \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Parameters\" grouping.\u00a0 The \u00a0 \u00a0  registration policy for this registry is \"IETF Review\" [ RFC8126 ]. \u00a0 \u00a0  Values in this registry come from the range 0-65535. ``` Should the registration policy not be stricter (e.g., Standards Action?) given that 5088/89 didn't even allow any new values?",

In section 3.3, it wasn't clear to me what the Key chain name is, or what exactly it refers to.\u00a0 Is this referring to a local key-chain name installed in a YANG Keystore (given that there is a reference to  RFC8177 ) or something else.\u00a0 Either way, I think that expanding on the description here would probably be very beneficial.",
