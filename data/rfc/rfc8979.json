The document makes no normative recommendations to minimize the identifiability or linkability of the information in the context header. It specifies no normative transport or object encryption, which  RFC 8300  conditionally requires (as does  RFC 8371  for similar identifiers). (Furthermore, although this documents says the context header should only be used within an administrative domain,  RFC 8300  allows for NSH to be used across administrative boundaries if I understand correctly.) The document does not suggest best practices for minimizing the persistence or uniqueness of the identifiers conveyed when circumstances allow it. As Ben noted, many functions performed by SFs don't need to be aware of actual subscriber identifiers that have some other purpose in the network (IP address, mobile network identifiers, etc.).  For other protocols that convey unique subscriber identifiers, even protocols that are not end-to-end like DHCP, the IETF has specified detailed guidance to minimize the privacy impact of exposing these identifiers. See, e.g.,  RFC 7844  and  RFC 8064 /7721. That level of analysis and guidance is what I would expect for this specification. I suspect that is an unpopular view, though, so I'm abstaining.",
