I know that we have had some previous discussion on this on Netmod, but, if  draft-ietf-netmod-yang-module-versioning-02  gets standardized then it will effectively evolve YANG's \"status deprecated\" into \"must implement or explicitly deviate\" and YANG's \"status obsolete\" into \"must not implement\".\u00a0 It wasn't clear to me that marking one of these fields as being deprecated in an IANA registry would mean that existing implementations must stop using it if they migrate to a new version of the generated YANG module.\u00a0 Hence, I think that at this stage, it may be safer to map IANA \"deprecated\" into YANG's \"status deprecated\"?",
