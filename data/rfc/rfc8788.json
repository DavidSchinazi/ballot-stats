        "text": "My understanding is that the intent of this document is to avoid a sharp \"cliff\" wherein several IETF procedures become invalid or unusable around the time of IETF 108, by postponing that cliff until around the time of IETF 111, on the assumption that a longer-term solution will be in place at that time.\u00a0 However, I think I need some help convincing myself that the current text succeeds in doing so, so let's discuss it... In particular, I'm looking at the ability to create a Recall Committee, an event that might well occur after IETF 108 (and thus, after the 2020-2021 NomCom has been seated).\u00a0 Currently in the Introduction and Section 3 we have text such as: \u00a0  This update is an emergency interpretation of the intent of  BCP 10 \u00a0  for this current exceptional situation only, and applies only to \u00a0  [...] any rules that relate to NomCom eligibility or process before \u00a0  IETF 108. My question comes in, then, as to whether a hypothetical formation of a Recall Committee after IETF 108 is or relies on an event or process that is excluded by the clause about \"process before IETF 108\".\u00a0  RFC 8713 does not immediatly bring clarity, discussing that: %\u00a0 The recall committee is created according to the same rules as is the %\u00a0 NomCom with the qualifications that both the person being %\u00a0 investigated and the parties requesting the recall must not be a %\u00a0 member of the recall committee in any capacity. Since the volunteer qualifications that cover both NomCom and Recall Committee members refer to \"the date on which the solicitation for NomCom volunteers was submitted for distribution to the IETF community\", it seems that we use the same date (and thus the same set of IETF meetings for the 3 of 5 criteria) for the attendance requirement of the volunteers, so that is not a problem.\u00a0 But does the act of (say) running the selection process constitute a \"NomCom eligibility or process\"?\u00a0 I'm not sure how to make a clear interpretation here. I think what we are concerned about is the requirement for attendance that has to have applied before IETF 108, but we may not necessarily want to exclude all things that happen after IETF 108.\u00a0 For example, we might arrive at a phrasing that this will apply to \"events that occurred before the scheduled time for IETF 108\".",
