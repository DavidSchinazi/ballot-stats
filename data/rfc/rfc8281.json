And I found this document very easy to read as a reviewer - thanks for that. I found a couple of places where SHOULDs seemed at least under-specified, and this one looked important. In this text, \u00a0 LSP State Synchronization procedures are described in section 5.4 of \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce ].\u00a0 During State Synchronization, a PCC \u00a0  reports the state of its LSPs to the PCE using PCRpt messages, \u00a0  setting the SYNC flag in the LSP Object.\u00a0 For PCE-initiated LSPs, the \u00a0  PCC MUST also set the Create Flag in the LSP Object and MAY include \u00a0  the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV identifying the PCE that requested the LSP \u00a0  creation.\u00a0 At the end of state synchronization, the PCE SHOULD \u00a0  compare the reported PCE-Initiated LSPs with its configuration.\u00a0 For \u00a0  any mismatch, the PCE SHOULD send a PCInitiate message to initiate \u00a0  any missing LSPs and/or remove any LSPs that are not wanted. I\u2019m having a hard time understanding why a PCE would not compare reported PCE-Initiated LSPs with its configuration, which is allowed by the first SHOULD. Does that mean you thought it was important to TRY to synchronize, but you\u2019re not curious enough to check whether that worked?  I can imagine reasons why you wouldn't try to fix the LSPs that weren't synchronized, at least not immediately, but you might also give guidance about one or more reasons why you wouldn't try, to help implementers understand what not doing what the SHOULD means, and make informed choices for their implementations.",
