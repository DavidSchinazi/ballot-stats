        "text": "I appreciate the clear statement that the protocol described in this document is not backward compatible with ESADI as described in  RFC 6325 . However, this makes me question the migration strategy and  interoperability issues. It looks like every rbridge attached to an end station in a particular Data Label needs to be speaking the same version of ESADI, or that some rbridges must speak both versions and work out which one to use. Questions that need to be answered are: * What happens when a 6325 implementation meets an implementation of \u00a0 this I-D? How will it handle the new LSPs/PDUs and how will the  \u00a0 implementation of this I-D know what to do to correctly advertise \u00a0 its attached end stations? * What happens when an implementation of this I-D meets an  \u00a0 implementation of 6325? How will it handle the obsolete LSPs and how \u00a0 will it learn about end stations attached to the 6325 implementation? * Is there a migration strategy from 6325 to this I-D? I suspect some of the answer is through neighbor determination, but since 6325 implementations are presumably in the wild there needs to be some discussion o how this hangs together.",

Even if this is limited to campus networks, in various countries, data protection issues may come into play.
