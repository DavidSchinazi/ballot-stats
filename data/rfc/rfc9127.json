        "text": "I will apologize in advance because this document may be sort of a casualty of this DISCUSS. I should have raised my point below at least two years ago if not four years ago when the first iana-* YANG module was registered, but the thought did not occur to me until now.  It gives me some pause to see the name \"iana\" embedded in the file name, module name, namespace, and prefix of the module being defined in Sec. 2.12. I realize there is precedent here, but I question whether tying these kinds of modules specifically to IANA as the protocol parameter registry operator by name puts them on the most stable deployment footing under all possible circumstances. I am personally pleased as punch with the service we get from IANA, but that doesn't mean \"IANA\" will always be the name of the registry operator. The more modules that get created with this embedding, the more of them that may need to change in the unlikely event that the name of the registry operator changes. Lots of RFCs would need to change too, but embedding the name extends the potential problem to the modules themselves. It wasn't clear to me whether there is some ops-area-wide convention around the embedding of \"iana\" in the names of modules to be maintained by IANA. I don't see this specifically referenced in  RFC 7950  or  RFC 6020 . So I'd like to discuss whether a different naming convention could be established and used in this document and others going forward.",

Are \"number-of-sessions-admin-down\" included in \"number-of-sessions-down\"?
