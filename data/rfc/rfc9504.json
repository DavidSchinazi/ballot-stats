Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address, do not panic ;-) ), two non-blocking COMMENT points. Special thanks to Dhruv Dhody for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus *and* the justification of the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric # DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Mismatch in meta-data & the content While the meta-data is about \"standard track\" the I-D itself says \"informational\". The IETF Last Call has been done for \"standard track\", so a revised I-D is enough to address this DISCUSS.",
