My primary issue here is that a requirement to \"consider\" is not the same an MTI (mandatory to implement).\u00a0 Further, the  RFC 3414  mechanisms referred to in  RFC 3410  for authentication are HMAC-based and for privacy are CBC-DES-based. Don't really have a problem with the authentication protocols (see  RFC 6151  and 6194) but I do have a really big problem with the CBC-DES-based privacy mechanism.\u00a0 The reworded boiler plate takes in to account the AES-based privacy mechanism  RFC 3414  refers to as a draft.\u00a0 I can not believe you'd really use a DES-based mechanism instead of the AES-based mechanism and if you are I'd like to see some text about that. The bit about the TSM is a nod to reality about how the data will be gathered.\u00a0 I'm guessing here but I suspect that SSH is used with the router so you could just say SSH is required as opposed to the current wishy washy one or the approach in the new boiler plate.",
