        "text": "I have a question about the interaction between the protocol versioning and the way the flags B-H are defined. This doc specifies that B MUST be set to 0 and that future specs might require it to be set to 1, which could alter the meanings of the C-H flags. This is the same way that B is defined in  RFC 6824 . This spec goes on to define C and H differently from how they are defined in  RFC 6824 . Thus, both v0 and v1 implementations will have B set to 0, but they will have C and H defined differently. I guess it depends on how you interpret \"extensibility flag,\" but my interpretation of this is that the version number negotiated using MP_CAPABLE is the actual extensibility mechanism that this specification is making use of, because although it changed C and H it did not change B. Is this right? If so, I'm wondering what the threshold is for defining new versions of this protocol versus using this extensibility mechanism based on the B flag. Given the way the version negotiation mechanism is defined -- requiring extra round-trips in the event of a fallback attempt, and it being subject to a downgrade attack -- I'm wondering if some guidance needs to be provided about which sorts of protocol changes are expected to be made using the B-flag mechanism versus using the version negotiation mechanism. I guess the drawback of using the B-flag mechanism is that once a future spec sets it to 1, from then on logic within implementations will be required to interpret potentially multiple different semantics of C-H. I guess this potentially raises another question, which is why the B flag isn't just deprecated given the addition of the version negotiation mechanism.",
