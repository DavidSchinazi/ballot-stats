        "text": "# \u00c9ric Vyncke, INT AD, comments for  draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-deployment-08 CC @evyncke Thank you for the work put into this document even if I had hoped for a cleaner document. I also regret that security is not mentioned as an incentive to deploy IPv6 security policies as most end-points have IPv6 enabled by default. I am also concerned that this document did not get enough reviews (thanks Robert for your  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/v6ops/Trz62uglkVKOuXY3gXV_lNpyBEc/  and 3 reviews -- if not mistaken -- during V6OPS WGLC). Please find below several blocking DISCUSS points (should the document be sent back to the V6OPS WG ?) and some non-blocking COMMENT points. Special thanks to Fred Baker for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus and the justification of the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document because it is important Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Section 1.1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IPv4 as a Service (IPv4aaS): It means that IPv4 service support is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 provided by means of transition mechanism, therefore there is a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 combination of encapsulation/translation + IPv6-only overlay + \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 decapsulation/translation.\u00a0 For an IPv6-only network, connectivity \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to legacy IPv4 is either non-existent or provided by IPv4aaS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 mechanisms. ``` It must be \"IPv6-only underlay\", see other use of \"underlay/overlay\" in other IETF published RFC: 7364, 7365, 9272, ... ### Section 4.2 overlay Again the title and the introduction are incorrect. It should be \"IPv4 as a Service and IPv6-only ***Underlay***\". ``` \u00a0  Both are IPv4aaS solutions by leveraging IPv6-only overlay.\u00a0 IPv4aaS \u00a0  offers Dual-Stack service to users and allows an ISP to run IPv6-only \u00a0  in the network (typically, the access network). ``` The above text repeats the same mistake. ### Section 4.2 464XLT and MAP-T While I really like 464XLT, it should not appear in a section with \"underlay\" as it is *not* an encapsulation mechanism. The same reasoning applies for MAP-T. The section should be about IPv4aaS then 464XLAT and MAP-T could be included. ### Section 5.2 ``` \u00a0  IPv6 addresses can be assigned to an interface \u00a0  through different means, such as Stateless Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) \u00a0  [ RFC4862 ], stateful and stateless Dynamic Host Control Protocol \u00a0  (DHCP) [ RFC8415 ].\u00a0  ``` Stateless DHCPv6 *does not* assign IPv6 addresses/prefixes. ### Section 5.4.2 As it is linked to security, I am raising this to a DISCUSS level. Fragmentation can be used to bypass all layer-4 filters not only in NDP as mentioned in the draft, but in any protocol. Please add text about  RFC 8200  section 5: ``` \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Extension headers, if any, and the Upper-Layer header.\u00a0 These \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  headers must be in the first fragment. ```",
