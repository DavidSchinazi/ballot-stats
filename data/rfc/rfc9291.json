        "text": "Thanks for the effort to produce\u00a0 this\u00a0 YANG model, I always fascinate by the work done in creating the YANG models. I have found inconsistencies in the classification of normative references and informative references, hence, would like to discuss those. Some examples below- - in the terminology section while\u00a0 [ RFC6241 ], [ RFC7950 ], [ RFC8466 ], [ RFC4026 ], and [ RFC8309 ] are normative references, [ RFC8969 ] and [ RFC8340 ] are not. But clearly this document uses terms defined in those documents and I as a reader had to open those RFCs to understand what the terms are and without that I would not be possible to understand this document. - sometimes the this document is correctly referring to other documents as normative, as terms or processes are defines there but sometimes it is not. for example - \u00a0 \u00a0 'signaling-option': Indicates a set of signaling options that are specific to a given VPN network access, e.g., a CE ID ('ce-id' identifying the CE within the VPN) and a remote CE ID as discussed in Section 2.2.2 of [ RFC6624 ]. Now, without understanding what is discussed or defined in  RFC6624  it was hard for me to understand the node/leaf mentioned in this document. Thus, I felt\u00a0 RFCC6624 should be a normative reference but it was not.  - The reference modules from this document cannot be informative reference, can they? For example in section 8.1 it says - \u00a0  This module references [ RFC3032 ], [ RFC4446 ], [ RFC4448 ], [ RFC4553 ], [ RFC4618 ], [ RFC4619 ], [ RFC4717 ], [ RFC4761 ], [ RFC4816 ], [ RFC4842 ], and [ RFC5086 ]. however,  RFC4842  and  RFC5086  is informative reference. I would say, please go through the document and correctly categorise all the references.",
