So I noticed  RFC 5228  that do reference  RFC 4234  which is now obsolete, and the current in force version of ABNF is  RFC 5234 . Also as no WSP are included in the rules, this document appears to use ABNF to express  RFC 5228  grammar and not parsing syntax. So please clarify prior to the usages what the formal language is and what it represents.  So this needs to be done prior to Section 5. But, can you please check that you actually have the same level of\u00a0 formal syntax in Section 5 that goes through  RFC 8580  as what is in Section 8. Otherwise please clarify both.  Secondly, I do consider the defining text first paragraph of in Section 4.1 so hard to interpret that it must be fixed prior to publication. So although you already are going to address it based on discussion of Martin Duke's comment, I want to hold a discuss on this.",
