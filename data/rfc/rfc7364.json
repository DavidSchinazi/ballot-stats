        "text": "The nodes of a virtual network, once running, can look after securing their own traffic. That might lead one to say that nvo3 traffic isolation doesn't need to consider confidentiality. However, if the nodes in a virtual network are VMs and if VMs can be moved, then any secrets required for the virtual network to secure its traffic will be exposed to the underlay during the move.  I'm not clear if this wg will try address that issue or not. Section 10 does say that some environments might be concerned about confidentiality but is vague about whether or not the wg will work on the topic. Such a confidentiality service isn't a panacea of course, the underlay components providing the confidentiality service could leak the relevant keys, but it could still be useful nonetheless. (BTW, I've no idea if it'd make sense to have such a service that's separated from whatever technology is used to move the VM or not.) So the discuss point is: will the wg actually define such a confidentiality service or not? Note that I'm not trying to insist on a \"yes\" answer, even though I think that'd be good. Even a \"maybe, and that'll be answered in the requirements specs before we re-charter\" would be ok. But regardless of the answer, I think it'd be good to at least note this issue in the security considerations section.",
