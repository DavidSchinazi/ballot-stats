The example in Section 5.4: \u00a0 \u00a0  STRUCTURED-DATA;FMTTYPE=application/ld+json; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SCHEMA=\" https://schema.org/FlightReservation \"; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:Zm9vYmFy contains an inline value that doesn't seem to decode to a valid FlightReservation JSON object. Perhaps I'm misreading, but the ABNF in Section 7.6 does not seem to allow for an explicit VALUE=TEXT parameter to be given, and the description does not list TEXT as the default value type.\u00a0 (I note that the listed example does include VALUE=TEXT, causing this to rise to a Discuss-level internal inconsistency.)
