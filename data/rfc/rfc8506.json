The text says: \"In addition to the Redirect-Server AVP or Redirect-Server-Extension \u00a0  AVP, the credit-control server MAY include one or more Restriction- \u00a0  Filter-Rule AVPs, one or more Filter-Rule AVPs, or one or more \u00a0  Filter-Id AVPs in the Credit-Control-Answer message to enable the \u00a0  user to access other services (for example, zero-rated services).\u00a0 In \u00a0  such a case, the access device MUST drop all the packets not matching \u00a0  the IP filters specified in the Restriction-Filter-Rule AVPs, Filter- \u00a0  Rule AVPs or Filter-Id AVPs.\u00a0 If enforcement actions other than \u00a0  allowing the packets (e.g., QoS), are indicated in the Filter-Rule \u00a0  AVPs or Filter-Id AVPs, they SHOULD be performed as well.\u00a0 In \u00a0  addition, if possible, to redirecting the user to the destination \u00a0  specified in the Redirect-Server AVP or Redirect-Server-Extension \u00a0  AVP.\" It seems like if the server sends a Redirect-Server AVP or Redirect-Server-Extension AVP without any of the other AVPs, then all the traffic is supposed to be redirected. But if a Restriction-Filter-Rule AVP, Filter-Rule AVP, or Filter-Id AVP is also included, then the non-matching traffic MUST be dropped, in which case how does the user get redirected? Is the last sentence (which is a sentence fragment, actually) supposed to address this somehow? And in the case of enforcement actions involving QoS, the text seems to say that packets matching the filter MUST be dropped AND have the QoS rules applied to them, so I don't understand how that works. = Section 15.1 = RFC 6733  lists a bunch of sensitive AVPs and then says this about them: \"Diameter messages containing these or any other AVPs considered to be \u00a0  security-sensitive MUST only be sent protected via mutually \u00a0  authenticated TLS or IPsec.\u00a0 In addition, those messages MUST NOT be \u00a0  sent via intermediate nodes unless there is end-to-end security \u00a0  between the originator and recipient or the originator has locally \u00a0  trusted configuration that indicates that end-to-end security is not \u00a0  needed.\" It seems like the list of AVPs in Section 15.1 should have these same requirements applied to them explicitly.",

        "text": "I support Alissa's Discuss point about sensitive AVPs. I appear to have a different understanding of Section 5.6.2, though, with a different potential issue (but again, it's possible that I'm confused to how things work): With the redirection schemes covered in Section 5.6.2, it sounds like the user can be redirected (at the application protocol level, e.g., HTTP or SIP) to a top-up server to purchase more credits.\u00a0 I don't see a way described how user agents can distinguish between a Diameter-induced redirect and an attacker-induced redirect to a (potentially phishing) site that accepts payment information.\u00a0 To be  clear, the scenario here is that a user is using a credit-controlled  application session to talk to \"arbitrary application servers\",  including potentially attacker-controllled HTTP/SIP/etc. servers;  the attacker could introduce a redirect to a phishing page that asks  for payment information, and the user would be led to believe that  this was the normal flow for \"my prepaid balance has been used up\",  and give their payment information to the phishing site. I think that either user agents need to give some indication that this DIAMETER-level redirect is different than an application-protocol-level redirect (e.g., http) or the Security Considerations need to mention the risk of acclimating users to arbitrary websites redirecting to sites asking for payment credentials, which may or may not be legitimate sites. Separately, in Section 8.68 (for QoS-Final-Unit-Indication): \u00a0  If the Final-Unit-Action AVP is set to REDIRECT at least the \u00a0  Redirect-Server-Extension AVP MUST be present. This MUST seems in conflict with the text in 8.64 (actually, is section 8.64 even internally inconsistent, too?) about \"Redirect-Server AVP, in addition to or instead of the Redirect-Server-Extension AVP\", in particular, the \"instead of\" portion.\u00a0 (The ABNF-based formal language spec in 8.68 does match up with the above MUST, though.)",
