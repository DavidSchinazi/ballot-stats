        "text": "It seems that we accumulated some factual errors by letting this draft sit mostly idle since 2018, as the world evolved around us.\u00a0 Hopefully these are easy to remedy... Section 3.4.1.2 claims to have a list of options that have been specified as Hop-by-Hop options, and Section 3.4.6.2 a list of options that have been specified as Destination Options, each respectively \"at the time of this writing\".\u00a0 IANA has a single registry for both Destination and Hop-by-Hop options, and assessing which ones are defined as Hop-by-Hop vs Destinationmay require following each reference, but it seems that the PDM option from  RFC 8250  has been allocated and is in neither list, and the early allocations for IOAM and Path MTU Record may need to be considered as well.\u00a0 I suppose that we do attempt to go into the individual optiosn in detail in Section 4.3, so perhaps this is not quite so simple to remedy after all. (Note: while it is not the preferred outcome, merely changing the statement from \"time of this writing\" and \"so far been specified\" to \"as of 2018\" ought to be sufficient to resolve the discuss, as would Lars' suggestion of just referring to the IANA registry without incorporating the registry contents.) Section 3.4.8.1 refers to HIP as an \"experimental protocol\", but as of RFC 7401 , HIP is on the standards track. Also, there seems to be some skew between Table 1 and Section 3.4.10.5 regarding the recommended filtering policy for the experimental/testing EH types (drop vs [no recommendation])",
