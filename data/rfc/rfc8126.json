Right now the guidance amounts to: \"include a URL, make sure it's a permalink, but we can't tell you how to find or construct a permalink reliably, so ask IANA, but we don't tell you how to ask.\" If we're far enough away from having a standard way to find or construct permalinks that we can't say anything more specific about how authors might figure out what to include, then I think it's preferable to just tell people to include a URL for the registry in question and note that IANA will confirm whether to replace it with a permalink as part of its document processing. Asking authors to have an additional back-and-forth with IANA because we don't have an easy way for authors to identify permalinks seems like a waste of time for both sides.",

So here is my DISCUSS, expressing that I want to discuss this document with the IESG. High level summary: The two issues that an IANA considerations section writer care about are: 1. Determining the right procedure (FCFS, Expert Review, etc...). This is relatively easy 2. What should the IANA considerations section contain? Give us a check list. \u00a0 \u00a0 All of us start from examples. This is what we need. \u00a0 \u00a0 I see those examples in section 4.X. Good: You can expect IETF draft authors to use those examples, as starting points. However, with the current document organization and with the (lack of)  RFC 2119  language, it's not too clear to the readers what the checklist is to write an IANA considerations section. Example \"change control policy and a change controller\". This is missing from the few examples I checked, and it's no clear from the text either if it's a MAY/SHOULD/MUST. So mixed feelings about this document. Not sure it's well organized for the intended audience: \"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs \".",

        "text": "2.1/2.2 - You rightly point out in 2.1 that the terminology has been inconsistent in the past. But then you go ahead in 2.2 and use the two most confusing terms that you could use (\"registry\" for the grouping and \"sub-registry\" for the thing that contains the namespace). Please come up with terminology for this version of the document and stick to it. I would very much prefer \"Category\" (or \"Grouping\") for the grouping and \"Registry\" for the thing that contains the namespace. The documentation requirement should be for the Registry name, and, if desired, the Category (or Grouping) into which the Registry goes. The grouping can be identified by name or (if it already exists) by URL. If you insist on using the terms \"registry\" and \"sub-registry\" (and I implore you not to), please at least define those terms in terms of category, grouping, and namespace. In any event, please do not update this document without fixing the problem. 2.2 - The size/format section makes it confusing as to whether you're defining technical *protocol* requirements (which don't belong in the registry definition) or requirements for the registry itself (i.e., how things are displayed or stored by IANA). I particularly don't like giving UTF8 as an example. If the thing in the registry is a text string, then \"Z\u00fcrich\" is a fine entry, whether it is stored in the registry at IANA with the second character as U+00FC or U+0075 U+0308 (however encoded); the registry should point back elsewhere in the document to define the encoding requirements or the normalizations that might be used. However, if the thing in the registry is a specific UTF8-encoded octet-string, then what should appear in the registry should either contain \"0xC3 0xBC\" or it should contain \"0x75 0xCC 0x88\" and not appear as \"\u00fc\". The paragraph should make that clear. In the example, I'm not clear on what \"under the FooBar option\" means. That sounds like there is a Category called \"FooBar Options\" somewhere, but I don't think that's what you mean.",
