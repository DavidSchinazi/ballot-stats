If so, this worries me a bit.  RFC 6679  I believe retains flexibility for endpoints to react to congestion in ways that are different from TCP and dependent on specific codecs, topologies, and other factors.  RFC 3551  provides a lot of qualification in the requirements it places around equivalence to TCP's behavior. So I would be concerned about how this requirement, if normative, would affect RTP and other protocols. If it's not meant to be normative, I would suggest using \"ought to\" or some other word.",
