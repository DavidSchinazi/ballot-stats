(2) Figure 1 seems really confusing.\u00a0 If the reader notices the phrase \"9 octets of the frame header\", he'll probably come to the right conclusion, but it also seems likely that some readers will infer from the layout that the header is 12 octets long, with the fields aligned to word boundaries.\u00a0 Just eliminating the header with the bit positions would help a lot.\u00a0 Likewise for the figures in Section 6. (3) Section 9.1.1: \"For \"http\" resources...\" This seems to imply that requests for \"http\" resources can only be carried over bare TCP, which seems wrong given the presence of the \":scheme\" pseudo-header.\u00a0 Proposed text:  OLD: \"For \"http\" resources, this depends on the host having resolved to the same IP address.\" NEW: \"For TCP connections without TLS, this depends on the host having resolved to the same IP address.\" (4) Section 9.1.1: \"For \"https\" resources...\" The salient requirement here is that the certificate provided by the server MUST pass any checks that the client would have done if it were initiating the connection afresh.\u00a0 In addition to the name check here, that would include things like HPKP.\u00a0 Suggested text: OLD: \"For \"https\" resources, connection reuse additionally depends on having a certificate that is valid for the host in the URI.\" NEW: \"For \"https\" resources, connection reuse additionally depends on having a certificate that is valid for the host in the URI.\u00a0 The certificate presented by the server MUST satisfy any checks that the client would perform when forming a new TLS connection for the host in the URI (e.g. HPKP checks [HPKP]).\"  (5) Section 10.4: \"Pushed responses for which an origin server is not authoritative (see Section 10.1) are never cached or used.\" This seems like a rather important point, for which I can't find any normative text.\u00a0 It seems like in Section 8.2.1, the client should be REQUIRED to verify that the \":authority\" field in the PUSH_PROMISE contains a value for which the client would have been willing to re-use the connection (as specified in Section 9.1).",
