Clarification question: what is the connection between this draft and the AQM WG? AQM is supposed to obsolete  RFC 2309 , and at the same time, this document updates  RFC 2309 . I see that  draft-ietf-aqm-recommendation  normatively references  draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest So should this document (at least section 2, the recommendations) be part of  draft-ietf-aqm-recommendation ? To add to the/my confusion, the document abstract speaks about Codel and PIE, which, IIRC, are the two protocols discussed in AQM. What will be the situation when  draft-ietf-aqm-recommendation  will be a RFC? This RFC will obsolete  RFC 2309 , and reference (or maybe obsolete)  draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest , which in turn will update  RFC 2309 . How do you see this working? Is this an issue? I would like to discuss this with responsible AD during the IESG telechat. Hence my DISCUSS-DISCUSS. One proposal is that  draft-ietf-aqm-recommendation  copies the recommendations from  draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest  (btw, it does that with the current version), and that it references the  draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest , which justifies the recommendations. An informational reference would be good enough, and would avoid some confusion... I guess. A (cleaner) alternative is for  draft-ietf-tsvwg-byte-pkt-congest  to be a companion document to  draft-ietf-aqm-recommendation , in the AQM WG. Advantage: it doesn't update  RFC 2309 . Drawback: some extra delay.",

        "text": "I think Sean is on to something regarding status and the Updates metadata, but I think it's even more interesting than he indicates. 2309 was an IRTF document, which explains why it is Informational. If we have now gotten to the point that the recommendations in 2309 really are all requirements (except for the preferential treatment of small packets), doesn't that justify bringing that document into the IETF stream in addition to this one, or incorporating the recommendations of 2309 into this document? If this is only updating the research in 2309, then it is appropriate to keep this document Informational as well. But if this document deserves a \"higher\" status, it sounds like (at least the content of) 2309 does too. Please explain. I'd also like to hear a bit about the status itself. BCP is usually for recommendations of policy and operational guidelines. But the things in this document sound more like protocol recommendations, and things that we'd get implementation experience with over time, not things that should instantly jump to the \"done\" level of a BCP. Is there a reason this isn't going for the standards track instead of BCP? It sounds like protocol to me. Finally, if this is to be a BCP, I wonder if it should be folded into  BCP 41  and not made a new BCP all by itself. I'd like to hear if you think this is part of the set of overall \"Congestion Control Principles\" or has some reason to stand alone. An explanation of how  BCP 41  ( RFC 2914 ),  RFC 2309 , and this document fit together would be quite useful.",
