Section 5 has a \"MUST\" for using the same hash for the CMS digestAlgorithm and the HSS/LMS tree, but Section 6 only has a \"SHOULD\" for the message-digest attribute's digest and the signed attributes digest (the latter of which MUST be the HSS/LMS hash per the previous); should these two requirements be at the same level of normativity?\u00a0 I'm not sure why the one would be more important for correct operation than the other.",
