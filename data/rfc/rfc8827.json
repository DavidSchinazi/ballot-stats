I've tried to note these in the COMMENT section (though having finished reading the document, perhaps I am overzealous about determination that an authoritative IdP is indeed authoritative). I also think that we need to be more careful about having the IdP know the semantics of what it's signing (or otherwise attesting to), so that it does not turn into a signing oracle, etc.. The \"Modifying the Session\" treatment for the SDP \"identity\" attribute seems incompletely specified. I'm a bit unclear about how the port in the IdP URI's Authority (Section 7.5) would get discovered.\u00a0 If it can be remotely supplied, there may be risks in just trusting blindly whatever value is received. It seems like there are some unstated privacy considerations in allowing the IdP proxy to automatically generate an assertion (that reveals the user's identity) at the request of javascript from the calling application, as described in Section 7.7. Section 9.4 talks about how the IdP is attesting to the binding of the user identified in the assertion with the key fingerprints, but in Sections 7.4 and 7.6 we claim that this assertion is \"opaque to the IdP\"; these statements appear to be in conflict with each other.",
