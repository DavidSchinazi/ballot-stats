        "text": "First, thank you for a clearly written document that contained enough context to trigger my hazy memory of some of the technical details. My concern is around this paragraph in the Introduction: \"The MPLS label value in the Ethernet A-D route can be set to the \u00a0  VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) for VXLAN encap, and this VNI may have \u00a0  a global scope or local scope per PE and may also be equal to the \u00a0  VPWS service instance identifier set in the Ethernet A-D route. \" First, I recognize that folks have implemented and deployed EVPN with VXLAN. That's fine.\u00a0 There is an ISE  RFC 7348  that describes VXLAN.\u00a0  Depending on what you (authors, shepherd, AD, WG) decide to do about the rest of my concern, it is likely that this should be normative references - which would be a downref. Second, the paragraph here isn't really adequate to describe how to implement the functionality.\u00a0  I don't see how: \u00a0 \u00a0 a) The ingress PE decides which VNIs it can send based upon the VNI=MPLS_label \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 from the egress.\u00a0  Is there an assumption that VXLAN allows sending all VNIs across \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the particular VPWS, whether port-based, VLAN-based, etc? \u00a0 \u00a0 b) Is there an assumption that the egress PE-advertised MPLS label also indicates the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  VNI to be used?\u00a0 That seems like another mode, like the VLAN-based service, except \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  it is perhaps VNI + VLAN-based service? Please don't take this Discuss as a reason to remove the paragraph and the implied functionality. If it's implemented and deployed (and I think it is) - then what I really want is to just have it adequately written down so that others can interoperably implement.\u00a0 The downref to VXLAN should just be a matter of process nuisance (i.e. another IETF Last Call and handling any concerns).",
