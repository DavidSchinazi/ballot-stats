However, even after having read the reply to Marin's comment I don't think this document is published with the right status.  - The document defines new CBOR attributes, that is standard track work as it comes out as consensus document from a IETF WG.  - It does not define or document crypto algorithm just refer to existing ones. - The charter item might have been reasonable as informational if existing attributes could have been used. With the choice to define new attributes I think this has entered standards track. - The status of the document I think will also affect the value that IANA might assign to these COSE Header Parameters.  If there are additional considerations I am happy to learn about them.  Else, I would propose a change of status to proposed standard and redo the IETF last call.",
