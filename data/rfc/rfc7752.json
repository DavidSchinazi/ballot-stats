        "text": "Note: This may sound like a scary discuss, and who knows but it might lead to us recognising that some significant work is needed in future, but I think this should be easily fixed for this particular document...  This document does recognise that there can be confidentiality or privacy issues with exporting information in this way. And it correctly (I think) says that just not sending that sensitive data is a good way to handle this and that mechanisms for e.g.\u00a0 aggregating to ensure privacy are out of scope. (As an aside: strengthening that recommendation would be a good thing I think.) However, noting that e.g. ALTO servers can be handling data that is privacy sensitive for specific users (e.g. see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285#section-15.3  and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285#section-15.4 ), I think there are two more things that need to be noted here, but that are not. (1) First is that this document does change (what I understand, perhaps imperfectly, as) the security model for BGP, in that previously we have assumed that BGP speakers are not exposing user-specific privacy sensitive information. This draft seems to me to change that. (If it does not, then a reference to where that was previously done would be needed, or an explanation of why I'm wrong:-) If you could add a strong recommendation to not do that, I think that'd be good. (I do get that that can't be an easily implemented MUST NOT statement though, so I'm not quite sure what text to suggest, but it oughtn't be too hard to figure something out.) (2) Second, I wonder if the above change means that we need to seriously consider confidentiality for BGP. The RPKI does not, but then neither did DNSSEC for years until we belatedly realised that that was a real issue. I'm not asking that this draft provide a mechanism for confidentiality for BGP, but that at least recognising the issue as real (if it is) seems to be required. (And nor am I asking that a confidentiality system as complex as the rpki be developed, I think that if anything is needed here beyond data minimisation, then transport layer security would be as good as it'd get.) The change here would be to simply recognise this consequence, if it is real, and that could be a simple sentennce in the draft, e.g. saying that these changes to BGP might result in PII being emitted, and hence might cause a real need for confidentiality for BGP.",
