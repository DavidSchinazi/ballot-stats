RFC3692  defines the experimental values as  \"\u00a0 Mutually consenting devices could use \u00a0  these numbers for whatever purposes they desire, but under the \u00a0  understanding that they are reserved for generic testing purposes, \u00a0  and other implementations may use the same numbers for different \u00a0  experimental uses.\" which means that devices may use any of the sub-types under 15 for experimentation and potentially collide with the \"extension\" uses. I would propose that a sub range of the sub-types (e.g. 2048-4095) under type 15 be reserved for experimentation and the rest of the range (0-2047) for extensions be specified using some other IANA policy (e.g. FCFS as specified in the document).",
