I found it to be well-organized and easy to read. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a process discuss for Roman to handle, and I plan to clear it during the IESG formal telechat. This document is intended for BCP status. It has a normative reference to  RFC 8017 , which is an informational document. Checking the last call text ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp/edit/lastcalltext/ ), there is no mention of  RFC 8017 , nor does  RFC 8017  appear in the downref registry ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref/ ). Thanks to  RFC 8067 , we are not required to run this document through IETF LC again (and, given that  RFC 8017 's predecessor,  RFC 3447 , is in the registry, we probably don't want to). However, we'll need to minute that the point was raised and addressed. There is also at least one additional requirement imposed by section 2 of  RFC 8067  that needs to be satisfied (see the last sentence in that section).",

(I do see that in Section 3.7 of this document we do mandate UTF-8 for JWT, which makes things unambiguous, even if this text here is not correct.) Section 3.2 notes: \u00a0  JWT libraries SHOULD NOT generate JWTs using \"none\" unless explicitly \u00a0  requested to do by the caller. I couldn't find anywhere where we have matching guidance about \"SHOULD NOT consume JWTs using 'none' unless explicitly requested\"; this seems important enough to get called out explicitly.",
