Just one discuss item: \u00a0  Peers MAY negotiate both Cryptex and the header extension mechanism \u00a0  defined in [ RFC6904 ] via signaling, and if both mechanisms are \u00a0  supported, either one can be used for any given packet.\u00a0 However, if \u00a0  a packet is encrypted with Cryptex, it MUST NOT also use [ RFC6904 ] \u00a0  header extension encryption, and vice versa. Why this complexity? Based on the Section 1, Cryptex is much more preferred. Why allow \"either one can be used for any given packet\" instead of saying if both are negotiated, Cryptex SHOULD be used? Or why not stronger, if both peers support Cryptex,  RFC6904  SHOULD NOT (MUST NOT?) be used?",
