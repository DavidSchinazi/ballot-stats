But I agree with Ted that the IETF seems to have rough consensus to publish this, which is a pity IMO. - Where is there a definition of a private DNS namespace? If that is not defined, how can an implementer or deployment know whether or not its ok to publish these records in their DNS? I *think* I know that is meant, but not very precisely and absent such a definition isn't there a real danger that the (weak) privacy mitigation suggested will be mythical? (If a good definition exists, all that'd be needed is a reference, and I'm not saying that I think that has to be an RFC, just good and easily accessible.) - abstract and intro: I think you should s/where/if/ in: \"This document specifies an interoperable encoding of these address types for use in private DNS namespaces, where the privacy concerns can be constrained and mitigated.\" The current text suggests that all you need is a \"private DNS namespace\" and you're done, which is not the case. - Section 5: It was my impression that the IETF LC demonstrated a consensus that the Canadian regulation was crappy. I think to properly reflect the quite rough consensus this should say something about that here, so that its clear that these RRs are not what the IETF would do, were it to design a solution for this use-case.  - Section 8: was any consideration given to putting ciphertext forms of these values into RRs? Surely that'd be a better mitigation than depending on access control for DNS queries? For example, in the cited use-case the EUI value could be encrypted with a public-key before being placed into the DNS. (Yes, that's also a crappy solution, but perhaps less crappy than this.)",
