Something like the following text should be fine \"The privacy and security properties of the mechanism specified in this document are generally similar to those already present in the ALTO protocol. However, because queries for multiple metrics represent a stronger fingerprinting signal than queries for a single metric, implementations of this protocol may leak more information about the ALTO client than would occur with a succession of individual queries; although in many cases it would already be possible to link those queries by using the source IP address or other existing information. \"",
