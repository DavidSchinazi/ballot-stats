This document uses the normative keywords in the same ways as many other informational documents.  RFC 2119  is not focused on interoperability, but rather on the requirements that the specification using the keywords is laying out. (2) I don't think it is appropriate for this document to defined a new normative keyword, \"DEFAULT,\" in Section 1.1. The right place to do that would be an update to  RFC 2119  or  RFC 8174 . This is especially problematic given that the one place in this document where it is used, it is in a paragraph that also uses other normative keywords. Since it's only used once, I would suggest just explaining what it means in that location (3.2.2) rather than defining it as a keyword.",
