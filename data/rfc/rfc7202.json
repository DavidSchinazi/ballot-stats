Same answer in the section 4 \"RTP Session Establishment and Key Management\" \u00a0  The most important and widely used keying options for RTP sessions at \u00a0  the time of this writing are described in \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options ]. Therefore, I don't understand how the document content maps the second part of the abstract? (this point is my DISCUSS) \u00a0  Guidelines for designers and \u00a0  reviewers of future RTP extensions are provided, to ensure that \u00a0  appropriate security mechanisms are mandated, and that any such \u00a0  mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP \u00a0  architecture. I see \"guidelines\" in the section 6 title, but, as designer or reviewer, I'm not sure what the guidelines are. It seems the answer is always: \"it depends, see  draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options  as a starting point. \" I wonder why  draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-security-options-09  is not integrated in this document?",

        "text": "This document does a good job in building the case that SRTP is not universally fit as a security solution for all use cases of RTP. I have however a couple of issues with two sections in the document that I would like to be discussed before I can approve the document:  1. The last application scenario listed in Section 3 says:  >\u00a0 Finally, the link layer may be secure, and it may be known that the \u00a0  RTP media data is constrained to that single link (for example, when \u00a0  operating in a studio environment, with physical link security).\u00a0 An \u00a0  environment like this is inherently constrained, but might avoid the \u00a0  need for application, transport, or network layer media security. I do not believe that this is relevant in a discussion about securing an IETF protocol.  BCP 61  ( RFC 3365 ) Section 6 is very clear in that:  >\u00a0 One of the continuing arguments we hear against building security \u00a0  into protocols is the argument that a given protocol is intended only \u00a0  for use in \"protected\" environments where security will not be an \u00a0  issue. ... \u00a0  The solution is that we MUST implement strong security in all \u00a0  protocols to provide for the all too frequent day when the protocol \u00a0  comes into widespread use in the global Internet. I suggest to take out this case as irrelevant 2. I am confused about what section 5 tries to say. First I do not know the term 'framework protocol' - this needs to be defined or referred to. What the section seems to say is that for that category of protocols (where RTP belongs) the strong security is more an application issue, where an application may be built of several building blocks, out of which the protocol is only one of them. This seems again to question or even justify an extemption from the requirements of  BCP 61  [ RFC3365 ] for RTP or even a whole class of protocols.",

RTP itself however specifies a framework rather than a specific application, and given the variability described in this document, and the set of currently available mechanisms [ref] no one set of MTI security options can realistically be specified for all RTP applications. Existing RTP profiles [ref,ref] and payload formats [ref,ref] do not specify such an interoperable usage and are therefore neither secure in themselves, nor something to which  BCP66 applies. Future similar documents need to explicitly state this. Current work on real time web [ref] and SIP [ref] does however need to meet  BCP61  and therefore such documents need to specify MTI security. This is because such specifications do fully specify interoperable applications that use RTP.",

        "text": "This review is of version -10 of the draft.  This is definitely on the right track. 1. section 2 says that there's too much variation to pick a single MTI security or key mgmt scheme but I'm not convinced that all the variations would preclude that if taken individually, for example bandwidth is no big deal here, nor is realiability, in fact the only thing that really seems relevant for MTI security/key mgmt is multicast vs. point-to-point.\u00a0 if I'm right about the above then could we say that for RTP stacks that will mostly be used for point-to-point applications, then SRTP SHOULD be implemented so as to be usable for point-to-point applications? 2. Section 5, 1st para: Can you give a non-security example of what might cause non-interop for some use-cases? I mean where the two implementations couldn't work together for any configuration. (Which is what you're implying to justify that they security implementations can be non-interoperable.) 3. Last sentence of section 5 seems broken. Not sure I get what its saying either. 4. Section 6 - why can't you say that RTP profiles SHOULD specify MTI security? Surely if its possible then it ought be done, and if not then it cannot, which adds up to SHOULD. 5. Can you give an example of an RTP profile for which it does not make sense to specify MTI security? I think at least an existence proof is needed here.",
