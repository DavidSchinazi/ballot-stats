RFC 6532  and Section 10.1 of  RFC 6530  recommend using NFC Unicode Normalization Form. (This is similar to what IDN recommends, although there is no standard mapping there.) I think it would be reasonable for this document to say SHOULD apply NFC before hashing.",

On a second thought, there is no obvious place to put this text. Besides, the document disallows mangling of local-parts, so \"granting a limited right to interpret\" doesn't mean much other than \"this email address might exist\". I agree with this.
