        "text": "Roman's comment touched on a related point, but I'd like to (hopefully briefly) discuss the way we encode certain opaque protocol fields. There are some places where we clearly intend a hex representation (a string with a pattern that's marked out as pairs of hex digits), but there are others where we just say \"type string\" with no indication of encoding, and even a \"type binary\".\u00a0 If we want the specification to admit interoperable implementation we need to be more clear about what encoding we expect for all of these nodes.\u00a0 I have noted most (possibly all, but please double check) in the COMMENT section, with a preference for \"type binary\" where we don't need to apply regex restrictions.\u00a0 But that's just a personal preference, and choosing to use hex (or base64, or any other well-defined) encoding will suffice to resolve the discuss point.",
