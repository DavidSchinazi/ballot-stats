        "text": "The last time we had one of these \"SMTP extension with a header field to tunnel it through things that didn't know about the extension\" documents (SMTP PRIORITY), we rewrote it to be two separate documents: The SMTP extension as standards track, and the header field with tunneling instructions. I'd really like to understand why this wasn't done here. It seems to me that the header field is a complete hack, and has potential for screwing up content signatures when stripped, potentially unnecessarily revealing information to the end user, and standardizing it encourages trying to tunnel the message instead of bouncing it when the SMTP extension fails. - A lot of the considerations and problematic cases in this document are entirely because of the header field. If that was moved to its own document, the SMTP extension could be documented much more sanely. The document structure is a mess and hard to read because of all of the information regarding how to deal with the header field. - The header field is only necessary and useful when a relay server does not support the extension *and* when some other relay or delivery server does support the extension. Unlike the PRIORITY extension, where it is in the interest of both the sending and the receiving system to get the tunneled information, here the main interest lies with the sender. So if I want to use this as a sender, I probably want to make sure that the remote end actually supports it; if it doesn't, more likely than not I'd rather get the bounce and decide what to do rather than have it tunnelled and hear nothing if it's not implemented at the receiving end. And my understanding is that, for the most part, SMTP is not being used nowadays with a lot of uncontrolled relays in between source and receiver. So it seems like a hack to use the header field to tunnel when the message is likely to go from the sender (who presumably has implemented the extension) directly to the administrative domain of the recipient (for whom you would presume that there would not be intermediate relays that didn't implement the extension when the delivery agent does). - The document leaves open the question of whether to bounce the message or not when the extension is not supported. (It says \"RECOMMENDED\" to bounce.) That leaves the decision to the recipient. It seems much safer to make that decision the *sender's*. Why aren't there two extensions (or a parameter to the current extension) to allow the sender to express whether to bounce or to send it on even if it fails? That way, if the extension isn't there, the receiving server knows what to do, and the tunneling document could say, \"MUST NOT use this header field unless you know that the MDA supports RRVS.\" - Using the header field has the potential to leak information to the end user in a way that the extension simply can't. So not only will I get the message not intended to me, I'll also get information about the date that the old address was valid. I can't convince myself that there is a security problem here (would the sec folks like to take a shot?), but that seems like a handy piece of information to have for a social engineering attack. \"Hi, this is Murray. My email address is blah@blah. I created my account at your bank on April 1, 2010.\" Maybe it's not all that useful, but it worries me. But the extension has no such problem. I really think that the header field mechanism should, at a minimum, be moved to a separate document and described only as a tunneling mechanism. I'd rather see it go away completely, but I understand that people want that tunneling mechanism. I'm having a hard time reviewing the rest of this document with this issue outstanding. I'd like to hear what the authors think before I complete my review. (One specific review item: I think the document is not nearly strong enough on the question of multiple recipients. If an MSA or relay very close to the sender does the downgrade, thereby putting all of the recipients into the header of the message, you are potentially exposing lots of information to lots of people. I think this really needs to be a MUST NOT use the header field mechanism with multiple recipients.)",
