I'm looking at this text: 3.1. What does the Session Identifier Identify? \u00a0  How the endpoints determine which signaling messages share a given \u00a0  identifier (that is, what constitutes a single invocation of a \u00a0  communication application) is intentionally left loosely defined. \u00a0  The requirements in this document put some constraints on what an \u00a0  endpoint will consider the same, or a different, invocation of a \u00a0  communication session.\u00a0 They also ensure that related sessions (as \u00a0  this document is using the term) can be correlated using only the \u00a0  session identifiers for each session.\u00a0 Again, what constitutes a \u00a0  \"related\" session is intentionally left loosely defined. as saying pretty much \"a session is whatever I say it is\", and I'm looking at this text: 3.2. Communication Session \u00a0  The following are examples of acceptable communication sessions as \u00a0  described in Section 3.1 and are by not exhaustive: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ^^ typo? but that's not my point \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call directly between two user agents \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call between two user agents with one or more SIP middleboxes \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  in the signaling path \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call between two user agents that was initiated using third- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  party call control (3PCC) [7] \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call between two user agents (e.g., between Alice and Carol) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  that results from a different communication session (e.g., Alice \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  and Bob) wherein one of those user agents (Alice) is transferred \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  to another user agent (Carol) using a REFER request or a re- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  INVITE request \u00a0  The following are not considered communication sessions: \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call between any two user agents wherein two or more user \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  agents are engaged in a conference call via a conference focus: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o each call between the user agent and the conference focus \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  would be a communication session, and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o each of these is a distinct communication session. \u00a0 \u00a0  o A call between three user agents (e.g., Alice, Bob, and Carol) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  wherein the first user agent (Alice) ad hoc conferences the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  other two user agents (Bob and Carol) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o The call between Alice and Bob would be one communication \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  session. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o The call between Alice and Carol would be a different \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  communication session. which gives *examples* of what is, and is not, a session, but I'm not seeing a clear description that would let me figure out whether a call that doesn't fit one of these categories is a session, and the text says the examples aren't exhaustive. Are these two lists of examples, taken together, just saying \"any call with exactly two endpoints can be a session, and a call with any other number of endpoints can't be a session\"? Is there any other requirement? Am I missing something?",

(2): I assume that the solution draft will contain more privacy considerations related to the use and storage of these identifiers, however, you say here that they are to be usable days or weeks after a call, so don't you also need to say that a solution needs to describe the security and privacy issues related to storage of identifiers?
