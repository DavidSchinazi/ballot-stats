In 6.\u00a0 Securing Communication, I'm reading \u00a0  With a RELOAD HIP BONE, instead of using TLS connections as defined \u00a0  in [ I-D.ietf-p2psip-base ], all HIP overlay messages SHOULD be either \u00a0  sent using encrypted connections (such as IPsec ESP tunnel between \u00a0  two peers [ RFC6261 ]) or the contents of the messages SHOULD be in an \u00a0  ENCRYPTED parameter (see Section 5.2.15 of [ RFC5201 ]).\u00a0 Use of \u00a0  encrypted connections is RECOMMENDED since that provides \u00a0  confidentiality also for the HIP headers. as roughly  \u00a0  you SHOULD use encrypted connections,  \u00a0 \u00a0  but that might not happen, and if you don't,  \u00a0 \u00a0  you SHOULD use an ENCRYPTED parameter,  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  but that might not happen, either If I didn't mess that up ... I'm reading 11.\u00a0 Security Considerations \u00a0  The option to send overlay messages unencrypted makes it possible for \u00a0  hosts that are not part of the overlay to inspect the contents of the \u00a0  messages and thus should be avoided when possible. and I'm wondering why the specification creates an option and then says that option should be avoided when possible.  Could you say anything to help the reader understand why at least the payloads, and maybe even the HIP headers, might be sent \"in the clear\"?  Would a sending application know when a payload could be sent \"in the clear\"?  Would a HIP overlay know what payloads could safely be sent \"in the clear\"?",
