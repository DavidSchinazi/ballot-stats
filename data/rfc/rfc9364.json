I'm all for advancing the RFC set that makes up DNSSEC along the standards track, but BCP it not part of that track. Publishing a BCP that normatively references some DNSSEC RFCs isn't doing anything in terms of moving them forward. ### Section 1.1, paragraph 2 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  The DNSSEC set of protocols is the best current practice for adding \u00a0 \u00a0  origin authentication of data in the DNS.\u00a0 To date, no standards- \u00a0 \u00a0  track RFCs offer any other method for such origin authentication of \u00a0 \u00a0  data in the DNS. ``` Just because no other standards track RFCs compete with DNSSEC does not mean it is a BCP. A BCP is something else, i.e. \"The BCP subseries of the RFC series is designed to be a way to standardize practices and the results of community deliberations.\" [ RFC2026 ] ### Section 1.1, paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  However, this low level of implementation does not affect whether \u00a0 \u00a0  DNSSEC is a best current practice; it just indicates that the value \u00a0 \u00a0  of deploying DNSSEC is often considered lower than the cost. ``` Protocols aren't BCPs. HTTP isn't the \"best current practice\" for transporting HTML either.",

To add a reference that RFCXXX updates the GOST algorithms for DNSSEC (but that it is uncertain at this point whether it will be widely adopted) I could be convinced for this document to not wait, but then I do think this paragraph should state that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to implement  RFC5933  since the underlying GOST algorithms have been deprecated by its issuer.",
