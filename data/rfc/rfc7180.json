        "text": "The following points are derived from the RTG-DIR review by Mike Shand. === Section 2.1 states \"Frames are not least cost routed through an overloaded TRILL Switch if any other path is available...\" However, ISO/IEC precludes the routing of frames through an overloaded router, even when no other path is available. (see clause 7.2.8.1) [ note all references to ISO/IEC 10589 are to the second edition ] Please clarify in the text that there is no intention for TRILL to  deviate from the specified\u00a0 ISO/IEC 10589 behaviour. === Section 2.3.1 seems relevant here, but I don't understand the description. I must be missing something, since it would appear that a data frame forwarded to RB2 MUST attempt to forward the frame to ANY non-overloaded neighbor (other than the one it was received from). However, surely that non overloaded neighbor might then have RB2 as its next hop, and forward the frame back to RB2, which would then be required to forward the frame possibly back to the original RBridge from which it was received. Clearly this is not the desired operation, so the text needs clarifying to make it clear what is really supposed to happen. === Section 4 bullet 4 I THINK this is saying that the check must be made on any \"new\" LSP even if the RBridge is in overload state, and cannot store the received \"new\" LSP.\u00a0 It may be clearer to explicitly say it must do this even when overloaded.\u00a0 The existing parenthetical remark doesn't seem adequate. === The following issue was raised: \u00a0  Section 5 2nd para \u00a0  I don't understand the term \"refragment LSPs\". \u00a0  Is this saying that an RBridge may start with some value of \u00a0  originatingL1LSPBufferSize, and then be required to change to a \u00a0  lower value, thus necessitating that it re-generates all its LSPs  \u00a0  which were previously larger than this new value? In a subsequent discussion with the reviewer the a some clarification was provided. Please add this clarification to the text.  === Section 2.2 second para \"...and Bridge RB1 can similarly....\" Can is ambiguous. Is that MAY or MUST?",
