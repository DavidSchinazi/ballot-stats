        "text": "I don't understand how this document is appropriate for standards track. It strikes me as almost entirely Informational. Sections 1 & 2 are introductory and definitional. Section 3 lays out the use case categories, but doesn't introduce any new protocol. It simply points to sections 4, 5, and 6. Section 4 says that it is only describing the regulatory environment, and section 6 describes itself as non-normative. In fact, it's not clear to me why the discussions in section 4 & 6 are within charter for the WG. The only \"normative\" text in this document appears in section 5, but it does not appear to me to be normative with regard to protocol. For example: 5.1.1.\u00a0 LoST Server Discovery \u00a0  The end host MUST discover a LoST server [ RFC5222 ] using DHCP \u00a0  [ RFC5223 ]. 5.1.2.\u00a0 ESRP Discovery \u00a0  The end host MUST discover the ESRP using the LoST protocol \u00a0  [ RFC5222 ]. \u00a0   As far as I know, both of those are technically not true. An end host could just as easily have a pre-configured LoST server for these purposes, or might discover the ESRP out of band. There is no protocol requirement for these steps. There *may* be a policy/regulatory reason to perform those steps, but that's not a proper part of a standards track protocol document, certainly not with \"MUST\" in front of them. If the claim is that a host MUST do these things in order to be compliant with 6881, that's also not a proper use of \"MUST\", and is not a protocol requirement. In it's strongest interpretation, this section is all operational guidance, not appropriate for standards track. But overall, I think this document should be Informational, and the \"normative\" language should be removed.",
