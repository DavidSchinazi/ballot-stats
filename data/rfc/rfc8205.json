        "text": "I have a couple of fairly straightforward things I'd like to briefly discuss... (1) 3.2/Figure 7: A fixed 20 byte SKI being a sha-1 hash of the public key is a bad plan, for all the usual reasons. Why is it ok for that to be hardcoded here when it could change if/when new alg choices are made for the RPKI? If it is not too late then I think you should add a length or alg field to that. If it is too late to do that, then are we really ok that you will need to rev the BGPsec version number in order to get rid of all sha-1 code from your implementation? That seems like a bad plan for a new protocol. (2) Figure 8: It seems to me to be an error to omit the signer's ASN from the signed data and only have that included in the signer's certificate. Why is that intimate level of binding to the RPKI desirable? There may well be reasons but I'm not seeing 'em, and I am recalling that it took a chunk of effort to make CMS less dependent on X.509 for similar reasons (meaning identifying signers exclusively via cert issuer and serial in that case).\u00a0 I would expect that there could be demand to have some level of independence between BGPsec and RPKI for at least internal uses such as those noted in the spec already. (3) section 8: Is there a potential exposure here in that a relying party who emits e.g.\u00a0 certificate status checks or cert retrieval queries for an RPKI cert they've not previously seen is exposing something about the set of paths its traffic is likely to follow. (This is similar to why we have OCSP stapling in the web.) IIRC the RPKI specs may cover this but I suspect it'd be worth noting here as well even if so as this represents exposing something about BGP announcement content to off-path parties which I think is new for BGP. Is that a new thing for BGP? (I think the new aspect to the attack is that a bad actor who has already compromised some AS could more easily spot that traffic from the relying party's AS is likely to transit the compromised AS.)",
