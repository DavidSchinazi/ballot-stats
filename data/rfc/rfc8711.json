So for a number of reasons, a one-year term makes more sense, perhaps with text encouraging reappointment for two or three years, would be better (along with appropriate changes to term limits in 6.5 to specify years rather than terms).\u00a0 Did the working group specifically discuss and reject this?\u00a0 Or was it just aligned to the IETF Chair\u2019s term without giving consideration to these points?",

As the IETF community does not appear to have a definition, it is not possible to determine if IRTF is counted as part of the IETF community or not.
