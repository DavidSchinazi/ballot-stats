One item I'd like to discuss though.\u00a0 From Section 3.1.1: \u201cOn one end of the spectrum, one might argue that an SF is sufficiently available if the service node (physical or virtual) hosting the SF is available and is functional.\u00a0 On the other end of the spectrum, one might argue that the SF's availability can only be concluded if the packet, after passing through the SF, was examined and it was verified that the packet did indeed get the expected service.\u201d I found this a bit surprising, especially given the critical nature of many SF functions.\u00a0 Why would it ever be the case that, say, \u201cwell, the hypervisor says the VM is up, so the SF is up\u201d is a safe conclusion?\u00a0 For such a critical component, I would expect only some more complete test is necessary to conclude availability of the SF.\u00a0 Shouldn't we at least be pushing implementers toward the latter end of that spectrum?",
