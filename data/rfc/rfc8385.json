Having watched many TRILL documents go by in the last 4 years, we didn't push too hard on security in some cases as a result of the restriction to a campus network.\u00a0 This particular document extends into multi-tenancy where there are certainly security considerations introduced to be able to provide isolation properties.\u00a0 MPLS offers no security and it is being used to join TRILL campuses as described int his draft.\u00a0 This is done without any requirement of an overlay protocol to provide security - why is that the case?\u00a0 Minimally, the considerations need to be explained.\u00a0 Ideally, a solution should be offered to protect tenants when TRILL campuses are joined.",
