The appropriate thing to do here is to say something like \"as described in Section Y of [RFC XXXX], a node that does not support the Availability TLV will [behave in this fashion]\", with no normative language.\u00a0 (Also, the  RFC 2205  reference is not very helpful to me; as far as I can tell it is just providing information about how to encode a PathErr but does not tell me anything about the specific error code and value indicated.) I'll also hold a placeholder discuss point to wait for the [IEEE754] reference for the floating-point format.\u00a0 (I think that format is not a great fit for this application, for many of the reasons that Magnus notes, but  RFC 8330  has kind of forced us into keeping it.)",
