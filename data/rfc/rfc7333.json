My concern about this document is that it's making a change to the way mobile IP is done that I think is a very good change, but I don't think it's going far enough.\u00a0  I think that with some relatively small changes, this could be stating requirements for a mobile IP architecture that works well in the currently intended environment, but also allows for a permissionless mode of operation\u2014that is, allows at least some more intelligent mobile devices to participate in the mobile architecture even when they connect to a network that is not operated by their mobile operator, and that has no formal agreement to interoperate with their mobile operator's mobility infrastructure. This is important for two reasons.\u00a0  First of all, it allows for greater utility for the mobile device when it is in a location where the mobile operator provides no service, or provides poorer service than is available on a local non-affiliated WLAN.\u00a0  Second, it creates an opportunity for lock-in, where by offering better service on the affiliated network than is available on a non-affiliated network, the customer will be motivated to switch wireline providers, and possibly to set up their home network in a way that isn't in their overall best interests in order to accommodate the mobile provider's mobility infrastructure. To address this DISCUSS, what I am asking for is a change to REQ5 as follows. OLD: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 protocols.\u00a0 Furthermore, a DMM solution SHOULD work across \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 different networks, possibly operated as separate \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 administrative domains, when allowed by the trust relationship \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between them. NEW: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 protocols.\u00a0 Furthermore, a DMM solution SHOULD work across \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 different networks, possibly operated as separate \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 administrative domains, when allowed by the trust relationship \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between them. REQ5a: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In cases where there is no trust relationship \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between administrative domains, it should still be possible \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 for a node to authenticate to its provider's mobility infrastructure \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 so that it can offer mobility service to applications that require it. REQ5b: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When roaming on networks for which there is no relationship \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between administrative domains, some services such as QoS \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 may not be achievable using DMM signaling.\u00a0  A DMM solution \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 should specify a fallback mechanism for providing QoS when \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 it is required (e.g. for emergency service) and the provider \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 network is available, even if the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 non-affiliated WLAN is being used for offload.
