It is completely unclear that there will be a list of requirements at the end of the story (hence part of Spencer's Comment). 2. The actual problem statement section contains far more historical context than actual statement of a problem. 3. Sections 4.x could easily be condensed into a concise (and readable) bulleted list. 4. Sections 5.x do not need long-winded descriptions of the current solutions.\u00a0 A reference will do. I think the document would be much more useful in a condensed format.\u00a0 However, since the WG has consensus on this formulation, I am not going to stand in the way.",
