How does the MUST for tls-unique values from the 1st TLS session in 3.5 work with re-direction? I suspect that you need to either work out how 3xx responses are done or else explain it a bit more to me, because I didn't get that it works now. (3) 3.6.1: what does check \"against\" mean? Don't you need to say more, e.g. URI has to be in a SAN of a TA or something? (Similar question for 3.6.2.)
