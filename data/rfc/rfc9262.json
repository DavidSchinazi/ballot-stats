From the first line of the introduction: \"BIER-TE is based on architecture, terminology and packet formats with \u00a0  BIER as described in [ RFC8279 ] and [ RFC8296 ]. Both  RFC 8279  and  RFC 8296  are experimental RFCs, hence (1) I wanted to check that by publishing this draft as Std Track, that this draft isn't being built on an unstable footing. This draft has a normative reference to  RFC 8279 , but only an informative reference to  RFC 8296 . Hence, I further wanted to check: (2) Should  RFC 8296  really be a normative reference? (3) The IETF LC announcement didn't seem to flag the downref to  RFC 8279 .\u00a0  RFC 8067  says that is not strictly required, but in this case I think that would have been useful. I can see from the document history that the WG has flip-flopped on whether this document should be experimental or stds track, but I couldn't quickly find this discussion, and it wasn't covered in shepherds writeup.\u00a0 If it is possible for someone to provide a quick summary as to why it is okay and right to publish this as standards track that would be appreciated.",
