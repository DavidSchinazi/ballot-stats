Please explain. C: The way that a resolver signals to a client that it has performed validation (and that the answer validated) is to set a single bit (AD) in the response - this is obviously something which should not be relied upon for security sensitive stuff - I'd strongly suggest that i) there be some text around getting the responses from the resolver to the CA machine securely (e.g over DNS-over-TLS), or better yet ii) that the CA machine itself do the DNSSEC validation - there are many libraries / systems to make this easy, e.g Stubby, libunbound, etc.  2: \"A domain can use this property to protect itself from the threat posed by a global adversary capable of performing man-in-the-middle attacks, ...\" A: What is the purpose of \"global\" in \"global adversary\" -- I'm assuming it is trying to communicate something important here, but how is this different to a \"local\" adversary capable of performing man-in-the-middle attacks? 3: \" Use of the \"accounturi\" or \"validationmethods\" parameters does not confer additional security against an attacker capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack against all validation attempts made by a given CA which is authorized by CAA where: \u00a0  1.\u00a0 A domain does not secure its nameservers using DNSSEC, or \u00a0  2.\u00a0 That CA does not perform CAA validation using a trusted DNSSEC-validating resolver. Moreover, use of the \"accounturi\" or \"validationmethods\" parameters does not mitigate against man-in-the-middle attacks against CAs which do not validate CAA records, or which do not do so using a trusted DNSSEC-validating resolver, ...\" Can this document simply say: \"When using this method, CA's MUST use a DNSSEC-validating resolver\"? -- it will a: make the protocol more secure and b: simplify a bunch of the document and c: isn't a large burden.  During the so-called \"DNSpionage\" incident, it seems that a specific CA was chosen because it didn't do DNSSEC validation (or, perhaps would try validate, but would still issue if DNSSEC validation failed) -- see:  https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-March/099852.html",
