        "text": "This isn't my only concern with this document but Warren Kumari has broadly covered the space with his own DISCUSS.\u00a0 I did want to highlight this one, though.\u00a0 I think it should be relatively easy to fix. Section 4.6, \"Securing the Control Channel\", almost-mandates security: ``` \u00a0  The control channel between the HNA and the DM MUST be secured at \u00a0  both the HNA and the DM. ``` It does not, however, specify any mandatory-to-implement security mechanism, although it provides an interesting and wide-ranging discussion of many options.\u00a0 It's very difficult for me to see how interoperable implementations can be built, that comply with the quoted requirement, by someone working from the current specification. It does seem from other hints in the document that the authors consider TLS mandatory even though it's not stated as such in Section 4.6. For example, Security Considerations subsection 12.1 says, ``` \u00a0  The channels between HNA and DM are mutually authenticated and \u00a0  encrypted with TLS [ RFC8446 ] and its associated security \u00a0  considerations apply.  ``` Another hint that TLS is viewed as mandatory-to-implement is from a different document also currently under review,  draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options-21  (Sections 4.2 and 4.3): ``` \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The bit for DNS over TLS [ RFC7858 ] MUST be set. ``` I talk about this more in my comment on Section 4.6, but there's just no way to read this paragraph as mandating TLS: ``` \u00a0  Secure protocols (like TLS [ RFC8446 ]) SHOULD be used to secure the \u00a0  transactions between the DM and the HNA. ``` It doesn't even quite mandate secure transport in general, since it's a SHOULD (so presumably there are times when an implementor can sensibly ignore it, though these are not discussed). What's more, TLS is only given as an example of one transport that would be OK, not as the mandatory-to-implement secure transport. As written, any secure transport, for example TCP-AO, would satisfy this SHOULD. Based on the hints throughout the rest of the document set, that the authors think of TLS as the mandatory-to-implement base transport, I think this section should be rewritten to match that expectation.",

It renames a bunch of DNS terms (hidden primary, primary, seconday, AXFR/IXFR, DNS update --> HNA, DM, DOI, Control Channel, Sync channel) which makes the document very hard to read. For those parts where protocol glue is needed to use these DNS technologies, the document presents no solutions. I don't understand if users can create their own named zones, or whether this is only provider generated zones. The latter seems less useful to the user, the former seems to need more specification on how to handle registry/registrar/registrant matters (especially with respect to DS) The security seems to mix up transport security with TLS and data integrity security of the DNS protocol (typically TSIG or SIG0, but the document claims this cannot be used) Having provider generated homenet named DNS zones makes scanning for hostnames in those zones much easier than scanning an entire /64 IPv6 for vulnerable devices. Eg well known host names like \"tv\" or \"LG\" or \"washing_machine\" or just any <= 8 character string based hostnames or dictionary attacks. Like Warren, I've added my notes as comments without splitting them further into DISCUSSes or COMMENTs",

The repeated clarifications with primary/secondary also makes the document much easier to read. I have a few discuss items left to resolve. Other than the Document Status also raised by others, I think the DISCUSSes should be easy to resolve. #1 Document Status As other ADs have pointed out, Standards Track would not be the right intended status. Experimental would be a much better fit. I understand this is done because otherwise 3gpp won't consider the document, but whether the IETF should make its decisions based on that is something I'd like to discuss with the other members of the IESG.  #2 Security Considerations for DM/DOI missing There is no Security Considerations paragraph for the DM/DOI ? For example, if I want to use \" ietf.org \" for my Public Homenet  Zone, that should probably not be allowed to be served by the ISPs DM/DOI infrastructure. Similarly, currently non-existing domains like \" mailietf.org \" or TLDs should probably not be allowed. When allowing subdomains of existing registrations, perhaps it can recommend the DM/DOI does a verification check, eg via  draft-ietf-dnsop-domain-verification-techniques #3 Conveying the name of the zone to use \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The HNA builds the Public Homenet Zone based on a template that is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 returned by the DM to the HNA.\u00a0 Section 6.5 explains how this \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 leverages the AXFR mechanism. If it uses AXFR, I guess the name itself cannot be part of the template and has to be handled differently. Unless it would use DNS catalog zones, eg draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-catalog-zones. Information on how to convey the name to be used as Public Homenet Zone should be added to Section 6.1. #4 HNA IP address \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a result, the HNA must provide the IP address the DM should use to reach the HNA. Note there is an odd lowercase \"must\" here, which becomes stranger when later on it states: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By default, the IP address used by the HNA in the Control Channel \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is considered by the DM and the explicit specification of the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IP by the HNA is only OPTIONAL. So it seems the HNA doesn't need to \"must provide\", as its IP as visible by the DM/DOI is used anyway and providing it (explicitly) is deemed OPTIONAL ?",

If so, please explicitly state the use of DoT with normative language -- \"DNS over TLS (DoT) MUST be used for ...\" -- If so, this suggests to me that all traffic is over TLS.\u00a0 This text doesn\u2019t align with the Section 4.6\u2019s weaker guidance that \u201c[s]ecure protocols (like TLS [ RFC8446 ]) SHOULD be used to secure the transactions between the DM and the HNA\u201d as the text in this section does not make for allowance for anything beyond DoT. ** Section 4.6.\u00a0 Thanks for discussing the flexible deployment options in section.\u00a0 My concern is that the mandatory to implement security properties are not sufficiently specified for an interoperable solution.\u00a0 The statement \u201cThe control channel between the HNA and the DM MUST be secured at both the HNA and the DM\u201d is helpful.\u00a0 How does one conform to it?\u00a0 What exact security properties are required (MUST)? Various text hints at these properties: (a) Section 3.2 said that HNA and DM communication uses DoT (no normative language) (b) Section 3.2, \u201cit is RECOMMENDED to use TLS with mutually authentication based on certificates to secure the channel between the HNA and the DM.\u201d (c) Section 4.5, \u201c The provisioning process SHOULD provide a method of securing the Control Channel, so that the content of messages can be\u00a0 \u00a0 authenticated.\u201d (d) Section 4.6, \u201cSecure protocols (like TLS) SHOULD ...\u201d be used (e) Section 4.6., \u201cHNA SHOULD authenticate inbound connections from the DM \u2026\u201d (f)\u00a0 Section 4.6., \u201cDM SHOULD authenticate the HNA \u2026 Even assuming DoT is a MUST (which is not stated), all of these statements are SHOULD or RECOMMENDED suggesting that the HNA might not need to authenticate to the DM.  ** Section 12.1.\u00a0 \u00a0   The channels between HNA and DM are mutually authenticated and \u00a0  encrypted with TLS [ RFC8446 ] and its associated security \u00a0  considerations apply.\u00a0  I would recommend this design.\u00a0 Where is this stated in a normative fashion?\u00a0 The text in Section 4.6 and 5.1 states that mutual authentication is a SHOULD. (2) Why would internal clients have to use public DNS for internal services given that there is an authoritative server for the Homenet Zone in the internal network? ** Section 1.3 \u00a0  When the resolution is performed from within the home network, the \u00a0  Homenet DNSSEC Resolver MAY proceed similarly.\u00a0  I\u2019m not sure if this my misreading of the behavior of internal clients.\u00a0 To clarify, the (internal) Homenet DNSSEC Resolver will \u201c... resolves the DS record on the Global DNS and the name associated to the Public Homenet Zone (myhome.example) on the Public Authoritative Servers.\u201d?\u00a0 Why would the internal resolver serving a request for an internal client for an internal service go to the Global DNS if the information if it could come from the internal Homenet Zone it is already configured with?\u00a0 As an operational consideration, why go outside of the network if you don\u2019t need to?\u00a0 As a privacy consideration, why leak the request to an outside entity if the network already has the information.",
