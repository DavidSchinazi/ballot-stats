        "text": "(1) Given the two key security threats identified in Section 11 -- that authorized nodes can issue requests with artificially high priority in order to get better treatment, and that unauthorized intermediaries can modify the priorities that senders set -- I don't see how it is legitimate to claim that either 5.1 or 5.2 are appropriate use cases for DRMP. The spec seems to assume that this mechanism will only be used in scenarios where nodes and agents have some out-of-band trust relationship established with each other (the shepherd write-up talks about a \"trusted environment\"), but that is certainly not the case in many disaster and emergency scenarios. If that really is a limitation on the scope of applicability of this mechanism, that should be stated in the document, and those use cases should either be removed or modified to explain the limitations on their applicability.\u00a0  (2) Section 6 says: \t\u00a0  \"The mechanism for how the agent determines which requests are \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  throttled is implementation dependent and is outside the scope of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  this document.\" How is a node supposed to determine how to set its priorities if each agent makes implementation-specific decisions about what those priorities mean? I understood the document to be saying that Diameter applications would have to define what he priority levels mean within their own contexts, but then I would have expected the interpretation of priorities amongst all nodes and agents implementing the same application to be the same.  (3) Section 8 says:  \t\"Diameter nodes SHOULD use the PRIORITY_10 priority as this default value.\" \u00a0   If the determination of the priority schemes are all application-specific, how is it appropriate for this spec to define what the default priority should be for all applications? Shouldn't applications specify their own defaults?",

        "text": "I have a few concerns that I think need some discussion.  1) Priority between applications: The fact that agents can apply priority for messages from multiple applications without knowledge of those applications seems dangerous. Let's say application A is a critical infrastructure application, and application B is not. But clients for application B might set requests to have a higher priority than do clients for application A.\u00a0 Further, application B could become a DoS vector for application A. One potential (and likely half-baked) way to mitigate this would be to say that nodes that are not \"application aware\" can only apply priority among messages for the same application. 2) Priority between clients of the same application: If you have multiple clients for the same application, don't they need to use the same prioritization strategy? How is this to be managed? 3) Out of order requests: The draft explicitly allows agents to re-route and even explicitly re-order messages. Is it safe to have a non-application aware node change the order of messages? 4) I am nervous about the idea that clients and servers would use a generic message priority mechanism to manage the allocation of resources that result from a requests and answers. It seems like that should be based on application specific rules and information. (Now, if the point is that these same AVPs might be used in an application according to application specific rules, that might be okay--but then you might run into issues where application-agnostic agents don't know the difference.)",
