What's the point of this draft if you don't register the applications that can use this protocol? I was expecting a registry with the different capabilities. - DISCUSS Below is Scott Bradner's OPS Directorate review (part 1) This is an OPS_DIR review of draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-06. The ID describes using the MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh ) to permit an LSP endpoint to inform other LSP endpoints of information of its choosing. The specification is not all that detailed and leaves most of the actual functionality to the applications that wish to exchange information over the G-Ach. Unlike most IDs this one includes a \" Managability Considerations\" - having such a section is great concept - but this example is not all that useful.\u00a0 The section provides a number of MUSTs but does not provide justification for them - it would help the implementers and operators if there were some additional information provided to say why the MUSTs are MUSTs.\u00a0 This type of thing is also a problem (a more important one imo) in section 3 which includes SHALL NOT and MUST NOT but does not say why such a prohibition is important.\u00a0 The authors know how to provide such context, they do so in section 5.1, it would be help if they did the same wherever they insist that something MUST be done or MUST NOT be done.",

        "text": "No general objection about this document except that the any impact of congestion is not mentioned and not handled.  1) Congestion Control issues: First a question: Can the GACH take all of the capacity of the link or at least of the share of the link of the associated data channel?  Second question:\u00a0 What is the capacity of such a GACH in general? Now the issues in detail: Section 2., paragraph 11: >\u00a0 \u00a0 The rate at which GAP messages are transmitted is at the discretion >\u00a0 \u00a0 of the sender, and may fluctuate over time as well as differ per >\u00a0 \u00a0 application.\u00a0 Each message contains, for each application it >\u00a0 \u00a0 describes, a lifetime that informs the receiver how long to wait >\u00a0 \u00a0 before discarding the data for that application. This is error prone, as the sender can send GAP messages at a high rate, potentially congest the link and cause also damage to other applications. Especially, if multiple applications send their GAP messages at the same time, for whatever reason.  Section 5.1., paragraph 8: >\u00a0 \u00a0 In some cases an application may desire additional reliability for >\u00a0 \u00a0 the delivery of some of its data.\u00a0 When this is the case, the >\u00a0 \u00a0 transmitter MAY send several (for example three) instances of the >\u00a0 \u00a0 message in succession, separated by a delay appropriate to, or >\u00a0 \u00a0 specified by, the application.\u00a0 For example this procedure might be >\u00a0 \u00a0 invoked when sending a flush instruction following device reset.\u00a0 The >\u00a0 \u00a0 expectation is that the receiver will detect duplicate messages using >\u00a0 \u00a0 the MI.  This looks like a potential issue in terms of multiple applications intend to send burst of data. \u00a0 I can see the goal to have some sort of reliability in GAP message delivery, but sending a burst of data (i.e., three in a row is a burst) will cause trouble at some point.   In general, it might look easy to avoid any congestion control in this setting, but I can see that this lack of congestion control is putting the GACH at risk due to an overload situation.  2) Timing issue: Section 3., paragraph 13: >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Message Identifier (MI): Unique identifier of this message.\u00a0 A >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  sender MUST NOT re-use an MI over a given channel until the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  message lifetime has expired.\u00a0 The sole purpose of this field is >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  duplicate detection in the event of a message burst (Section 5.1). Does this mean that the sender can immediately reuse the MI after the timer has expired at the sender's side? If yes, there is the chance for a race condition, as the receiver side might not yet have expired the timer. I would propose to add some safety margin, i.e., so it the MI is expired on both sides.",

        "text": "First, thanks for section 6. It was a nice surprise and is nearly but not quite there:-) I hope these discuss points will be easily resolved. (1) 6.1: Why is there no mandatory to implement HMAC hash function? Without that, you won't get interop. I suggest making HMAC-SHA256 MTI. HMAC-SHA1 would also be ok. (I'd also suggest just deleting the other options unless you've a specific reason to want them here.) (2) 9: How do you know that application specific data won't require confidentiality? I can imagine keys being sent using this, as has been done in Diameter. If you don't want to define a confidentiality service then I suggest that you say that application or GAP TLVs that require confidentiality (such as cryptographic keys) MUST NOT be sent in clear using the GAP protocol because someone will write a draft that does just that otherwise.  (3) 6.1: If using karp key tables, how do the SendNotBefore, SendNotAfter and similar values from that map to the Timestamp+Lifetime used here? I think you need to say as implementers will make different assumptions otherwise. (I don't care much which of the reasonable options you choose.) (4) 6.2: you need to say what is in the V for the auth data TLV as input to HMAC. Options are to include L zeros as the value or for the V octets to be missing on input to HMAC.
