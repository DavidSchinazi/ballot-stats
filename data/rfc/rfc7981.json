Section 3 says: \u00a0  Where a receiving system has two copies of a CAPABILITY TLV from the \u00a0  same system that have different settings for a given attribute, the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \u00a0  procedure used to choose which copy shall be used is undefined. The word \"attribute\" only occurs once in the document, so it would be better if it is replaced for clarity. Does \"a given attribute\" mean \"a single sub-TLV\" or \"all sub-TLVs included in a CAPABILITY TLV instance\"? If \"a given attribute\" means \"a single sub-TLV\", then I have the following followup questions: What happens in real world if there are two CAPABILITY TLVs which contain different attributes? Are they treated as cumulative (i.e. this is a nice trick to overcome CAPABILITY TLV length limit), does the second CAPABILITY\u00a0 TLV value always overrides earlier instances of the CAPABILITY TLV? I think the document should state what happens. If there is no consistent behaviour in this area, the document should says so as well.",

I think this inconsistency needs to be resolved somehow.  P.S.: One possible way would be to add some exception text for the D bit into the above text in Section 4.
