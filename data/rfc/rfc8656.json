I think I'm confused about whether REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY and ADDITIONAL-ADDRESS-FAMILY are mutually exclusive.\u00a0 Does sending just the \"additional\" one secretly mean that you want both v4 and v6? Section 5 I see that the secdir reviewer asked about why it is a \"SHOULD\" to send SOFTWARE, and only got a response that it is defined in stunbis, but not about why it is recommended.\u00a0 There remain some privacy/security considerations with it, and we should either point to the stunbis security considerations or not recommend using it.\u00a0 (FINGERPRINT is, IIRC, less interesting from a security perspective as it's just about confirming that given traffic is in fact STUN and not something else.) Section 12 Do we need to say anything about backwards compatibility with  RFC 5766 peers that use a wider range of channel IDs? Section 12.7 \u00a0  When the server receives an ICMP packet, the server processes it as \u00a0  described in Section 11.5.\u00a0 A Data indication MUST be sent regardless \u00a0  of whether there is a channel bound to the peer that was the \u00a0  destination of the UDP datagram that triggered the reception of the \u00a0  ICMP packet. This MUST seems potentially in conflict with the previous discussion about permissions checks in Section 11.5. Section 20 Looking at the new nonce in the example (\"obMatJos2AAABadl7W7PeDU4hKE72jda\"), and noting that it starts with the nonce cookie, help me decode the security feature bits.\u00a0 The magic prefix is \"obMatJos2\" so the capability bits are encoded as \"AAAB\", which decodes to (hex) 00 00 01.\u00a0 But stunbis says that the bits are ordered from 0 (MSB of first byte) to 23 (LSB of last byte), so this would have bit 23 set, which is in contrast to the registry marking bit 0 as the password-algorithms feature.\u00a0 Where am I messing this up? I'd prefer if the examples showed more usage of MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 (especially, any from the server) and fewer MESSAGE-INTEGRITY.",

This draft says in section 5 (as  RFC5766  does): \"The server MUST demand that all requests \u00a0  from the client be authenticated using this mechanism, or that a \u00a0  equally strong or stronger mechanism for client authentication is \u00a0  used.\" However,  RFC 8155  which is even now cited in this draft, updates  RFC5766  and relaxes this requirement. Later in the section 7.2. this draft says: \"The server SHOULD require that the request be authenticated.\" I assume the requirement in section 5 is an oversight?  I also recommend to only specify this requirement normatively in one place.",
