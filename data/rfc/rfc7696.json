I'll switch to a Yes once we have a clearer answer as to where we are on consensus for the paragraph in Section 2.9.\u00a0 I know there is similar text in the OS RFC and the discussion was had with mail operators around another RFC, but I don't think there was an adequate discussion on this topic with the fuller audience.\u00a0 The discussion never happened with the OS RFC and Viktor had some assumptions that are clear on mailing lists in recent threads, but not necessarily in that document or discussions for that document.\u00a0  The mail/applications discussion was specific to a use case of software that had no plans for upgrades, which results in legacy systems using older selections for transport encryption (fine, we can deal with that and just say it's legacy).\u00a0 This discussion didn't involve the SAAG or per pass list and was spurred on by the RC4 deprecation ( RFC7435 ).\u00a0 I think whatever statements we make on this going forward should be derived from some level of consensus or we risk demonstrating consensus in a series of published documents that I don't think we really have. I'm happy to be in the rough on this, but do want to wait on the outcome of the discussion and see if text for this section requires updating. Here is the question I sent to the list and I also prodded on the perpass list to chime in on this thread. https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/PXrRghfHM-OBj2Y2TniuKptpKCs I'm happy to wait to see what happens with this thread and what statements are deemed appropriate.",
