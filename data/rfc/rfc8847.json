I have a few concerns that I think require discussion prior to publication: \u00a75.7: Is the \"description\" field expected to be human readable? If so, are there internationalization issues to consider? \u00a76.2, 5th paragraph: This says that if you get an error back for a configure message, you send a new configure message. This seems likely to cause an infinite loop unless some guidance is given about escaping the loop when the endpoints cannot agree on a configuration. \u00a77:\u00a0 I\u2019m confused by the versioning mechanisms. This section requires an endpoint to ignore unknown elements, but it also requires the peer to downgrade to the highest shared version. These requirements seem to be at cross purposes. If the peer downgrades, one should only see unknown elements in the case of implementation errors. The requirement to ignore unknown elements does not come for free; nor does the requirement to downgrade. \u00a75.1 and \u00a78: The use of the options message to negotiate extensions seems underspecified. How does an endpoint compare extensionType elements?\u00a0 Is a spec required or expected? Is the extension spec expected to register the URI for schemaRef somewhere? Does this need to be in IANA?",

In a similar vein, do we want to have any treatment of avoiding infinite loops (e.g., when a 'configure' or 'advertisement' is rejected in expectation of modification but the sending implementation continues to generate an identical message)? It is not clear to me that any change to the document text is needed in either case, but I don't know to what extent the topics have already been discussed.",
