        "text": "I am balloting ABSTAIN on this document because I did not manage to find time to provide my thoughts when the document was being developed and discussed in the community. I do regret that. It seems inappropriate to hold it up at this stage and given how much discussion has taken place. When discussions about developing an anti-harassment policy first began I was in favor of the idea for two reasons. First, I thought we could improve the experience of attending IETF meetings by having a trusted person or people whom attendees could talk to and possibly strategize with if the attendees had experienced harassment. Second, I thought it was important to establish publicly the expectation that all attendees be treated with dignity, decency, and respect. The IESG policy accomplishes the second of these goals and this document seems aimed at accomplishing the first, among other things. I do not believe the document accomplishes the first goal, however. This is because the procedures as outlined turn what could have been the key incremental improvement -- having a trusted person for attendees to talk to -- into a legalistic pile of process and communications that I believe will deter victims of harassment from making use of the system at all. When I have a sensitive incident to report, I want to report it to a single person whom I trust. I do not want to have to agree a priori to having that information shared with a team of three people, nor do I want to be re-directed to some other person who I perhaps trust less. I do not want the person to whom I report it to write it down. I just want to talk it through with the person. Then, if we both agree that some further course of action is warranted, I want to be involved in deciding what course of action I am comfortable with, and I want to continue to be involved in deciding whether to proceed at every step of the way, including steps that involve informing ADs, the secretariat, and other parties. I want to reserve the right to change my mind at any time. The problem with the document as written is that it severely disenfranchises the victim of the harassment, to the point where I expect that most victims would be afraid to actually make use of the procedures outlined in the document. Being harassed can be scary. The policies outlined in the document have utterly failed to account for that. Furthermore, the document in sections 5.1 and 6 contemplates all manner of scenarios that may or may not come to pass and specifies detailed procedures for how to handle them. In practice I expect that there are probably scenarios we haven't thought of that will arise, while the ones for which detailed procedures have been specified might never get used. I wish we could have started with an incremental approach that achieves the two goals stated above, and then checked in after some implementation experience to see where the gaps are and what needs beefing up procedurally. Instead we are going from no process to an over-specified process without any implementation experience to build on. I hope I'm wrong about the potential utility of the process specified in the document, but I cannot support it as written.",

        "text": "I expect the following is just a matter of word smithing or my own comprehension, in which case I can quickly convert to a yes. I am concerned about some text that repeats several times in section 5 for different responsible bodies/persons: \u00a0 \u00a0  \"the Recall Committee is expected to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 understand that their investigation as described in [ RFC7437 ] is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 not to re-evaluate the events of the harassment, and that they are \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 not qualified in handling issues of harassment.\" That can be construed to say that the responsible body cannot disagree with the recommendations of the ombudsteam. How can the body disagree without evaluating things? I don't think that is the intent. If the point is that they are not to re-investigate the facts of the matter, but may make their own decisions about the recommendations of the ombudsteam, I am fine with it--I'm just not sure the text supports that. (For the record, I do not object to the related expectation that responsible bodies take ombudsteam recommendations seriously.) Along those lines, there is a several-times repeated expectation that responsible bodies/persons will follow the recommendations of the ombudsteam. I would prefer not to presume the actions of such bodies. This could be taken as an expectation to rubber-stamp things.",

Btw, a nit: they -> he It seems that the two sentences contradict each other. \"Strongly encouraged to discuss with the Ombudsteam in the event that the AD feels removal from position is not the correct remedy \" but, at the same time, \"is not the intent that the AD re-evaluate the events\" If the Ombudsteam is really in charge, if \"The Ombudsteam is expected to strive for confidentiality\" (so basically the AD shouldn't know all the details),\u00a0 and if the \"AD should not re-evaluate the events\", should we remove this sentence? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"The AD is strongly encouraged to discuss with the Ombudsteam in the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 event that the AD feels removal from position is not the correct \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 remedy.\" Same remark for: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is not the intent \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that the AD or WG chairs re-evaluate the events, and the AD and WG \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 chairs are expected to understand that they are not qualified in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 handling issues of harassment and that they must preserve \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 confidentiality.\u00a0 The AD is strongly encouraged to discuss with \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the Ombudsteam in the event that they or the WG chairs feel \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 removal from position is not the correct remedy. - There is also an issue with the second part of this sentence that contradicts \"is not the intent that the AD re-evaluate the events\" : \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the event that an AD declines to follow the recommendation of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the Ombudsteam as described in the previous bullets, and if the AD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 fails to convince the Ombudsteam of the reasons for this",

I don't believe either is true and believe this sentence should be deleted. There are some possibly relevant laws in some countries that are such that the IETF can't reasonably ask me to agree with those.\u00a0 Put another way: I read this as saying that we're asserting that at any given time the IETF will have consensus on the  relevance of every applicable law everywhere. I do not think  such an IETF consensus exists or can exist. In an IM chat with Pete, we ended up figuring expressing this point like this might help \"We don\u2019t want the ombuds to have  to figure out which of all possible laws in the world are applicable,  and this sentence doesn\u2019t add anything really, since the ombuds  get to decide how to handle any complaint, whether it falls  under any definition or not.

The following change would however fix this: OLD is to prevent all NEW is to deal with and discourage END last-discuss-text, old non-discuss comments are  below here. (I didn't check -10 against these comments - I'm fine to chat more about them if the authors want but I suspect we'd all prefer to get this out the door instead.) Some of my comments on the changed text here are close to discusses, but I think if we resolve the discusses then we'll hopefully also fix what needs fixing below. - intro, 2nd last para: I'd prefer s/intended/only intended/ I do think we should ensure that the ombudsteam can't get out of control, to the extent any formalism would help there. - section 2, 3rd last para: What is the sentence starting with \"One way...\" supposed to mean? Are you trying to get at situations where someone demands favours of some kind (e.g. sexual?) in return for doing what they ought in any case do? I don't think it's useful to be unclear like that. - 3.5: Say if someone refuses to accept that a report has been dealt with for 5 years. Does the lead ombudsbeing continue to be part of the team for all of that time? Do they only handle the existing \"case\"? Is there no way to hand off and finally free our poor ombudsbeing in such a case? (There will be reporters who don't want to let go, and that could be a problem for team members.) Just extending the term isn't a good plan I believe. - 4.1: The respondent is not obliged to co-operate is a tautology and should be omitted. \"May consider failure to co-operate\" sounds a bit too threatening and is it really needed or useful here?  - 4.1: All reports in writing? Why? I think that's a detail for the ombudsteam and they ought be allowed to decide that a word in the ear is the most effective thing to do. I of course agree that all reports of substance need to be dealt with in writing, but even in that case, I don't think you mean that the reporter has to use writing to report. - 5.1: Why does 5.1 say \"Per section 5.1\"?  - 5.1: The two places you say that folks are not qualified are not needed (recall ctte and appointing body) and are I think counterproductive. Any such set of IETFers is actually reasonably likely to have some qualified folks and some not. (And for everyone to believe themselves qualified.) I think you want to say that (over time) we ought (grow to) respect the ombudsteam decisions which is a good goal, (over time) but one that can only be reached (over time) with good demonstrated performance and respect can't just be declared to be required. - 5.1: The AD specific bullet is odd.\u00a0 What if the remedy is to be applied to an IAB programme lead or liaison manager or directorate secretary? I think you could generalise, but at that point it's probably so obvious as to not need saying. Maybe delete that bullet. - 5.1, the last-resort bit: this is good but I think s/should consider/must consider/ is needed there. I can't see there being a case where the ombudsbeing wouldn't consider a lesser remedy and if they ever get to the last resort they really had better have documented (internally) that they did consider lesser remedies. - section 8: this is not only a summary, the last point was not previously made. I didn't check all the others. comments on text previously reviewed: - section 2: the term \"potential harrassment\" is weird, esp in \"reports potential harrassment\" - this would allow a reporter Bob to say that Charlie might be able to harrass Alice. That is always true. - 3.1: The 1st and 2nd sentences here contradict one another. Rewording can fix, e.g. s/shall/ought/ and s/will rapidly/ should rapidly/ - 3.2: \"may consider elements of diversity\" is bogus. Of course the IETF chair can do that. If we want the IETF chair to do so, we should say they ought, not that they may. Strike this or s/may/ought/ - section 4: Will normal web access logs to related web pages be kept? Maybe this'd be better on another domain? - 4.1: The ombudsteam set their own procedures but if the community are unhappy with those the only recourse is the (never used) recall for the IETF chair? That's not going to happen. I think you're missing a middle step where the IETF chair should fire the ombudsteam if the community don't accept team practices and the team don't fix those in response. - 4.1: This dives into too much detail in a number of ways. Let the team figure out those details.\u00a0 E.g., saying \"do like nomcom\" is a bit strong here, I'd allow the team to decide that. They could e.g.\u00a0 prefer to use some kind of whistleblower technology and no email at all. (The statement isn't entirely broken as-is, but is also not needed.) One could maybe say that the team need to be at least as careful as nomcom should be. - 4.1: The shall in \"shall not be subject to retaliation\" is wishful thinking. Nobody can control that. I think you want to say that good-faith reports ought not by themselves be considered a negative and that this is something on which the IETF has consensus.",
