        "text": "I have two things I'd like to chat about, given that these applicability documents are where the roll WG has iirc said it'd address security and privacy issues with RPL: (1) 7.1.7: Don't you need to turn that \"may not need\" around and say that AMI deployments of RPL REQUIRE implementation (and maybe use) of link layer and higher layer security features? (You almost say that in 9.3 I think, so it'd maybe be good to be crystal clear. (2) Why are there no privacy considerations? I think this document needs that. For example, an AMI mesh based purely on link layer security could be a total privacy nightmare. And part of that is down to RPL - if I can cause lots of folks' traffic to be sent to me, that is RPL's issue. That I can then see the application layer content is not RPL's fault, but is still relevant.\u00a0 I think this section is important to include because the authors here are presumably the ones who know the application layer information. And the sensitive information might not only be readings, it could include packet size, if larger packets are caused by activity such as turning on heating, then larger packets indicate presence and smaller ones absence, depending on weather. I am also concerned that there may be privacy issues arising from the various identifiers in use here.\u00a0 Did the WG consider these issues and their potential impact on how it is or is not safe to use RPL? (While the analysis might sound complex, I'd bet that not much new text would be needed, but who knows until the analysis has been done.)",
