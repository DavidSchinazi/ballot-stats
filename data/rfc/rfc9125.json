        "text": "Thanks for having the discussion with John and updating the document already; I benefitted a lot from being able to read the -11 that has started rolling in fixes from the prior discussion.\u00a0 My one new discuss point is relatively minor, all things considered, and is really just trying to nail down an aspect of internal consistency.\u00a0 (I also support Roman's disuss, but we don't need to rehash that here.) When we introduce the concept of gateways, we say that they can be attached to the Internet or a backbone network.\u00a0 We then go on to provide a mechanism for gateways to advertise to some tunnel ingress node the complete set of gateways for a given site.\u00a0 It seems that we do fairly consistently refer to this advertisement as being over \"the backbone network\", but I'm not seeing anything that clearly disclaims the applicability of this technique over the Internet itself.\u00a0 However, I think we need to have such a disclaimer, since we do have a clearly stated assumption that \"the connected set of DCs *and the backbone network connecting them* are part of the same SR BGP Link State (LS) instance ([ RFC7752 ] and [ I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe ])\" (emphasis mine).\u00a0 If the intent is to only use this mechanism over \"in-BGP-LS-instance\" backbones and not over the Internet, we should explicitly set the scope of applicability and contrast a gateway as a generic concept and the gateway scenarios that this mechanism applies to.",

The document says: \"The solution defined in this document can be seen in the broader context of SR domain interconnection in [ I-D.farrel-spring-sr-domain-interconnect ]. \", which says: \" Traffic originating in one SR domain often terminates in another SR domain, but must transit a backbone network that provides interconnection between those domains.\" -- is it unclear to me if this is really what is being proposed... I'm hoping that I'm really misunderstanding something here -- please educate me.",
