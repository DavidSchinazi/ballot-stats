RFC 2119  keyword usage makes the reference a Normative reference, yet it is currently listed as informative. 3.4.\u00a0 SRMS Preference TLV \u00a0  The Segment Routing Mapping Server Preference TLV (SRMS Preference \u00a0  TLV) is used to advertise a preference associated with the node that \u00a0  acts as an SR Mapping Server.\u00a0 The role of an SRMS is described in \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop ]. As draff-ietf-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop needs to be read in order to understand what SR Mapping Server is, this reference must also be Normative. \u00a0 SRMS preference is defined in [ I-D.ietf-spring-conflict-resolution ]. This just confirms that this reference must be Normative. 2) In Section 3.1: \u00a0  When multiple SR-Algorithm TLVs are received from a given router, the \u00a0  receiver SHOULD use the first occurrence of the TLV in the Router \u00a0  Information LSA.\u00a0 If the SR-Algorithm TLV appears in multiple Router \u00a0  Information LSAs that have different flooding scopes, the SR- \u00a0  Algorithm TLV in the Router Information LSA with the area-scoped \u00a0  flooding scope SHOULD be used.\u00a0 If the SR-Algorithm TLV appears in \u00a0  multiple Router Information LSAs that have the same flooding scope, \u00a0  the SR-Algorithm TLV in the Router Information (RI) LSA with the \u00a0  numerically smallest Instance ID SHOULD be used and subsequent \u00a0  instances of the SR-Algorithm TLV SHOULD be ignored. In the last 2 sentences: why are you using SHOULD (twice) instead of MUST? This seems to affect interoperability. (I think there is similar text in another section.)",
