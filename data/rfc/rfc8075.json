In Section 10.1, this is more of a security than a privacy consideration as this is \"network reconnaissance\".\u00a0 This is a typical pre-cursor to an attack one the the attacker has gathered more information on the network. \u00a0  From a privacy perspective, they can be \u00a0  used to gather detailed information about the resources hosted in the \u00a0  constrained network.  How about: \u00a0  This can be \u00a0  used to gather detailed information about the resources hosted in the \u00a0  constrained network, as siting with network reconnaissance. then for the last sentence: \u00a0  If privacy is a concern, for \u00a0  example whenever the HTTP request transits through the public \u00a0  Internet, the request SHOULD be transported over a mutually \u00a0  authenticated and encrypted TLS connection. How about: \u00a0  If confidentiality of the network is a concern, for \u00a0  example whenever the HTTP request transits through the public \u00a0  Internet, the request SHOULD be transported over a mutually \u00a0  authenticated and encrypted TLS connection.  The word privacy here is confusing, so it's better to state exactly the issue. More importantly, if you can do network reconnaissance, what's to stop the attacker from using this new method of connecting?\u00a0 Some mention of this threat should be explicitly stated, maybe section 10.1 is the best place to do that, expanding on the existing text with another sentence.\u00a0  2. (Really part of #1, but a separate point) Could transforms of URIs result in successful attacks?\u00a0 I would think that would be the highest security consideration.\u00a0 Although  RFC7230  includes similar considerations, the mapping aspect of this draft could open up new attack possibilities, especially if a media type mapping is used.\u00a0 If there is an attack possible in the IoT space that is not in the HTTP world (device specific, or related to size constraints and coding), an intrusion prevention system monitoring the HTTP traffic before it is transformed would not pick it up and the attack traffic would evade detection.\u00a0 I think this merits mention and some text in the draft.\u00a0 Please let me know if it is elsewhere and another pointer is all that is needed.
