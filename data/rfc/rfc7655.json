The VBR security problems cited in  RFC 6562  seem to apply to this  draft and the mitigation techniques described in the draft don't seem to  properly address those problems. For example, adding statistically variable  padding to very small G.711.0 frames would not prevent recognition of a  prerecorded message if the set of all possible messages is known. If the  authors of this draft have not consulted an expert on the security issues  raised by VBR, they should do so. In addition to this concern, there may be a buffer overrun  vulnerability in the payload decoding algorithm described in section 4.2.3.  The authors carefully ensure that the input buffer is not overrun but no  similar protections for the output buffer are described. At least, the SecDir reviewer (& I) didn't  see them. A buffer overrun of the output buffer would be a major flaw. If such  a flaw is present (and I believe that it is), the document should not be  allowed to proceed until this flaw is fixed.
