        "text": "I have two things I'd like to discuss: (1) Section 10 says: \" This document does not alter [ RFC5812 ] or the ForCES Protocol[ RFC5810 ].\u00a0 As such, it has no impact on these documents security considerations.\u00a0 This document simply defines the operational parameters and capabilities of an LFB that performs LFB class instance extensions across nodes under a single administrative control.\u00a0 This document does not attempt to analyze the presence or possibility of security interactions created by allowing LFB graph extension on packets.\u00a0 Any such issues, if they exist should be resolved by the designers of the particular data path i.e they are not the responsibility of general mechanism outlined in this document; one such option for protecting Ethernet is the use of IEEE 802.1AE Media Access Control Security [ieee8021ae] which provides encryption and authentication. \" I'm not sure I buy that explanation. While you may not be changing the protocol much, you are sending PDUs over a network where they previously were processed within one machine. IIRC, earlier ForCES documents called for IPSec or TLS as mandatory-to-implement (MTI) for anything where ForCES stuff was being sent \"off the box.\" That is clearly being done here, so I don't get how MACsec is now regarded as optional to implement. Can you explain? That may be me recalling incorrectly, or perhaps there is a good reason, but if the above logic were correct there would have been no reason to have said earlier that security was MTI so I'm confused. (2) I'm also unsure that just saying \"use MACsec\" is enough to get interop and security for this. For example, is it likely that separate keys would be setup just for ForCES use here?\u00a0 If so, saying that's needed would be good. If not, I wonder what threats might arise with spoofing ForCES traffic from a box that has the right MACsec keys. Has someone implemented/tested with MACsec and considered those issues?",
