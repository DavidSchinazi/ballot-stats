Once the trivial DISCUSS is addressed, I will be happy to ballot a YES. Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Bernie Volz for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus even if the justification of the intended status is rather vague.  Other thanks to Tatuya Jinmei, the Internet directorate reviewer (at my request), please consider this int-dir review: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-opsawg-add-encrypted-dns-10-intdir-telechat-jinmei-2023-03-09/  (and I have read Med's replies and resolution of the issues) I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### What to do with non-permitted DHCP option ? Sections 3.1 and 3.2 contain text like `Permitted DHCPv6 options in the DHCPv6-Options Attribute are maintained by IANA in the registry created in Section 8.4.1.` but I was unable to find anywhere in the document what is the expected behaviour of a RADIUS client receiving a non-permitted DHCP option ? At the bare minimum, I would expect the I-D to mention \"non-permitted DHCP options MUST silently be ignored by the RADIUS client\" Or did I fail to find a similar statement in the text ?",
