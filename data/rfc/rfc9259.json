There's also quite a few other internal incosistencies in this document, such as copy/paste chunks that refer to \"N4\" as executing a given SID in a scenario where it is actually a different node doing so, many instances where a given IP address or SID does not match up with the addressing structure listed in Section 1.3, places where we seem to say that an SR ingress node can be a classic IPv6 node that lacks SRv6 capabilities, etc.\u00a0 Individually, many of these would be nit-level (and indeed are called out specifically in the NITS section of my ballot comment), but collectively they seem to indicate a document that is not yet in publishable state.",

It is comforting (even if not surprising) that the simple \"good old\" ping/traceroute work on a SRv6 network ;-) Thanks to Carlos Bernardos for his INT-REVIEW at  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam-10-intdir-telechat-bernardos-2021-05-28/ Thanks to Ole Tr\u00f8an for his shepherd document even if I regret the lack of justification for 'standards track'. Especially, because the abstract is mainly about ping/traceroute, hence should be informational but the O-flag is indeed standard track. So, all in all, this is OK. Please find below two blocking but trivial DISCUSS points, some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated), and one nit. I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric == DISCUSS == -- Section 2.1 -- As \"a penultimate segment SHOULD NOT be a Penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) SID\" is normative, then the network programming  RFC 8986  should be a normative reference.

        "text": "I can't get past the feeling this document is really two different documents mashed together. One is a Standards Track, 6man document, that defines the O-flag. All the meat of that document is in \u00a72.1 and \u00a72.2, it would make a nice, compact, readable 3 or 4 page RFC (maybe a little more once all the boilerplate was in). The other is an Informational, SPRING document, that talks about use cases at some length. It seems both cruel and counterproductive to force SRv6 implementors who are implementing the O-flag to read through the entire balance of the document just to be sure they haven't missed something important. Remember these documents will live a long time, and it seems irresponsible to clutter the essential document set with inessential use cases. My suggestion is to split the document as outlined above.",
