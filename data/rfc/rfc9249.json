Let's also take another look at the use of nacm:default-deny-all for sensitive authentication-related nodes.\u00a0 My understanding is that typically we only block of the actual secret key material in this way and let the associated metadata (key names, algorithms, etc.) be retrieved.\u00a0 The current module may have default-deny-all in more places than is needed, and we show an example of retrieving key information that ought to have been denied by this ACL. It seems that the current module does not use  RFC 8177  key-chain functionality (despite listing  RFC 8177  as a reference).\u00a0 It seems that best practices for cryptographic configuration would be to use the key-chain functionality, though I may be misunderstanding things.",
