IIRC when JOSE was done there was a feeling that adding a MUST or SHOULD for that was tricky due to lack of support in libraries. When we recently re-checked for COSE, the answer was that today, it's ok to have that as a MUST or SHOULD. (If some kind of FIPS-140 stuff precludes a MUST, then a \"SHOULD unless you're sad enough to be stuck having to pay lip lipservice to FIPS-140\" clause might be right. So the DISCUSS point here is: given the real-world demonstrated weakness inherent in the need for an RNG in ECDSA why didn't the WG choose to at least RECOMMEND deterministic ECDSA? (Or better, make it a MUST.) If the answer is: \"we thought about it [ref] and decided to not require deterministic\" then I'll clear. But even if the WG did consider it a couple of years ago, the situation may have changed so a quick re-think might be worthwhile.",
