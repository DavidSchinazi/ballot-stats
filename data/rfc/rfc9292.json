        "text": "# \u00c9ric Vyncke, INT AD, comments for  draft-ietf-httpbis-binary-message-05 cc @evyncke Thank you for the work put into this document. And I really mean it even when balloting a blocking DISCUSS because it will be useful. BTW, I sincerely hate to be process-focused and I hope to stand corrected quickly. Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points, which may be resolved during the IESG formal telechat. Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Does it fit HTTPBIS charter ? While I think that this document is useful (even if I have doubts about standards track rather than informational as for the expired PCAP I-D in OPSAWG), I fail to see how this document fits the HTTPBIS charter. The only potential way is at the end of the charter: ``` # Other HTTP-Related Work The Working Group may define extensions and other documents related to HTTP as work items, provided that: * They are generic; i.e., not specific to one application using HTTP. Note that Web browsing by definition is a generic use. * The Working Group Chairs judge that there is consensus to take on the item and believe that it will not interfere with the work described above, and * The Area Director approves the addition and add corresponding milestones. ``` But I do not see any related milestone to this document. Moving this document to AD sponsored is probably the right way. ## Notes This review is in the [\"IETF Comments\" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the [`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into individual GitHub issues.
