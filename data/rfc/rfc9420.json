In the end I decided to ballot abstain because I'm unsure whether standardizing MLS in really the right thing to do for end users (which may just be my ignorance).\u00a0 I'm strongly supportive of efforts to make messaging platforms interoperate cleanly (e.g., I'm supportive of the MIMI WG being chartered) and I appreciate that MLS is likely to underpin some of that work, but I also question whether the IETF standardizing this will ultimately be beneficial for societies and humanity (and note - I'm not advocating for pervasive monitoring, but preventing any ability for judicially supported interceptions for criminal investigations concerns me).\u00a0 In the limited cases where IETF standardization and technology choices are could directly impact the effectiveness of law enforcement or conflict with democratically elected government policies then I think that it would be great if the IETF was able to receive and consider a wider range of views in the consensus process to ensure that we really are making the right choices.
