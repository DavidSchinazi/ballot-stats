        "text": "This document reads more like a white paper or research paper than an RFC. I also find naming this protocol (Chronos or Khronos?) a bit strange, as it is not really a new protocol but more a configuration suggestion of existing NTPv4 parameters. If I try to reduce the text to that was it really required for implementers, it would be something like: - Instead of 2 or 3 system configured NTP servers (eg obtained via DHCP options or hardcoded configuration), use a dozen from a well known pool (eg  pool.ntp.org ) of a few hundred. - Throw away the top 1/3 and bottom 1/3. Average the remainder. If too far from current time, get fresh samples. (note this isn't a recursive process, so I'm not sure what to do when the fresh samples have the same issues as the original samples) - Repeat after X time. It would be good to have a straightforward short section with an concise specification. The pseudo code section is sort of that, but doesn't say anything about timings and when to get how many samples. This section should appear before the Security Considerations section, or else the security section is read without the reader having a proper context. The document declares out of scope attackers that can delay (practically) all NTP answers, but that is exactly what you would encounter at like a coffee shop or hotel wifi, or being on mobile data with a malicious/compromised telco. If this protocol is more suited towards datacentre (DC) deployments and not mobile endusers, than another issue comes up. In DCs specifically, one tends to rely on the local NTP servers and for security reasons often won't allow connections to NTP servers outside of the DC. Those local NTP servers could even have their own atomic clock or other hardware to make them specifically much more reliable than random NTP servers on the net that have all sync'ed to/from each other in a large pool. How does this document solve a problem that NTS does not solve? I assume one use case is if the few target NTS servers configured would be compromised? But is that an issue that current NTP clients are being attacked with?\u00a0 What would the harm be for most clients to have their time off by say 30 seconds ? That is, who should implement and run this ? Perhaps an Operational Considerations Section could explain this? Who should run this where and when? Where should one not run this?",
