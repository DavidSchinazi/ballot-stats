        "text": "(I agree with Ekr's DISCUSS about these being bearer tokens and am happy to see the discussion on improving the text there.) There are a couple of other things that I seek discussion on: The document itself does very little to motivate the addition of the allocation token, from a security point of view.\u00a0 In what security model is there a security advantage from having this sort of single-use authorization token as opposed to using existing authentication and authorization methods?\u00a0 The use case of a premium domain-name auction that came up in Ekr's ballot thread is actually quite enlightening, in that the token allows for the authorization to be granted to the winner of an auction even in the case where the winning bidder and the current registration owner do not have any common authentication or authorization infrastructure (other than for the auction and its payment itself).\u00a0 Some generalization of these considerations into a model that matches the generalized functionality in the draft would be a quite helpful addition. This could also be leveraged in the discussion of why the allocation token is not needed in the various commands for which its usage is not provided (mentioned in my COMMENT). I also request changes to the examples (or the discussion surrounding them). Using \"abc123\" as the example allocation token is probably unwise, as that value provides none of the properties we desire from allocation tokens. If you don't want to use an actual random-looking (e.g., self-encrypted server-generated) or signed value because it makes the examples too long, at least provide some text indicating that \"abc123\" is a placeholder and real tokens should have a different structure. Similarly, the passwords used in the examples hardly have enough entropy to be considered secure by modern standards.",
