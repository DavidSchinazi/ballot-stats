The security considerations says: \"The bfdSessAuthenticationType, bfdSessAuthenticationKeyID, and bfdSessAuthenticationKey objects hold security methods and associated security keys of BFD sessions.\u00a0 These objects SHOULD be considered highly sensitive objects.\u00a0 In order to prevent this sensitive information from being improperly accessed, implementers MAY disallow access to these objects.\" I don't understand why these SHOULD (and not MUST) be considered highly sensitive - maybe that's just me not knowing enough about MIBs though - what's the logic there? Allowing access to a cleartext key that can then by used to muck with routing seems like a bad plan in all cases. Also, if you said they MUST be considered highly sensitive can you say what that'd mean in practice that's different from the current SHOULD? (Maybe the MAY in the 2nd sentence would change?) Finally, if you keep the SHOULD, then what is the counterexample that justifies the SHOULD rather than a MUST?",
