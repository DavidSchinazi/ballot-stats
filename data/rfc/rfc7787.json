        "text": "First,\u00a0 I have a number of specific comments.\u00a0  Some of these are hazards to technical interoperability; I've tried to include those in my discuss - but the general point is that it is very hard to tell a number of details because the structure is assumed.\u00a0  Having read this document, I do not think that I could properly implement DNCP from scratch. Obviously, I can guess at the answers - but that doesn't let everyone interoperate well.\u00a0  Examples include: a) What is a topology graph?\u00a0 When is it created, modified, or destroyed?\u00a0 Is it a conceptual artifact constructed from the various TLVs?\u00a0 I think a quick paragraph describing it would help. b) How are peer relationships discovered and established and destroyed?\u00a0 I really can't tell from the draft and even a quick scan of  RFC 6206  doesn't give any hints. c) It looks like the TLVs are sent one after another in a datagram or stream across a socket.\u00a0 The closest I see to any detail is \"TLVs are sent across the transport as is\".\u00a0  d) As far as I can tell, Trickle is used to decide basically how often to send information - but the details of this and the interactions aren't clear to me. I suspect that there are dependencies on the HNCP draft that would make this a lot easier to understand but since we want it to progress separately, the document does need to stand alone. Although not noted in the Shepherd's report, I did have a thorough Routing Directorate review done and the draft was improved from that. 8) In Sec 4.6 \"\u00a0  o\u00a0 The origination time (in milliseconds) of R's node data is greater \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 than current time in - 2^32 + 2^15.\"\u00a0 Since origination time hasn't yet been introduced, I'm going on an assumption that it means when R's node data was originated from R.\u00a0 So - this requirement is saying that R's node data must have been generated in the future (but already known by the local node)??? 9) In Sec 4.6 \"They MAY be removed immediately after the topology graph traversal\"\u00a0 The DNCP nodes can be removed from what??\u00a0 The topology graph?\u00a0 From some type of received TLV??\u00a0 How would they be added back in later? 11) In sec 6.1: \"Trickle-driven status updates (Section 4.3) provide a mechanism for \u00a0  handling of new peer detection on an endpoint, as well as state \u00a0  change notifications.\"\u00a0  Nothing in Sec 4.3 talked about a mechanism for detecting new peers on an endpoint.\u00a0 It is entirely possible that Trickle does provide this (but what about the modes where Trickle isn't used/needed??) but there needs to be a description of how new peer detection is done - even if it's just a pointer to Trickle RFCs. 12) In Sec 6.1.4: \"\u00a0  On receipt of a Network State TLV (Section 7.2.2) which is consistent \u00a0  with the locally calculated network state hash, the Last contact \u00a0  timestamp for the peer MUST be updated.\"\u00a0  Could you add some rationale for why this is needed?\u00a0 I suspect that part of my confusion is that the \"locally calculated network state hash\" could mean two different things.\u00a0 Is it the hash computed by the local node on the data received in the Network State TLV to validate that the Network State TLV is not corrupted?\u00a0 Or is it the hash computed by the local node on its arbitrarily wide 1-hash tree that represents the local node's network state?\u00a0  Since the term is never defined, it's hard to guess here.\u00a0 The bottom of Sec 7.2.2 uses \"current locally calculated network state hash\" to refer to, I believe, the latter. 13) In Sec 6.2: \"normally form peer relationships with all peers.\"\u00a0 Where is forming a peer relationship defined?\u00a0 Is this tied solely to Trickle instances?\u00a0 What about with reliable unicast  where presumably Trickle isn't used between peers as the Overview states \"If used in pure unicast mode with unreliable transport, Trickle is also used between peers\"? 14) In Sec 7: \"\u00a0  For example, type=123 (0x7b) TLV with value 'x' (120 = 0x78) is \u00a0  encoded as: 007B 0001 7800 0000.\u00a0 If it were to have sub-TLV of \u00a0  type=124 (0x7c) with value 'y', it would be encoded as 007B 0009 7800 \u00a0  0000 007C 0001 7900 0000.\"\u00a0  In this case, the padding between the TLV's value and the sub-TLV is included but the padding after the sub-TLV is not.\u00a0 What would happen if there were multiple sub-TLVs??\u00a0 Would the padding between those sub-TLVs be included? Also related :\"In this case the length field includes the length of the original TLV, the  length of the padding that are inserted before the embedded TLVs and the length of the  added TLVs.\"\u00a0 Here, the phrase \"length of the TLV\" means different things.\u00a0 In the first case, \"length of the original TLV\" means the \"length of the value in the encapsulating TLV\".\u00a0 In the second case, \"length of the added TLVs\" appears to mean the length of the sub-TLVs  including the type/length header.\u00a0 As I mentioned above, I can't tell what happens to the  padding in between sub-TLVs.",

I believe the concept of an \"abstract protocol specification\" does not align with the IETF's goal of generating clear and inter-operable protocol specifications. This approach requires an implementer to resolve differences between the abstract protocol specification and the profile rather than simply implementing a single protocol specification. Such an approach has a higher probability of error than the single specification approach. If the basic premise of a protocol is sound and applicable for other uses, a new protocol specification can be written that borrows the necessary part from the previous protocol and makes any requisite changes for the new use.

I'm looking at this text: \u00a0  If keep-alives specified in Section 6.1 are NOT sent by the peer \u00a0  (either the DNCP profile does not specify the use of keep-alives or \u00a0  the particular peer chooses not to send keep-alives), some other \u00a0  existing local transport-specific means (such as Ethernet carrier- \u00a0  detection or TCP keep-alive) MUST be used to ensure its presence. \u00a0   and wondering if using TCP keep-alive for liveness detection is realistic in the use cases this specification is expecting to address.  Unless I missed something, the default TCP keep-alive interval is still two hours (that's been true since  RFC 1122 , and also true in the relatively recent version of Linux I'm using). If that's OK, I'll clear. If you're assuming a keep-alive interval that's shorter, lots of implementations allow you to tune this, but it seems like the specification should say something about that. Given that the other example of \"transport-specific means\" is Ethernet carrier-detection, which would be orders of magnitude faster, I thought I should ask.",
