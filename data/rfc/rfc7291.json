Sections 6 & 7 don't seem to fit with the goal of this document (defining the DHCP option formats).\u00a0 Those sections simply point to pcp-server-selection, which would need to be read anyways when building a PCP client.\u00a0 Can you point me to the discussion where those sections were deemed necessary for this document?\u00a0 And if these sections remain, it would appear that pcp-server-selection would need to be a normative reference.",

On a particular point to explain: \u00a0  However, DHCP servers MUST NOT treat IP addresses \u00a0  returned from a single Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) lookup as \u00a0  belonging to more than one PCP server. \u00a0   That seems like completely bogus to me. It is *perfectly* reasonable for me to make a DNS record containing all of the A or AAAA records for all of my PCP servers, and then write my DHCP server to divide them up on the basis of subnet mask, where it will consider all addresses part of the same subnet as a single server, and each set of addresses from different subnets as different servers. You are making a protocol requirement that I set up my DNS configuration and DHCP configuration in a particular way, and that's not appropriate. If this were a non-normative section, describing possible configuration choices, e.g., \"A site could make different FQDNs for each PCP server, have the DHCP server configured with FQDNs, and treat the A or AAAA results from each FQDN as a separate server\", I'd have no complaint. But this entire section presumes a bunch of undocumented out-of-band information (like, \"The configuration for PCP servers in a DHCP server is done by FQDNs\"), and then sticks requirements language next to the result of those presumptions.",
