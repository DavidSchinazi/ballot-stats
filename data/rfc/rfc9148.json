DISCUSS: 5.4.\u00a0 Message Bindings \u00a0  o\u00a0 The CoAP Options used are Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port, Content- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Format, Block1, Block2, and Accept.\u00a0 These CoAP Options are used \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to communicate the HTTP fields specified in the EST REST messages. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Uri-host and Uri-Port Options can be omitted from the COAP \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 message sent on the wire. The statement above \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When omitted, they are logically \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 assumed to be the transport protocol destination address and port \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 respectively.\u00a0 Explicit Uri-Host and Uri-Port Options are \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 typically used when an endpoint hosts multiple virtual servers and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 uses the Options to route the requests accordingly. and the last quoted statement: How can the sender know whether or not it is Ok to omit Uri-Host/Uri-Port? 7.\u00a0 Parameters \u00a0  It is recommended, based on experiments, \u00a0  to follow the default CoAP configuration parameters ([ RFC7252 ]). \u00a0  However, depending on the implementation scenario, retransmissions \u00a0  and timeouts can also occur on other networking layers, governed by \u00a0  other configuration parameters.\u00a0 When a change in a server parameter \u00a0  has taken place, the parameter values in the communicating endpoints \u00a0  MUST be adjusted as necessary. The last sentence: use of MUST with passive voice is really unhelpful here. Adjusted by whom? How can this MUST be satisfied?",
