        "text": "I'd started balloting this as Abstain, but while writing up the ballot I realized that it's important enough that it deserves to be DISCUSSed. This is clearly clever, but feels to me like it might fall into \"Oo, you are so sharp you\u2019ll cut yourself one of these days\"[0] territory. I'm not saying that the \"v4-via-v6\" is a *bad* idea, but I really don't think that it should be introduced / documented in a Standards Track Babel document - it touches core plumbing, and should be discussed and documented in a V6OPS (or 6MAN) document, and then this document includes it by reference. If this was only ever going to used in Babel environments I'd be much less concerned, but I suspect (hope?) that future solutions will want to do very similar things, and that it needs to be reviewed with an assumption that it might get widely used. It should documented in a \"self contained\" manner so it can be cleanly referenced - at the moment, a reference would need to point at bits of Section 1 and 3, and there is some feeling of \"this is probably safe, the 192.0.0.8 bit might make operations / debugging a bit harder, but... \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" If this has already received significant discussion in V6OPS / similar, or if it is already clearly documented elsewhere[1], I'll clear my DISCUSS and Abstain or support it. I'm sure that this DISCUSS will be frustrating to the authors/WG - I'm doing so because I'd like to see this technique more able to be used (and make sure that there aren't any sharp pointy bits), not because I think it's a bad idea...  [0]: quote from Terry Pratchett, Thief of Time [1]: I suspect it is already documented somewhere, but the closest I can think is  RFC7600  - \"IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 - A Stateless Solution (4rd)\", an Experimental document which is noticeably different to this. If it *is* already documented somewhere else though, then why is this not just referencing that instead?",
