There are two shortcomings in the text that I would like to discuss with the sponsoring AD.  Firstly when I can across the topic of bootstrapping I was quite excited that there was going to be a serious discussion of how you bring up and manage an SDN, whether an IGP was required to create a base topology, and if not how this all worked. Unfortunately this did not seem to be addressed by the authors. Secondly, there was no discussion of OAM or other test and verification tools that I could see, which is also a topic that deserves consideration in such a document. The document fulfills the roll of a primer on SDN within the IETF, and would be significantly improved with text on those topics.",

Unfortunately this did not seem to be addressed by the authors.\" This is partially addressed by the new fifth para in the bootstrapping text, but I think that you need to go a little further. You handle that case where SDN provides overlay on a conventional IGP based network. However, I think that some claim that SDN can be a substitute for an IGP based network approach, and I think that you need to address the point that there MUST at all times be a resilient method for all nodes to discover and connect to the SDN controller. Where the SDN is not an overlay function over a network using an existing IGP, either a specialist additional network is required to provide that discovery and connection functionality, or a suitable alternative boostrap protocol needs to be developed and deployed.",
