It seems to me that this document needs to change all the registration entries that cite 5201, making them point to this document instead. 2. This document doesn't create the registries that it says it creates, and it shouldn't say that it does.\u00a0 But this document changes the registration policies of some of the registries, so it needs to make those changes clear.\u00a0 Perhaps (1) and (2) are already in the plan, in response to IANA's questions. 3. The last paragraph describing the Parameter Type registry says that \"all other values\" (it would be better to list them: 1024 through 32767 and 49152 through 61439) are assigned through \"Fist Come First Served, with Specification Required.\"\u00a0 I realize the policy specification is unchanged from 5201, but it's not a valid policy combination.\u00a0 What is it intended to mean?\u00a0 FCFS and Specification Required are contradictory policies.\u00a0 Perhaps what you want is FCFS, with a documentation reference recorded in the registry.\u00a0 You can then say a few words about what registrants should make sure the reference document contains, but realize that it will not be validated by anyone for completeness or sensibility. 4. 5201 specified that the experimentation range ended at 49141; this changes it to 49151.\u00a0 I just want to make sure that was intentional, and not a typo.\u00a0 Will you confirm that? 5. In the table at the end of Section 5.2, the reserved range that follows the experimental one seems to have a typo in it: it says \"41952\", and should say \"49152\".\u00a0 There's also a discrepancy between the \"61440 - 64443\" range and the following \"62464 - 63487\" range.\u00a0 I have no idea which one has the typo there. 6. The comment in (3) about FCFS also applies to the Notify Message Type registry.\u00a0 Also, in the ranges given, the value 16384 doesn't fall in any range.",

(4) (5.2.8) Did the WG discuss deprecating the NULL encryption option? (Haven't you finished testing yet:-) Also - there are no counter modes, is that wise? Finally, HIPv1's encryption codepoint 1 was for a 3DES option, but here you have 1 == NULL, yet you deprecate codepoint 3, which is confusing. Why is that? (5) Requiring HMAC-SHA-1 in 6.4.1 seems a bit odd. If HMAC-SHA-256 is supported, then why not just use that? Is there are real benefit in the sha1 variant?",

Similarly, making the 1536 bit group the MTI (in 5.2.7) is odd as is the assertion that \"web surfing\" can use a lower security level. (In other words ignore text below here.)",
