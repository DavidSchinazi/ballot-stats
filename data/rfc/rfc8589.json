        "text": "Thanks to the authors for a well-written and clear document. I have a little bit of confusion about the address resolution scheme mentioned in this document. In section 1.1, The document says: >\u00a0 Frogans is a medium for publishing content and services on the >\u00a0 Internet.\u00a0 From its inception in 1999, the medium was designed as a >\u00a0 generic software layer running on top of the original Internet >\u00a0 infrastructure, i.e. the TCP and IP protocols and the Domain Name >\u00a0 System (DNS) I'm taking particular note of the mention of DNS here. Further down in this section, it then says: >\u00a0 o\u00a0 A registry, called the Frogans Core Registry (FCR), that contains >\u00a0 \u00a0  all Frogans addresses registered by Frogans site publishers.\u00a0 The >\u00a0 \u00a0  registry operator, called the FCR Operator, ensures the resolution >\u00a0 \u00a0  of Frogans addresses when end users enter them in Frogans Player. This implies that conversion from a Frogans address to an IP address is handled by the FCR rather than by DNS, although this isn't spelled out. On the other hand, this is the only part of the system that obviously uses a name-to-address resolution mechanism, so I'm left wondering whether there is any DNS aspect to this resolution. The reason I ask is that the current encoding scheme, which encodes the site-name as (what would in DNS be called) URL-escaped U-labels, is rather out of sync with other URL schemes, which use Punycode for host identifiers. If these URIs aren't used by DNS, that's fine -- but if they are, then I have some follow-up actions to suggest. Thanks!",

The rights to reproduce the trademark in the document are already fully described in  RFC 5378  Section 5.3; making a grant of rights here in the text of this document that is both narrower and broader than the language in  RFC 5378  seems problematic. Also, I'm not sure that the IETF IPR policies extend to cover \"rights to use the scheme name in ... Internet protocols\" (if that is read to mean protocols on the wire). I think the appropriate thing to do would be to delete Section 5 and, if the holders of the trademark are willing, to file a disclosure in accordance with  BCP 79 . I've cc'ed the IETF legal counsel on this mail so he can chime in on the discussion if necessary.",
