If another address should be signaled to the other host, this needs to be indicated by the application or at least some kind of policy framework above MPTCP. Also MPTCP will by default use both paths simultaneously while still looking like one connection to the application, meaning the application has no control which path is used for which traffic. I guess you can open a second subflow and then configure the first subflow as backup path but I'm not sure if that's what you want (given the application/policy framework will still not know which path is used)..?
