I have seen Alia's reply: \u00a0 \u00a0 In the BIER Charter, work item 9 describes a document based on deployment \u00a0 \u00a0 experience that can justify moving the BIER work from Experimental to Standards \u00a0 \u00a0 Track.\u00a0 When I chartered the WG, it wasn't clear whether it was merely a good idea \u00a0 \u00a0 or a good idea with enough motivations towards deployment that it is worth complicating \u00a0 \u00a0 the architecture at the narrow point of the IP hourglass. From the writeup, it seems that the experiment is successful already: \u00a0 \u00a0 The vendors are being quite tight lipped about current implementations. \u00a0 \u00a0 Operator feedback indicates there are at least two implementations currently, with others in the works. \u00a0 \u00a0 There are currently five vendors collaborating on the work in the IETF.  However, I've not been following the specifications development and implementation to provide a definitive answer. At the minimum, the document needs to describe what the criteria are for a successful experiment. \u00a0 \u00a0 Implementations ( RFC7942 ?)? \u00a0 \u00a0 two interop implementations? \u00a0 \u00a0 hardware implementation? \u00a0 \u00a0 \"deployment experience\" (to cite the charter text)? \u00a0 \u00a0 impact analysis? \u00a0 \u00a0 something else? The ideal BIER document for this explanation is this architecture doc. A reference to the charter Item 9 would be a good start. Examples: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7360#section-1.3 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7499#section-2 2. operations and management section I'm sure there are such considerations: \u00a0 \u00a0 - configuration \u00a0 \u00a0 - sub-domain management \u00a0 \u00a0 - BFR-id management \u00a0 \u00a0 - adding new BFIR/BFER device to the domain \u00a0 \u00a0 - logging \u00a0 \u00a0 - troubleshooting \u00a0 \u00a0 - OAM \u00a0 \u00a0 - etc. There are also two other management documents that should be referenced: chartered item 6 and 7. There are some management sentences, from time to time, in the doc. Ex: avoiding a second copy is an important from an operational point of view \u00a0  It is generally advantageous to assign the BFR-ids of a given sub- \u00a0  domain so that as many BFERs as possible can be represented in a \u00a0  single bit string. \u00a0  ... \u00a0  In order to minimize the number of copies that must be made of a \u00a0  given multicast packet, it is RECOMMENDED that the BFR-ids be \u00a0  assigned \"densely\" (see Section 2) from the numbering space... \u00a0 \u00a0 Btw, I guess you meant: assigned densely per subdomain, right? What this \"operations and management section\" should contain is the points that operators, who will deploy this technology, have to pay attention to. An architecture document is typically the first document people will read.  RFC 5706  appendix A provide typical questions from an OPS point of view. I understand that this is an experiment and you might not have all the answers at this point in time.",

The shepherd writeup says: \"(1) Experimental, as per charter. The document title page header indicates experimental. \", but this doesn't really answer the question; the charter says:  \"BIER is initially chartered to do experimental work on this new multicast forwarding mechanism as follows: 1) BIER architecture: The WG will publish an architecture, based upon draft-wijnands-bier-architecture-04....\" I really think that this document should be Informational or PS, or something. I can understand the *work* to be experimental in nature, but the document *itself* seems like it shouldn't be - it doesn't (really) explain how to implement.
