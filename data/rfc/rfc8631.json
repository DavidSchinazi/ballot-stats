I also have some reservations about the \"status\" relation, or perhaps just with the way it is described.\u00a0 Section 1 implies that it is supposed to be about the status of the service as a whole, as opposed to potentially being limited to just the resource returning the link relation.\u00a0 Since web services, while widespread, are not universal, I would be reluctant to use such a generic term in the namespace for a more specific use case.\u00a0 The actual registration in Section 6.4 is more vague, though, talking just about the status of \"the context\", which I suppose could apply even to resources that are not part of a web service. It's quite possible I'm in the rough on one or both of those, in which case I'll happily clear.",
