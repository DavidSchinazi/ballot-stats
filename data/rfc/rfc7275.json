That will stop people \"expressing surprise\" and making claims of \"unwarranted piggybacking.\" While I accept that this information can be gleaned from the document, it is not really painted red. Perhaps add a short sentence to the Introduction (and not buried :-) saying something like.... This document assumes that it is normal to run LDP between the PEs in the RG, and that LDP components will in any case be present on the PEs to establish and maintain PWs. Therefore, ICCP is built as a secondary protocol running within LDP and taking advantage of the LDP session mechanisms and the underlying TCP and TCP-based security mechanisms already necessary for LDP operation. === I just so wish you hadn't made this \"LDP\" it shares so little with LDP that you might just as easily have made it a whole new protocol and saved all of the baggage and the strangeness that *will* happen when an implementation gets confused and sends a regular LDP message trying for a label.

And the protocol does involve sensitive operations on non-colocated nodes, so I think a bit more work on the security issues is needed. Presumably that will mean clarifying assumptions made (e.g. that all connections, local or remote are somehow \"secure\") and providing better references to existing mechanisms that can be used, so I'd like to DISCUSS that.\u00a0 I've broken that down into four parts below to help move that discussion along more quickly, but depending on the answer to point (1) in particular, it might turn out to make sense for me to restructure the discuss points, so we should I guess focus on that point first. (1) 3.3: What does \"transport security\" mean in requirement vii? (2) section 4: which layer handles \"transport security\"? How can that be done? (3) 10, para 2: \"MUST provide a mechanism\" does not say what mechanism - how can this be implemented and achieve interop?
