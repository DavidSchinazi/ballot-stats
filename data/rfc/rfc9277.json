Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points (mainly to generate discussion -- I will clear my DISCUSS most probably after discussion), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Christian Ams\u00fcss for the shepherd's write-up even if the justification for the intended status is somehow weak (but at least present).  I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: Just a normal DISCUSS based on the absence of  BCP14  and any normative language in a standard track document. Explanations from the authors/WG/AD will be more than welcome as I am not convinced by the shepherd's explanation (basically \"let's avoid down ref\").",
