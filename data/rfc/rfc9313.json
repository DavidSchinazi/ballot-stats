        "text": "Thank you for the work put into this document. The comparison between the IPv4aaS technologies is well done. Please find below some blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Ron Bonica for the shepherd's write-up and the justification for the intended status, I would have appreciated a little more text about the WG consensus though.  Authors may also expect an internet directorate review by Dave Lawrence, the delay in the review should not hinder the publication process though. Finally, I would like to apologise for not sending those comments earlier (just before telechat! there is NO need to reply immediately) but also during the WG process as I try to follow closely the V6OPS work. I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Section 2.2 A important and trivial to fix \"translates the IPv4 payload to public IPv4 source address using a stateful NAPT44\" => \"translates the IPv4 source address in the payload to public IPv4 source address using a stateful NAPT44\" ## Section 3.3 \"Here, the centralized network function (lwAFTR or BR) only needs to perform stateless encapsulation/decapsulation or NAT64\", actually in MAP-T, BR does translation. ## Section 3.4 I am afraid that the number of IPv4 public addresses that are required goes beyond this \"simple\" computation. There are also other constraints such as laws, MoU, rules and operators BCP, see: -  https://bipt.be/operators/publication/consultation-of-11-october-2016-regarding-the-conditions-of-use-of-ipv4cgn  (alas in French/Dutch) but meaning that in my country, Belgium, an IP address can be shared by 16 subscribers max -  https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online",
