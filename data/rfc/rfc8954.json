I\u2019m puzzled by this, so please explain: as long as we\u2019re talking about new clients, developed with this document in place, why shouldn\u2019t it be a MUST to use 32 octets?\u00a0 Why would a new client use 16 bits, rather than 32, and what are the considerations that the coder would need to understand in making that decision?",
