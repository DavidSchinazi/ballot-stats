I'll be back to Yes after that. In this text, \u00a0  The \"status\" member duplicates the information available in the HTTP \u00a0  status code itself, thereby bringing the possibility of disagreement \u00a0  between the two.\u00a0 Their relative precedence is not clear, since a \u00a0  disagreement might indicate that (for example) an intermediary has \u00a0  modified the HTTP status code in transit.\u00a0 As such, those defining \u00a0  problem types as well as generators and consumers of problems need to \u00a0  be aware that generic software (such as proxies, load balancers, \u00a0  firewalls, virus scanners) are unlikely to know of or respect the \u00a0  status code conveyed in this member. \u00a0   I understand what you're saying about a mismatch being possible, and some of the possible reasons why that might happen, but isn't this saying that anyone who can understand the \"status\" member should prefer its value when there's a mismatch (because it's less likely to have been dorked with by an intermediary - or is that even true)? So, the situation looks to me, like there's a MUST \u00a0  The status member, if present, is only advisory; it conveys the HTTP \u00a0  status code used for the convenience of the consumer.\u00a0 Generators \u00a0  MUST use the same status code in the actual HTTP response, to assure \u00a0  that generic HTTP software that does not understand this format still \u00a0  behaves correctly.\u00a0  that some intermediary can dork with, so the result violates the MUST, and we really can't tell the receiver what you should do at that point. \"Gee, I guess you're gonna have to flip a coin to decide who to believe\" would be sad, but it would be more guidance than the document has now :-)",
