If that is the case, then pause and resume will be done frequently and on short time scales due to variability of the link. And then the router resumes transmission to the modem when the buffer has been reduced? As this is enabled to be done on a queue level what how does one ensure the per hop behavior that is intended based on the DSCP with this split. Because you will get an interaction between the two queue that are in series for the same link which makes ensuring the PHB difficult.

Hypothetical Scenario: My next-door neighbor keeps using up all the bandwidth, making my Internets slow! Stupid neighbor! Until now I didn't have much motivation to mess with DLEP (it didn't really gain me anything), but now I can spoof Pause Data Items to get the router to stop sending traffic to her, freeing up all the bandwidth for me. The security considerations section doesn't *really* cover this -- it says:  \" Note that this extension does allow a compromised or impersonating modem to suppress transmission by the router, but this is not a substantively different attack by such a compromised modem simply dropping all traffic destined to, or sent by a router.\" -- that only covers compromised modems, not impersonating modems. It also says: \"[ RFC8175 ] defines the use of TLS to protect against the impersonating attacker.\" -- yes,  RFC8175  does indeed define the use of TLS, but doesn't require it. RFC8175  Security Considerations also say: \" This specification does not address security of the data plane, as it (the data plane) is not affected, and standard security procedures can be employed.\" and \"Similar issues can arise if DLEP data is used as an input to policing algorithms -- injection of malicious data via DLEP can cause those policing algorithms to make incorrect decisions, degrading network throughput.\" It seems that this specification is specifically allowing the dataplane to be affected by (spoofed) DLEP messages, and in a much more direct way than discussed in the  RFC8175  security considerations section. I think that this is dangerous without much more direct advice (like \"MUST use TLS\" or similar).",
