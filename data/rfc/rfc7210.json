For instance, if I had a box that had both IPsec and the proposed database, would there be some interaction or could information in the new database be used also for protocols such as IPsec?

You never define \"string\" in section 2, but you do say: \u00a0  To accommodate manual key management, the format of the fields has \u00a0  been purposefully chosen to allow updates with a plain text editor \u00a0  and to provide equivalent display on multiple systems. That reads to me like maybe these things are expected to be US-ASCII. But then you say: \u00a0  The AdminKeyName field contains a string identifying \u00a0  the key by humans. \u00a0   (Side comment: That's worded really badly. I think you mean \"The AdminKeyName field contains a human-readable string meant to identify the key for the user.\" Or something like that.) Do you intend the AdminKeyName to be internationalizable? If so, then here or 5.1 needs something more: \u00a0  5.1 Key Names \u00a0  When a key for a given protocol is identified by an integer key \u00a0  identifier, the associated key name will be represented as lower case \u00a0  hexadecimal integers with the most significant octet first.\u00a0 This \u00a0  integer is padded with leading 0's until the width of the key \u00a0  identifier field in the protocol is reached. \u00a0   What if they are *not* identified by an integer? (Can that happen?) In that case, do you want them to be Unicode characters? In some particular format?

I do think this will be a useful specification in the end and is a fine piece of work that's almost there - hopefully  my questions here will be easily resolved. (1) What'd happen if I merge two databases (e.g. if I buy some new bigger kit that replaces multiple devices) and the admin key name collides? Should you add a key-table-name property that should be selected so as to avoid collisions? (2) section 2: Having registries for KDFs and AlgIDs here seems wrong, or maybe I'm confused. Either the protocol that uses the DB will specify the KDF and AlgIDs or it will not. If it does, then any such registry will be part of the protocol itself. If it does not, then I don't see how I get interop without having a specificaiton for the input bits to the KDF, etc which are not always obvious and are not specified here. Either way, the KDF registry here seems useless given that there's a registry for the Protocol field. What am I missing?\u00a0  (3) section 2: Direction - How would you support a key with \"both\" here but that is used with a KDF and direction-specific KDF inputs?
