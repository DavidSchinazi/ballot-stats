        "text": "(1) I had the same thought when reading this as Stephen commented about in reference to whether all of this guidance makes sense for all URI schemes, or whether it is actually motivated by activity going on in relation to http: and https: and not other schemes. In general the guidance seems widely applicable but I'm a little uncomfortable assuming that there aren't any situations where sip: or tel: URIs might be used differently enough that deviating from what this document says has in the past or will in the future seem like the right thing to do. So it would be helpful to hear about why the guidance in this document makes sense for all URIs. (2) Section 2.1: \"A specification that defines substructure within a URI scheme MUST do \u00a0 \u00a0 so in the defining document for that URI scheme, or by modifying \u00a0 \u00a0 [ RFC4395 ].\" I don't understand the bit about modifying  RFC 4395 . First of all,  RFC 4395 is quite general, so it seems odd that a single prospective scheme specifier would go modify that document just to be able to define a substructure within a URI scheme. Furthermore, I'm wondering if the real point here is to say that once scheme substructures are initially defined, they cannot be modified in the future. I don't really read that anywhere in  RFC 4395 , but if that is the implication here, why not just make that statement another recommendation of this BCP, and skip the bit about modifying  RFC 4395 ?",

I'm concerned that this document reflects a few assumptions about URIs that look really odd when you compare them to what we normally assume about protocol fields. In general, this document seems to reverse an important implication.\u00a0 The following are not equivalent: \u00a0 protocol => format \u00a0 format => protocol The former is usually true; the latter usually false.\u00a0 Protocols define formats all the time -- that's 80% of what a protocol is.\u00a0 This document seems to assume, however, that just because one protocol uses a given format, then anything that uses that format belongs to that protocol.\u00a0  This seems like an assumption that we don't really make anywhere else.\u00a0 If an HTTP-based protocol were to require request bodies to have a particular content type, for example, it would be entirely non-controversial.\u00a0 We would not assume that all requests with that content type belonged to that protocol.\u00a0 Why are URIs privileged? In other words, this document says that it's OK for protocols to extract information from a URI, but they have to take what they get -- they can't require that the URIs have any particular format.\u00a0 This seems dramatically different from how other protocol fields are handled.\u00a0 Usually applications are free to examine received protocol elements however they like, and say \"No, that's not OK\" if they don't like the contents.\u00a0 Why are URIs privileged? Now, I don't entirely disagree with the risks called out in the document.\u00a0 There is a risk of confusion if you specify components in a URI, and there is a risk of rigidity if URIs are constrained in bad ways.\u00a0 My problem with this document is more with regard to how it approaches these risks.\u00a0 Rather than calling out these risks and advising protocol designers on how to avoid them -- while still allowing URIs to be structured by protocols, making informed trade-offs -- the document forces a risk judgement on all future protocols.",

Why won't this cause loads of argument later about so-and-so I-D that e.g. defines {whatever}/myapp being covered by this or not? Seems to me it will. I'll clear on this once you've responded, since we already have those arguments so we're no worse off in that respect with this, but I'd like to at least ask if you can better define the target specifications to which you want this BCP to apply. 2) 2.2: what about the port number in authority, doesn't that need a mention? 3) 2.3 says {whatever}/myapp is bad, and depends on the intro for why (\"operational difficulty\") but that part of the intro only IMO shows that collisions are bad, (see my comment below) which does not seem to justify the conclusion that this (fairly common) practice is really bad since {whatever} can be chosen to make collision probability as small as you like. I don't get the justification for this to be honest. 4) 2.4, 3rd para: is this outlawing the practice of defining how to handle your message as an HTTP form? E.g. as an alternative to a POST body. Is that a good plan? And why \"SHOULD NOT\" - when is it ok to do this? 5) section 3: I wondered which of these techniques is in wide-spread use? If none, then how is this credibly a BCP? Is it not the case that the techniques that are outlawed here are is more common use than those that are recommended?
