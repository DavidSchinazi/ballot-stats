        "text": "1. Section 5.1: To me it appears that one fundamental security flaw exists in the definition of the inner encryption. That is the fact that RTP padding is not included into the inner encrypted part. This prevents the application of RTP padding to prevent the potential privacy leakage that \"Guidelines for the Use of Variable Bit Rate Audio with Secure RTP\" ( RFC 6562 ) documents. To prevent this type of information leakage and other privacy preserving operations based on applying RTP padding it would be necessary to include the RTP padding into the inner encrypted envelope. Appendix A figure indicates that is the case, but the process description in 5.1 is not matching that.  2. Section 5.1:  \u00a0  1.\u00a0 Form an RTP packet.\u00a0 If there are any header extensions, they \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  MUST use [ RFC8285 ]. I got the impression from the framework that it was possible to have some header extension being encrypted using the inner key as (Section 4:3) says:  \u00a0  If there is a need to encrypt one or more RTP header extensions end- \u00a0  to-end, the endpoint derives an encryption key from the E2E SRTP \u00a0  master key to encrypt header extensions as per [ RFC6904 ].  That is missing from this step as it can't be applied in step 4. And shouldn't the headers protected in this fashion with the inner keys be part of the authenticated synthetic packet?  3. Section 5.2:  This is minor but still a significant inconsistency:  \u00a0  3.\u00a0 A Media Distributor can add information to the OHB, but MUST NOT \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  change existing information in the OHB.\u00a0 If RTP value is changed \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  and not already in the OHB, then add it with its original value \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  to the OHB. 4.\u00a0 If the Media Distributor resets a parameter to its original \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  value, it MAY drop it from the OHB.\u00a0 Note that this might result \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  in a decrease in the size of the OHB. So reseting back to original value, is according to 3 not allowed. I think the MUST NOT is wrongly formulated. I assume that the point is that any field value carrying an original value MUST NOT be changed, however, if the field is changed back to its original value, the value SHALL/SHOULD be removed from the OHB? 4. Section 5.2:  ... SHOULD use an independent salt for each recipient, Is that possible on any other legs than MD to MD? What has been statated is that all end-point are required to use the same sal for a session as that is not included in the EKT. Putting a SHOULD requirement on something that is not possbile appears counter productive.  5. Section 7.1: This section fails to make it clear why RTX packets are retransmitting the double encrypted packets. In normal application of SRTP the buffered packet and what is used for constructing the RTX packet is the unencrypted one. Thus the equivalent for an MD would be to handle the Inner protected only in its cache. Is the reason that an endpoint that recovers a packet anyway have to pass it through the double decryption process and thus it is to avoid a exception case for the endpoint? If that is the case, please note it in the text.  6. Section 7.2: I fail to see how one can follow this procedure and generate anything that is workable. The reasons is that that the primary encoding and each of multiple redundancy encoding all share the same SSRC and have no independent sequence number space or timestamp space. Thus, I don't see how it is possible to create inner encrypted payloads for each of the primary and redundnacy encoding without two time pads. Why wasn't the simple choice applied here. That is to treat RED as a single endpoint to endpoint format. Thus making it robust if packets are lost on the path, but the MD's can't recreate a packet based on a redundancy paylaod and inject that instead.  I don't see how that this is a correct statement. As RED does not have different SSRCs for the different media encodings what it does can't be represented in FlexFEC.     \"Note that Flex FEC [ I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme ] is a \u00a0  superset of the capabilities of RED.\u00a0 For most applications, FlexFEC \u00a0  is a better choice than RED.\" 7. Section 9:  \tWhen this is done, the cryptographic \u00a0  contexts used for decryption and re-encryption MUST use different, \u00a0  independent master keys and master salts.    \tRelated to discuss item 4 and here at different  RFC 2119  levels.    8. Section 9. The use of AES-GCM as symmetric algorithms results in that the source authication level for the inner part has a limited scope, in that any endpoint can create a double protected packet, not only the one that which SSRC it is as there are no cryptographic protection on that level. I think that point is significant for something that is primarily targeting group communication scenarios.",
