Measurements like those done by Geoff Huston/Joao Damas ( http://iepg.org/2022-03-20-ietf113/huston-v6frag.pdf ) and those contained in  draft-vyncke-v6ops-james  make me dubious that HbH options will reliable in the Internet in any sort of reasonable timeframe. In addition, I'm dubious that operators will be willing to enable HbH processing to enable this mechanism, and, while this HbH option *itself* may be implementable in the fast-path, enabling processing of HbH to find this option seems likely to often require punting the packet, and may also make finding the L4 information harder. Finally, I'm still not clear how exactly the signal should be interpreted next to other MTU mechanisms - if only a small number of devices actually implement and process this, it doesn't really remove the need for other mechanisms, and the performance hit for enabling it (and having HbH containing packets dropped) seems like it would likely outweigh the gains.  With all of that said, this *is* Experimental, and does mention many of my concerns. It also talks about applicability in \"environments where there is control over the hosts and nodes that connect them\", and so where operators may be willing to enable this because they know what sort of traffic exists. In addition, it's entirely possible that I'm wrong (I often am), and that this experiment will turn out to be wildly successful, and soon almost every router will do this -- and, if so, I'll be really happy! In summary, I'm Abstaining, knowing that the document will progress, and hoping that it will be successful; ultimately, like most Abstains, it is a virtue-signaling no-op.",
