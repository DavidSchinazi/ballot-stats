And of course, that is the primary purpose of a Standards Track document. Most concerning is the mixture of actual requirements language, with language that's only exemplary -- I found it impossible to determine exactly what parts I have to strictly follow in order to produce a compliant implementation. Rather than call out any particular issue here, I refer to the comments section for my various specific points about Section 3.3.1. Let's discuss those, make any changes you agree to, or you can make the case that it's fine as it stands. That is to say, I don't expect this DISCUSS to be blocking in the long term, rather it's here to make sure we do have the discussion. Thanks!",
