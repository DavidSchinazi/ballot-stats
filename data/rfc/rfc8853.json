I have found a blocking issue that I believe should be easy to address; but (due to the potential impact on interoperability) document publication does need to be blocked pending resolution of this issue. The problem is that the SDP examples in this document are not consistent with the syntax and semantics defined in draft-ietf-mmusic and  draft-ietf-avtext-rid , as described below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a74, Figure 1: >\u00a0 a=rid:1 send pt=97 max-width=1280;max-height=720 >\u00a0 a=rid:2 send pt=98 max-width=320;max-height=180 >\u00a0 a=rid:3 send pt=99 max-width=320;max-height=180 >\u00a0 a=rid:4 recv pt=97 The final syntax for RID ended up with PT being treated the same as other parameters, and therefore requiring a semicolon delimiter between it and stream restrictions.

Please adjust them to be 1 and 2 instead of 5 and 6. Also, if LPC is inteded to be used with the first RID (as is suggested by the text above the example), then your \"pt\" value needs to be \"pt=99,102,98\" -- otherwise, the RID will prevent the use of PT 98.
