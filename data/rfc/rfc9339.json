        "text": "I am balloting DISCUSS because I believe that the behavior specified in this document is not clear enough.\u00a0 I think these points should be easy to address. (1) The main behavior in this document (using the reverse metric) is covered in the following sentences: \u00a76: \u00a0  A router receiving a Hello packet from its neighbor that contains the \u00a0  Reverse Metric TLV on a link SHOULD use the RM value to derive the \u00a0  metric for the link to the advertising router in its Router-LSA... \u00a0  ... \u00a0  The neighbor SHOULD use the reverse TE metric value... \u00a77: \u00a0  Implementations SHOULD NOT accept the RM from its neighbors by default  \u00a0  and SHOULD provide a configuration option to enable the acceptance of  \u00a0  the RM from neighbors on specific links. For all cases, why is this behavior recommended and not required?\u00a0 When is it ok to not use the RM, or to accept it by default? (2) \u00a76: \u00a0  A router stops including the Reverse Metric TLV in its Hello packets \u00a0  when it needs its neighbors to go back to using their own provisioned \u00a0  metric values.\u00a0 When this happens, a router that had modified its \u00a0  metric in response to receiving a Reverse Metric TLV from its \u00a0  neighbor should revert to using its provisioned metric value. No normative language is used here -- should there be a SHOULD/MUST there? Even if \"should revert\" is used, the behavior is unclear and could be interpreted as not required.",

A naive reading of Sec 2.2 implies that a router could generate reverse-metric TLVs quite rapidly, triggering a storm of TLVs from a potentially large number of neighbors. Each reverse metric advertisement generates N LSAs, increasing the amplification of any sort of misconfiguration or misbehavior far more than a traditional LSAs that is updated too often. At the very least, this ought to come up in security considerations, but I wonder if applying some sort of rate limit (beyond which neighbors are free to ignore) would be a firmer way of limiting the problem. I'm flexible on the best way forward.",

your first use case, when considering that the proposal is for per link configuration for the acceptance of RM from neighbours.\u00a0 This would seem to suggest that before you can make use of reverse-metric you have to already have determined the links on the affected devices to then configure them to accept the reverse-metrics, at which point, doesn't this partially defeat the use case?\u00a0 Or is the main goal to simplify the coordination of changing the metric at both ends of the link at the same time?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

\u00a0 \u00a0   Or is the intention that during the maintenance window the operators would enable the \"allow receipt of reverse-metrics\" on all links within, say, an area?\u00a0 If so, would hierarchical device and area specific configuration be more appropriate?\u00a0 E.g., allow it to be enabled/disbaled on individual links, but also allow more coarse grained configuration. Not as an update for this document, but I am assuming that the LSR working group with eventually update or augment the OSPF YANG module with standard configuration to support this feature. (2) p 8, sec 7.\u00a0 Operational Guidelines \u00a0  For the use case in Section 2.1, it is RECOMMENDED that the network \u00a0  operator limits the period of enablement of the reverse metric \u00a0  mechanism to be only the duration of a network maintenance window. Presumably this isn't feasible when the CE is not managed by the provider?\u00a0 In this scenario, is the expectation that the configuration to accept reverse-metrics would just be left always enabled on the CE device?\u00a0 Is this a security concern?
