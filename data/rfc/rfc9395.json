Can the IETF actually deprecate / make a protocol historic? (as stated in \"Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) has been deprecated\" and \"IKEv1 has been moved to Historic status.\") I agree that **making the documents that describe these** be historic is the right thing to do, and also that the IETF can strongly recommend that people don't use/deploy/whatever IKEv1, but I don't really know if we (or anyone) have the power to deprecate a protocol. We are not the protocol police, and we cannot instruct people to e.g deploy protocol foo, so I don't know if we can deprecate a protocol either -- but I suspect that this might be because I don't actually know what \"IKEv1 has been deprecated\" actually *means*. Again, I'm not trying to block what this document is attempting to *do*, but rather make it clear what it is actually doing.",
