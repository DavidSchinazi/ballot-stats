        "text": "Section 12.5 contains the following normative statement: >\u00a0 Furthermore, because most languages are typically >\u00a0 represented by a single script or a small set of scripts, and >\u00a0 because most scripts are typically contained in one or more >\u00a0 blocks of code points, the software SHOULD warn the user when >\u00a0 presenting a string that mixes code points from more than one >\u00a0 script or block, or that uses code points outside the normal >\u00a0 range of the user's preferred language(s). This guidance seems broadly unimplementable for any users whose native language uses a non-Latin script. Due in large part to the Internet's ASCII heritage, and combined with the somewhat ubiquitous use of Latin characters for other worldwide purposes (e.g., a quick perusal of Russian- and Chinese-language web sites shows numerous examples of Latin representations for things like stock ticker symbols and metric abbreviations), it seems that the normative requirement to warn when \"presenting a string that... uses code points outside the normal range of the user's preferred language(s)\" will *either* warn non-Latin-character users almost constantly (if Latin is considered outside the range), or be broadly useless in preventing spoofing (if it is). I'm not clever enough to come up with a generalized solution for users of all alphabets, so don't have a generic proposal here; but I think that the guidance does at least need to be properly scoped so that it bears only on warning Latin alphabet users of the presence of non-Latin characters, while acknowledging that it is probably rather useless when used in the opposite direction. I imagine that it still makes sense to warn non-Latin users of non-Latin characters outside the codepoints used by their language (e.g., warning Greek speakers of the presence of Cyrillic characters).",
