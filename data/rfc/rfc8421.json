I think it's fine to put this in ICEbis, but if this draft is going to reference it then it actually needs to be specified there. Alternatively, if this text is meant to reference the discussion further down in Section 5, I wouldn't call that modifying the formula, but rather providing guidance about how to set local preferences within the formula.",
