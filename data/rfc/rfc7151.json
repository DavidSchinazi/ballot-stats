However, before recommending the approval I wanted to ask for clarification on two points to make sure that implementors can read this spec accurately. I had trouble understanding what the \"chooses not conform\" on page 17 means. Did you mean \"chooses not to use\"?  Similarly, on page 18, I did not understand this: \"a server implementation MUST treat an additional HOST command that was sent before a user has been authenticated as though a previous HOST command was not sent.\" Can you clarify?",
