        "text": "1. The notion of application is not clear, and lead to some ambiguities. Example 1: OLD: IANA registries are created in a separate document. NEW: IANA registries are created in a separate document, application-specific. Example 2: you don't say that reputon are application-specific. This is a key concept Example 3: \u00a0  One of the key properties of a Response Set is called an Assertion. \u00a0  Assertions are claims made about the subject of a reputation query. \u00a0  For example, one might assert that a particular restaurant serves \u00a0  good food.\u00a0 In the context of this model, the assertion would be \u00a0  \"serves good food\". Isn't it? \u00a0  In the context of this model, the assertion would be \u00a0  \"serves good food\" for the application \"restaurant\"? Because I guess that \"serves good food\" is not valid for email You see, an application definition and explaining that reputon are per application would clarify a lot of things. 2. The document discussed the Response Set, but doesn't tell what is contained in the Query (*) So I can only guess that the application is part of query. Explaining what MUST/SHOULD/MAY be part of the query and reply are important topics for an architecture document. Also, can I query: get me all the reputons you know about the application \"application context = X\" and \"identity = Y\". I'm asking for good food, but I might interested to know that they have good wine, or slow service, etc... It's a basic answer the architecture document should be answering (**) (*) is this  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-query-http/  section 3.1 \u00a0 \u00a0 The components to the question being asked comprise the following: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o\u00a0 The subject of the query; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o\u00a0 The name of the host, or the IP address, at which the reputation \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 service is available; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o\u00a0 The name of the reputation application, i.e., the context within \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 which the subject is being evaluated; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  o\u00a0 Optionally, name(s) of the specific reputation assertions or \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 attributes that are being requested. (**) I eventually found the information in  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-media-type/ \u00a0  If a client makes a \u00a0  request about a subject but does not specify an assertion of \u00a0  interest, the server can return reputons about any assertion for \u00a0  which it has data; in effect, the client has asked for any available \u00a0  information about the subject.\u00a0 A client that receives an irrelevant \u00a0  reputon simply ignores it. 3. \u00a0  Each application requires its own specification of the Response Set. What I understand now (after speaking to Pete who clarified a few things for me) is that each application requires its own registry, with its own set of reputons, but not necessary its own new protocol, with its own new encoding.  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-query-http/  is one example of protocol encoding, and this could be reused.  This was very confusing to me. It seems that there are good piece of information in the different drafts to solve the points 2 and 3 (without rewriting or cutting and pasting a lot of information between the different drafts, which would be ideal solution obviously), but those drafts are not even referenced. At the very minimum, you would need pointers like the following: \u00a0  The key pieces of data found in a reputon for all reputation \u00a0  applications are defined in  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-media-type/  section 3.1 \u00a0  The ABNF syntax of a reputon is specified in  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-media-type/  section XXX \u00a0   \u00a0  Some good examples (and you would need these to understand this architecture: OK, no need to mention this :-)) \u00a0  are specified at  http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-media-type/  section 6.2 \u00a0   http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-repute-query-http/  specifies one example of protocol encoding:  \u00a0  over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol using JSON as the payload meta-format. Other encodings could be envisaged.  \u00a0   draft-ietf-repute-media-type  must be normative, right? Bottom line: assuming that the architecture draft is the first draft a newcomer to the repute work will read, it lacks some key pieces of information. And this information is spread across the different drafts. Once you have the different pointers, I advice you to review the 4 drafts\u00a0 with the fresh mind of a newcomer, and if the story is complete. Therefore, this DISCUSS is valid for the set of 4 repute documents.",
