(Sometimes they do, but not always.)\u00a0 Shouldn't the examples be consistent with the protocol requirements?\u00a0 I note some examples in my COMMENT section but this should not be treated as an exhaustive list. A similar property (again, if I understand correctly) holds for the \"parent\" attribute of various elements (which is definitely only a thing for the CSV objects).. The claim in the IANA Considerations regarding \"URI assignments have been registered by the IANA\", accompanied by specific URN namespace/schema values, is codepoint squatting, in the absence of a disclaimer about being \"requested values\".\u00a0 The registration policy is only Specification Required, so there is no formal guarantee that we can actually get these values. At least one of the examples shows RSA/MD5 DNSSEC key records.\u00a0 RSA/MD5 usage is specifically disallowed (see  RFC 6944  and  RFC 8624 ); please replace with a more modern algorithm.\u00a0 (One location noted in the COMMENT, along with some SHA-1 usage that should probably go as well.)",
