I'd suggest maybe adding a note here (possibly an IESG note, or just more text before 1.1, whatever), that says something like: \"This DTLS solution was considered by the DPRIVE working group as an option to use in case the TLS based approach specified in RFC7858  turns out to have some issues when deployed.\u00a0 At the time of writing, it is expected that  RFC7858  is what will be deployed, and so this specification is mainly intended as a backup.\" Note that while text like that may also end up in the profiles document, I still think it may be useful here as well. (2) Section 4: No mention of OCSP stapling? And come to think of it, how would non-stapled OCSP even work? And since I've now thought of it, how will OCSP work with RFC7858 ? Does this (and 7858) need to mandate stapling or no revocation checking via OCSP at all?\u00a0 (Apologies for not asking about that when we were processing 7858;-)",
