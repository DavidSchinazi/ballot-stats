        "text": "I have cleared my original DISCUSS point from my earlier review -- I get what the text is saying now, although I still think the \"lose the option\" language implies some entitlement to the option in the first place, which seems inappropriate. But given the reviews from Martin Thomson and Christian Huitema, it's not clear to me that this document represents the consensus view of the IETF community. Kathleen's response to Martin reinforces the point that we were discussing in the first ballot cycle, which is that this document is written for and represents operators, not the broader array of Internet interests. Yet the suggestion to state that fact up front in the document was not adopted. Having had some more time to review this document than I had in the previous ballot cycle, I also am finding myself in agreement with significant portions of the reviews from Martin and Christian. Reading their reviews helped crystallize a lot of the difficulty I had in parsing this document the first time around.  I understand the rationale that led to this document being written and I think there is a version of this document that could be written that would achieve the original goals while giving the subject matter a readable, neutral treatment. Such a version would be a useful contribution. But I don't think this document achieves that. In particular, there are four things that I think it would need to do to achieve that: 1. State the analysis in a neutral way. As I had mentioned in one of the email threads for the previous ballot cycle, I believe this document could be written in a neutral way -- e.g., \u201cService providers currently do X. It is implemented using Y mechanism. Encryption at Z layer breaks current implementations.\u201d -- but it is not. Instead it characterizes many of the practices described as \"optimizations\" or \"features\" or \"enrichment\" and states service providers' claims about what these practices accomplish (e.g., \"maximize QOE\") as facts rather than stating them as the reasons given by service providers for why they engage in the practices. This is why in the previous round I suggested the disclaimer at the top of the document to say that the document is giving a view from service providers; that apparently didn't go anywhere, so the other option is to describe each technique neutrally, or explain with each technique that the characterization of the benefits is from the view of the operator. Martin's comments about being clear about who is benefitting point this out as well. 2. Limit the discussion to techniques presently being affected and those effects. There is a bunch of extemporizing about future possible impacts (e.g., in Sec. 2.7, 4.1.2, 4.1.3.1, 5.7, 7, 8). It's very hard to characterize future implications, who will bear the \"cost\" for what, whether increases in user complaints to various parties are \"worth it,\" etc., in a way that is perceived as neutral by all affected parties. Better not to make predictions if the goal is to give a neutral treatment of network functions being impacted today. 3. Acknowledge the controversy. Many of the practices described in this document are controversial, and have been for a long time. There is nothing wrong with that. I agree with Christian that it would be better to state an understanding of that head-on rather than leave it to the reader to decide whether any particular characterization of something described implies an endorsement of it. This has been done before, even in potentially controversial documents that this document references, e.g.  RFC 3135 . 4. Structure the document in a way that is consistent and logical with minimal repetition. It seems like there are multiple ways that this could be done. Organizing based on use case (per Christian) and then discussing techniques used within each use case is one way; organizing based on technique while mentioning the goals for which each technique is employed is another. At present the document is jumble of these.",

        "text": "Many thanks for all the effort that has gone in to addressing all the comments from the last IESG review and from the community. I find this version to be much improved from the last time the IESG reviewed it. However, I do not feel that I can support the publication of the document. While the tone has improved in many places and the introduction does a better job of contextualizing the document, the document still contains text in several sections that states service providers' claims about their practices as facts rather than stating them as claims or presenting the practices in a neutral way. This was a point raised in my previous DISCUSS (I've included my previous DISCUSS ballot text below in full for reference). In the previous review round Warren had invited recommendations for places where the tone or choice of words could be made more neutral or balanced, and I provided many detailed suggestions, but a number of those were not adopted. I also realize that the introduction contains much of the disclaimer text we previously hashed out to try to address this, but it doesn't contain all of it. So this is still a major issue for the document, IMO. The document also still extemporizes about future possible impacts, making it hard to come away with a neutral view of their treatment, as I noted in my previous DISCUSS ballot. I support the DISCUSS position held by Ekr. But given the above I don't think it will be fruitful for me to continue to engage on the details of this document, so I'm abstaining. I've included below some of the areas that I still find problematic, as well as some nits. Problematic areas: = Section 2.1.2 = (1) \"Network operators are often the first ones called upon to investigate \u00a0  application problems\" I still contend that without data to back this up, this claim should not be made, especially for the enterprise context. (2) \"Vendors must be aware that in order for operators to better \u00a0  troubleshoot and manage networks with increasing amounts of encrypted \u00a0  traffic, built-in diagnostics and serviceability must be enhanced to \u00a0  provide detailed logging and debugging capabilities that, when \u00a0  possible, can reveal cleartext network parameters.\" If I try to paraphrase this it sounds like \"vendors should build in capabilities to decrypt encrypted traffic.\" Was that the intent? = Section 2.2.4 = I agree with Christian Huitema's unresolved comments on this section. In the thread regarding his comments Kathleen said \"we don't want to make general statements that aren't necessarily true\" -- IMO that is what the middle three paragraphs in this section are doing. At a minimum, I think the characterizations about the effects of performance-enhancing proxies needs to be qualified by saying \"some operators find that ...\" rather than stating their effects as fact. = Section 2.2.7 = \"There is work in progress to specify protocols that permit Service \u00a0  Function Chaining (SFC).\" I don't think it makes sense to have this forward-looking statement when Section 1 states that \"This document describes practices currently used by network operators to manage, operate, and secure their networks.\" I think it makes sense to focus this section on how existing SFC deployments have stopped functioning because of increased use of encrypted traffic, but it seems unfair to claim that some future, yet-to-deployed functionality will be broken. = Section 2.3.2 = \"As a \u00a0  result, some mobile carriers block customer's encrypted requests, \u00a0  which is a far less optimal customer experience because the blocking \u00a0  reason must be conveyed by some other means.\" This could easily be read to imply that sending requests in cleartext is optimal. Overall, the use of the words \"usual,\" \"optimal,\" and \"often\" in this section imply a level of generality that is unwarranted I think.  = Section 5.6 = The implications for SAVI seem speculative unless you can point to SAVI deployments that have been impacted by increased use of encryption. Nits: = Abstract = s/Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users is \u00a0  of serious concern/Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users are of serious concern/ = Section 2.1.2 = (1) \"Further, the performance of some services can be more efficiently \u00a0  managed and repaired when information on user transactions is \u00a0  available to the service provider.\u00a0 It may be possible to continue \u00a0  such monitoring activities without clear text access to the \u00a0  application layers of interest ...\" It's not clear what \"such monitoring\" refers to, since the previous sentence is about performance management and service repair. (2) Is \"User/Service Key Quality Indicators\" a term of art? It seems weird to be capitalized. = Section 2.2.3 = This section seems like it was left in the document by mistake. = Section 2.3 = \"As previously stated, the intent of this document is to \u00a0  document existing practices, the development of IETF protocols \u00a0  follows the guiding principles of [ RFC1984 ] and [ RFC2804 ].\" Is that comma supposed to be a period? I'm not following the grammar here. = Section 2.3.1 = s/However, the lack of ability to efficiently manage \u00a0  endpoints as a service reduces providers' ability to offer parental \u00a0  control./However, the lack of ability to efficiently manage \u00a0  endpoints as a service reduces network service providers' ability to offer parental \u00a0  control./ = Section 4.1.2 = It seems like a single reference to  RFC 8250  would suffice. = Section 7.4 = What is a trusted transit proxy? ---------------------------------------------------------------- Previous DISCUSS ballot text: I have cleared my original DISCUSS point from my earlier review -- I get what the text is saying now, although I still think the \"lose the option\" language implies some entitlement to the option in the first place, which seems inappropriate.

        "text": "I do not believe that this document represents IETF Consensus, largely for the reasons indicated by Martin Thomson and Christian Huitema on the IETF list recently. Specifically, this document, while perhaps not saying anything actually false, essentially only presents the perspective of operators and service providers. In many cases, those interests are adverse to those of users -- and in many cases encryption is used specifically to prevent operators from providing the \"services\" and \"enhancements\" contemplated by this document.\u00a0 For these reasons, I don't believe that the uncritical treamtent of these activities presented in this document should be published as an RFC that claims to have IETF Consensus. I have made specific comments below that indicate some of the more serious issues, but the problems here are systematic and require more than simple edits. S 1. \u00a0  draft includes a collection of \u00a0  current security and network management functions The functions presented here in many cases go far beyond security and management. For instance, header enrichment is neither, except by stretching the definition of \"management\" to breaking. S 2. \u00a0  middle boxes were in use to perform functions that range from load \u00a0  balancing techniques to monitoring for attacks or enabling \"lawful \u00a0  intercept\", such that described in [ETSI101331] and [CALEA] in the \u00a0  US. I'm not sure why you are mentioning CALEA here. As far as I can tell, the CALEA requirements only apply to carriers who have access to the keying material. \u00a0  The loss of access to these fields may \u00a0  prompt undesirable security practices in order to gain access to the \u00a0  fields in unencrypted data flows. As Martin Thomson indicates, this feels like a threat. S 2.1. As Martin and Christian indicate, this QUIC material is entirely speculative and extremely controversial and you should remove it. \u00a0  Additionally, a system that is able to encode the identity of the \u00a0  pool server in plain text information available in each incoming \u00a0  packet is able to provide stateless load balancing. This doesn't have to be in plaintext because the pool load balancer has a relationship with the servers. We already have designs for this for QIC. \u00a0  Current protocols, such as TCP, allow the development of stateless \u00a0  integrated load balancers by availing such load balancers of \u00a0  additional plain text information in client-to-server packets.\u00a0 (In \u00a0  case of TCP, such information can be encoded by having server- \u00a0  generated sequence numbers, mss values, lengths of the packet sent, \u00a0  etc.) How does this help the load balancer direct traffic. S 2.2. \u00a0  Internet traffic surveys are useful in many well-intentioned \"Well-intentioned\" is pretty tendentious here. \u00a0  pursuits, such as CAIDA data [CAIDA] and SP network design and \u00a0  optimization. I'd be interested in hearing which CAIDA studies are impacted by content encryption. Do you have citations? S 2.3.2.1. There are two kinds of caching potentially in play: - Explicit caches - Intercepting caches At this point, what ISPs primarily run is intercepting caches, and there's a lot of evidence that they contribute to bustage and ossification, as well as being a primary tool for ISPs to use to mess with people's traffic in ways that users clearly don't want (ad/tracking injection, etc.).\u00a0 So, I don't think an IETF consensus document should suggest that we are sad to be breaking them. S 2.3.2.2. The presentation here seems biased given that it does not acknowledge that one of the primary reasons that ISPs do traffic class discrimination is to prioritize favored rather than disfavored traffic, regardless of user preferences. I don't believe that the IETF has taken a position for net neutrality, but I'm also pretty sure we don't have consensus against it. S 2.5.3. Currently, the mobile network service provider redirects the customer \u00a0  using HTTP redirect to a page which educates the customer on the \u00a0  reason for the blockage and provide steps to proceed.\u00a0 Once the HTTP \u00a0  header and content are encrypted, the Mobile carrier loses the option \u00a0  to intercept the traffic and perform an HTTP redirect.\u00a0 With current \u00a0  solution options, this leaves only the option to block the customer\u2019s \u00a0  request and cause a bad customer experience until the blocking reason \u00a0  can be conveyed by some other means. This is pretty tendentious. It's not at all clear to me that the customer thinks that having their traffic intercepted is a better experience. S 2.6.2. Zero-rating is absolutely possible in the face of encryption. Facebook Free Basics supports this. https://info.internet.org/en/blog/2015/09/24/enhancing-security-and-privacy-of-free-basics/ S 2.6.5. Header insertion is also used for tracking and advertising. S 2.7. This should be clearer about the impact of encryption at various layers. Most of the things you want to do here will work fine with HTTPS. S 2.8. \u00a0  When utilizing increased encryption, application server operators \u00a0  should expect to be called upon more frequently to diagnose problems Why would this be true? As far as I can tell, pretty much only if they are screwing with the traffic in ways that the user would prefer they not. S 3.3.1. \u00a0  The general monitoring needs for data replication are described in \u00a0  this subsection. It's not at all obvious these are needs. S 4.1.1. A lot of these monitoring applications could also be characterized as the employer conducting surveillance on its employees. S 4.2. As far as I know, the MITM techniques used by middleboxes are not described in 7457. You also need to cover the fact that these MITM are a threat to user security because they are often so badly implemented. \u00a0  Restrictions on traffic to approved sites: Web proxies are sometimes \u00a0  used to filter traffic, allowing only access to well-known sites \u00a0  found to be legitimate and free of malware on last check by a proxy \u00a0  service company.\u00a0 This type of restriction is usually not noticeable \u00a0  in a corporate setting, but may be to those in research who are \u00a0  unable to access colleague\u2019s individual sites or new web sites that \u00a0  have not yet been screened. I'm not sure why this would be not noticeable in a corporate setting. I, for one, notice it on airplanes. S 5.3. It's pretty odd to talk about phishing without acknowledging that by far the largest anti-phishing platform (Safe Browsing) operates in the client, not be network interception. S 7.1 This entire section is pretty confusing. Issues include: - There is real debate about whether performance-enhancing proxies \u00a0 really work (see Mathis's comments at IETF). - Content replication needs a lot more than just being able to see \u00a0 ACKs. - \"trusted\" proxies? Trusted by who? This whole architectural structure of having invisible proxies messing with the transport stream is a total violation of the E2E argument, so I don't see how one could think that describing it as if it were positive can have IETF consensus. I also notice that this section and the sectoin below describe things that a lot of users don't want as \"features\" S 7.3. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Content/Application based Prioritization of Over-the-Top (OTT) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  services - each application-type or service has different \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  delay/loss/throughput expectations, and each type of stream will \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  be unknown to an edge device if encrypted; this impedes dynamic- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  QoS adaptation. I think there's a lot of debate about whether we *want* networks to try to accommodate new traffic classes. This has lead to a lot of problems under the heading of \"ossification\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While CDNs that de-encrypt flows or split-connection proxy \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  (similar to split-tcp) could be deployed closer to the edges to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  reduce control loop RTT, with transport header encryption, such \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  CDNs perform optimization functions only for partner client \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  flows; thus content from Small-Medium Businesses (SMBs) would not \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  get such CDN benefits. Huh? Lots of SMBs use this kind of CDN. That's how e.g., Cloudflare works. Heck the IETF uses it. S 8. \u00a0  In the best case scenario, engineers and other innovators would work \u00a0  to solve the problems at hand in new ways rather than prevent the use \u00a0  of encryption.\u00a0 It will take time to devise alternate approaches to \u00a0  achieve similar goals. Much of the context of this debate is about whether operators not being able to do the things in this document is a problem. \u00a0  It is well known that national surveillance programs monitor traffic \u00a0  for terrorism [JNSLP] I concur with Martin's objection to the use of the loaded word \"terrorism\" here. Given  RFC 2804  and the IETF's clear position on protocol design, this discussion of balance between surveillance and user security seems completely outside the IETF consensus.   \u00a0  Open questions: As the use of encryption increases, does passive \u00a0  monitoring become limited to metadata analysis?\u00a0 What metadata should \u00a0  be left in protocols as they evolve to also protect users privacy? Huh? Coming as this does in the context of surveillance, 2804 is clear. It might be the case that there are good reasons to avoid encrypting metadata for the purposes of network monitoring by carriers, but I think the IETF consensus is clearly not to do so to enable surveillance.",

Unfortunately, the fundamental concern that motivated my DISCUSS remains: I do not believe that this document matches the consensus of the IETF community. Specifically, this document takes at face value a large number of claims about the necessity/value of certain practices that either are controversial within the IETF or that there is, I believe, rough consensus to be actively bad, and that in many cases, encryption is specifically designed to prevent. I have noted a number of these below, but I do not believe that this is an exhaustive list (going through my previous DISCUSS, I see that I noted a number of these but that still appear to be unaddressed.) DISCUSS \u00a0  session encryption that deployed more easily instead of no \u00a0  encryption. \u00a0   I think I understand what you are saying here, but the term \"breakable\" seems very unfortunate, especially in the context of this document. The only such shift I am aware of that has received acceptance in IETF is one from always requiring fully authenticated encryption to allowing unauthenticated encryption, which you document in the next paragraph. I recognize that there are other perspectives (e.g., those in draft-rhrd) but those are pretty far from IETF consenus. Accordingly, I think you should remove this sentence. \u00a0  motivation outside of privacy and pervasive monitoring that are \u00a0  driving end-to-end encryption for these content providers. \u00a0   This section seems kind of confusing, at least as applied to HTTP. There are three kinds of cache in HTTP: - Reverse proxy caches (the kind CDNs run) - Explicit forward proxy caches - \"Transparent\" intercepting caches The first of these move to HTTPS just fine and that's typically how CDNs do it.\u00a0 Explicit forward proxy caches are largely going away, but part of the point of this kind of end-to-end encryption is to hide data from those caches.\u00a0 Transparent intercepting caches that the user didn't opt into are a bad thing, so having them go away is a positive. \u00a0  document existing practices, the development of IETF protocols \u00a0  follows the guiding principles of [ RFC1984 ] and [ RFC2804 ]. \u00a0   This is pretty opaque in this context.

As far as I know, the MITM techniques used by middleboxes are not described in 7457. You also need to cover the fact that these MITM are a threat to user security because they are often so badly implemented. S 5.4. It's pretty odd to talk about phishing without acknowledging that by far the largest anti-phishing platform (Safe Browsing) operates in the client, not be network interception. \u00a0 \u00a0 The transport header encryption prevents trusted transit proxies.\u00a0 It \u00a0  may be that the benefits of such proxies could be achieved by end to \u00a0   You don't define a \"trusted transit proxy\" so I don't know what this means, and whether they provide any benefit, but this certainly sounds euphemistic. Generally, \"trusted\" is not an adjective we associate with network proxies operated by third parties. \u00a0  In the best case scenario, engineers and other innovators would work \u00a0  to solve the problems at hand in new ways rather than prevent the use \u00a0  of encryption.\u00a0 As stated in [ RFC7258 ], \"an appropriate balance \u00a0  (between network management and PM mitigations) will emerge over time \u00a0  as real instances of this tension are considered.\" Much of the context of this debate is about whether operators not being able to do the things in this document is a problem, and this seems to presume the answer. \u00a0  This optimization at network edges measurably improves real-time \u00a0  transmission over long delay Internet paths or networks with large \u00a0   Do you have a citation for this claim? \u00a0  Web proxies are sometimes used to filter traffic, allowing only \u00a0  access to well-known sites found to be legitimate and free of malware \u00a0  on last check by a proxy service company.\u00a0 This type of restriction \u00a0  is usually not noticeable in a corporate setting as the typical \u00a0  corporate user does not access sites that are not well-known to these \u00a0  tools, but may be noticeable to those in research who are unable to \u00a0  access colleague's individual sites or new web sites that have not \u00a0  yet been screened.\u00a0 In situations where new sites are required for \u00a0  access, they can typically be added after notification by the user or \u00a0  proxy log alerts and review.\u00a0 Home mail account access may be blocked \u00a0  in corporate settings to prevent another vector for malware to enter \u00a0  as well as for intellectual property to leak out of the network. \u00a0  This method remains functional with increased use of encryption and \u00a0  may be more effective at preventing malware from entering the \u00a0  network.\u00a0 Web proxy solutions monitor and potentially restrict access \u00a0  based on the destination URL or the DNS name.\u00a0 A complete URL may be \u00a0  used in cases where access restrictions vary for content on a \u00a0  particular site or for the sites hosted on a particular server. If you are filtering on URL and there is HTTPS involved, then you are a MITM, and this is potentially noticeable to end-users.
