Please can you clarify.\u00a0 Is this every packet in the flow (presumably not)?\u00a0 Does monitored packet means just those with the DEX option?\u00a0 Could it include other packets  2. Optional field ordering. \u00a0  Optional fields The optional fields, if present, reside after the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Reserved field.\u00a0 The order of the optional fields is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  according to the respective bits that are enabled in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  the Extension-Flags field.\u00a0 Each optional field is 4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  octets long. Please can clarify that the order is from most significant bit to least significant bit of the option field. 3. Allocation is based on the \"RFC \u00a0  Required\" procedure, as defined in [ RFC8126 ]. Given the number of extensions is so limited, is RFC required (e.g. allows ISE) really a strict enough allocation policy? Regards, Rob",

        "text": "It isn\u2019t clear whether DEX can be exported outside of the IOAM domain.\u00a0 If it can, more is needed to describe the implications.\u00a0 There are the following related statements: (a) Section 3.1.2 says: \u00a0  Exported packets SHOULD NOT be exported over a path or a tunnel that \u00a0  is subject to IOAM direct exporting. (b) Section 6 says: \u00a0  IOAM is assumed to be deployed in a restricted administrative domain, \u00a0  thus limiting the scope of the threats above and their affect.\u00a0 This \u00a0  is a fundamental assumption with respect to the security aspects of \u00a0  IOAM, as further discussed in [ RFC9197 ]. \u00a0   (c) Section 6 says: \u00a0  Although the exporting method is not within the scope of this \u00a0  document, any exporting method MUST secure the exported data from the \u00a0  IOAM node to the receiving entity.\u00a0 Specifically, an IOAM node that \u00a0  performs DEX exporting MUST send the exported data to a pre- \u00a0  configured trusted receiving entity.\u00a0 Furthermore, an IOAM node MUST \u00a0  gain explicit consent to export data to a receiving entity before \u00a0  starting to send exported data. Statement (b) is the usual caveat that IOAM traffic stays inside the domain.\u00a0 However, this new option type is something different \u2013 there are the packets themselves and the telemetry generated from them (i.e., the export packets).\u00a0 Statement (c) is clear and helpful but doesn\u2019t resolve if these entities are in the IOAM domain.\u00a0 Statement (a) seems to mitigation for not creating loops but like (c) silent on clarifying whether in the IOAM domain. If export can only happen in the IOAM domain, consider adding something as simple as the following in the Security Considerations: NEW: DEX exporting MUST NOT be to entities outside of the IOAM domain.",

        "text": "Thanks for working on this specification.  Thanks to Colin Perkins for his valuable TSVART review. I find the TSVART early reviewer's concern on rate limiting the exported traffic triggered by DEX Option-type as only protection mechanism ( https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsv-art/1WNgYWGJmxLd4f3RAiDk-LJ-S8Y/ ) very valid but haven't seen it addressed. In this discuss, I would like to bring back attention to that concern and would like to discuss why there should not be a circuit breaker kind of functionality required here? I also think this specification should be explicit about not exporting IOAM data to any receiver outside of IOAM limited domain. Hence supporting Roman's discuss. for example - The introduction section can state- OLD text- \u00a0  A \u00a0  \"receiving entity\" in this context can be, for example, an external \u00a0  collector, analyzer, controller, decapsulating node, or a software \u00a0  module in one of the IOAM nodes.
