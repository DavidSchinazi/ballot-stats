And I see that these are the \"Type\" values, but where's the allocation of the \"Extended-Type\" values that are mentioned in those sections? Also, there's another \"TBA\" at the end of Section 14 that points to Section 4.1, but there is no Section 4.1.\u00a0 It looks like maybe that's supposed to be 5.1.",

        "text": "I have no concerns with the technical content of the document; I did a quick review, and nothing causes concern. But I do want to briefly DISCUSS a procedural point. I am quite sure I will clear the DISCUSS on the call. The issue of \"Updates\" worries me a bit. Here's the part that concerned me: \u00a0  Note that if this experiment does not succeed, the \u00a0  \"T\" flag allocation would not persist, as it is tightly associated to \u00a0  this document. That's true, but using Updates will mean that  RFC 6929  will *always* have an \"Updated By\" pointer pointing to this Experimental RFC. That itself could cause serious confusion, and would likely result in the \"T\" allocation never being able to be used again. I really don't think this document needs to, or should, update the other documents. 2865 and 6158 are only being updated because this document violates a MUST and a SHOULD. But it's an experiment. Any implementation of 2865 or 6158 not participating in the experiment is going to need to honor those MUSTs and SHOULDs. There's no real reason to call out this update to people who are only looking at those two documents. 6929 is a bit trickier, because of the issue of other folks trying to use the reserved value, but as you say in the document: \"not such a great number of specifications extending that field are expected.\" If/when this document goes to Standards Track, that's the time to let people know. If there's a real fear of this experiment interfering with other implementations, it really is time to make the registry. Finally, I'm concerned about the precedent of Experimental documents updating Standards Track and BCP docs, especially on the grounds provided. Perhaps there's a case for that to happen once in a while, but we don't want pointers to possibly failed experiments to be in the meta-data forever. Like I said, we can sort this on the call pretty quickly. But I want to make sure we understand the implications here.",
