        "text": "I support Roman's Discuss (and comment) and will expound on his first point some more. The use of URIs to refer to remote content, potentially hosted on a third party, has numerous security considerations, some better known than others.\u00a0 We need to reference the security considerations of  RFC 3986  to get some coverage of these, such as the \"reliability and consistency\" point. One of the more subtle security considerations of using a URI to a remote resource as part of a request in cases such as this, is that the binding between the identity of the entity referring to the remote URI and the identity of the site providing the corresponding resource (i.e., the authority compoent of the URI) is not always clear.\u00a0 Although  RFC 7852  requires TLS mutual authentication and HTTPS transport for information provided by reference, it makes no statement requiring the TLS server certificate to correspond to the SIP initiator, or any other indication of authorization that the indicated resource makes sense as part of the indicated request. I also have two other Discuss-level points: We discuss the use of timestamps in protocol elements for detecting replay; this requires that all participants have (secure and) accurate time.\u00a0 We need to document this dependency on accurate time, and optionally point out that common internet time protocols such as NTP are not particularly secure at present. I'm also not sure where there's existing treatment of using SIP MESSAGEs as a DoS attack vector; that seems particularly pronounced in the emergency-services case since emergency messages may receive preferential treatment from the network.",
