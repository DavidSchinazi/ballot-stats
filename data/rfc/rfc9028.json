        "text": "I share Ben's concerns about the disjointedness of this document's specification, and am likewise abstaining. My reasons for abstaining are deeper than Ben's, however. I recognize that the effort put into this document is substantial, and that the recommendations I make are unlikely to be taken at this point in time, but I believe that the HIP ecosystem would be far better served by an \"RFC 5570 bis\" approach rather than a modified form of ICE recast using HIP messages. Among other reasons: several companies already offer geographically-distributed hosted TURN solutions, largely due to the relative popularity of WebRTC. HIP will have to reach a similar level of popularity before HIP-specific relay nodes are similarly commercially available.\u00a0 Using ICE as-is would allow HIP to use those services that are available today. As a further concern, I worry that this pattern may end up replicated in other protocols. For example, although ICE was initially developed with RTP/RTCP in mind, it was not implemented as a series of extensions to RTP or RTCP; instead, it is its own protocol, intended to be re-used in other contexts. I would not like to see, e.g., ICE-like extensions to the QUIC protocol to enable its use in peer-to-peer situations; I would certainly hope that such an effort would use ICE as currently defined. Given that the headline rationale offered in this document is that \"Implementing a full ICE/STUN/TURN protocol stack as specified in Legacy ICE-HIP results in a considerable amount of effort and code which could be avoided by re-using and extending HIP messages and state machines for the same purpose,\" this document puts forth an implication that all protocols could benefit from similar not-quite-ICE-but-almost-ICE extensions. I believe this implication is harmful. I also believe this analysis overlooks the availability of multiple existing, open-source, already-debugged, and \"compatible with commercial use\" ICE implementations. It is not clear that the four additional reasons offered in Appendix B are sufficient to justify the design. Taken in turn: >\u00a0 For example, ICE is meant for application-layer protocols, whereas HIP >\u00a0 operates at layer 3.5 between transport and network layers. This doesn't have practical effect: ICE is designed to work with generic UDP packet flows, subject only to the ability to demultiplex STUN from such packets. >\u00a0 This is particularly problematic because the implementations employ IPsec >\u00a0 ESP as their data plane: demultiplexing of incoming ESP, HIP and TURN >\u00a0 messages required capturing of all UDP packets destined to port 10500 to >\u00a0 the userspace, thus causing additional software complexity and an >\u00a0 unnecessary latency/throughput bottleneck for the dataplane performance. This doesn't seem like a foregone consequence. If you're using user-space HIP implementations, this user-space diversion is already necessary. If you're using kernel-space HIP implementations, it seems a modest step to add minimal STUN demultiplexing to the kernel implementation that is already performing ESP/HIP demultiplexing.\u00a0 It's possible that I'm misunderstanding some subtle aspect of the way these protocols interact with each other, but isn't this described performance impact simply the result of specific implementation design decisions rather than inherent to the design of  RFC 5570 's mechanism? >\u00a0 Also, relaying of ESP packets via TURN relays was not >\u00a0 considered that simple because TURN relays require adding and >\u00a0 removing extra TURN framing for the relayed packets. While it's been a while since I've looked at network kernel code, my recollection is that implementation of the POSIX \"sendmsg()\" system call generally maintains scatter/gather buffers all the way down the stack until such bytes are copied from system memory to the network hardware. Stripping such headers on receipt can be accomplished with simple pointer arithmetic. It's not clear what aspect of the system \"simple\" is intended to refer to, but both implementation and performance impacts should be immeasurably small when implemented in this way, unless I'm missing something. >\u00a0 Finally, the developers of the two Legacy ICE-HIP implementations concluded >\u00a0 that \"effort needed for integrating an ICE library into a HIP >\u00a0 implementation turned out to be quite a bit higher that initially >\u00a0 estimated.\u00a0 Also, the amount of extra code (some 10 kLoC) needed for all >\u00a0 the new parsers, state machines, etc., is quite high and by re-using the >\u00a0 HIP code one should be able to do with much less.\u00a0 This should result in >\u00a0 smaller binary size, less bugs, and easier debugging.\". Such size is not inherent in the implementation of ICE: for example, the ICE stack used by Firefox is 2.2 kLoC in size (if you ignore the ~1.2 kLoC of boilerplate copyright notice). Having seen the debugging of an ICE stack up-close-and-personal, I'm pretty comfortable saying that the effort to integrate a working stack has to be orders of magnitude less than implementing even the simplified ICE procedures defined in this document correctly. There are a lot of surprising corner cases that don't really turn up until you get into production. For the foregoing reasons, it is my conclusion that publication of this document is harmful for HIP and is harmful as a precedent that other protocols may mistakenly emulate. I believe that a restructuring of the document to more clearly explain why HIP chose this path while other protocols should not would limit some of these concerns. However, I do not believe that the fundamental flaw -- a partial respecification of ICE for the cited reasons --\u00a0 can be fixed. I do not support publication of a document describing this mechanism, and encourage the working group to withdraw the document from consideration for publication. To be clear: despite the length and detail of my preceding objections, I recognize that I may be off in the weeds. I am happy to be corrected about any of the assertions I make above, up to and including corrections that make my conclusion incorrect. I will further note that this is not a blocking ballot position, and that, procedurally, the document can be published despite my misgivings. =========================================================================== I have included some additional comments below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a71: >\u00a0 As one solution, the HIP experiment report [ RFC6538 ] mentions that >\u00a0 Teredo based NAT traversal for HIP and related ESP traffic (with >\u00a0 double tunneling overhead). This isn't a sentence. Perhaps remove \"that\"? Also: \"Teredo-based\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a74.6: >\u00a0 The connectivity checks follow the ICE methodology [MMUSIC-ICE], but >\u00a0 UDP encapsulated HIP control messages are used instead of ICE >\u00a0 messages.\u00a0 Only normal nomination MUST be used for the connectivity >\u00a0 checks, i.e., aggressive nomination MUST NOT be employed. The cited document does not describe aggressive nomination, and deprecates its use. Consider removing the mention of aggressive nomination in this document. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a75.4: >\u00a0 \u00a0 The following NAT traversal mode IDs are defined: > >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ID name\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Value >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 RESERVED\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  0 >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 UDP-ENCAPSULATION\u00a0 \u00a0 1 >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ICE-STUN-UDP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  2 >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ICE-HIP-UDP\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 This should probably point to the IANA table rather than replicating a snapshot of its contents. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appendix B: >\u00a0 o\u00a0 Unlike in ICE, the addresses are not XOR-ed in Native ICE-HIP >\u00a0 \u00a0  protocol in order to avoid middlebox tampering.

The problem is that it cherry-picks pieces of ICE and I'm just not sure that it's a complete specification when put all together. I have noted a number of places where I actually am not sure how to implement something, and fixing those will resolve this DISCUSS, but IMO you really should totally rewrite this document either (a) as a variant of ICE or (b) as an entirely new document not with a pile of new text and then references out to ICE sections.

I think the document needs a discussion and impact on MTU which this NAT traversal has on the HIP packets being sent.  - First of all there appears to be more packet expansions happening in some cases, for example the RELAY_HMAC option expands packets on one leg. - Secondly, HIP requires IP fragementation support, however IP fragmentation through NAT is commonly not working. Thus an HIP packet being UDP encapsulated that results in packet exceeding MTU will likely end up in an MTU black hole on path.  The addition of the NAT traversal encapsulation actually increases the need for MTU discovery or care in MTU handling by the HIP initiator. I think there need to be discussion of that in the document.",
