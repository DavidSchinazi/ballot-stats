        "text": "The following text in section 4 seems to indicate that scheduling is done on a per-packet basis: \"When there is a \u00a0  datagram to be sent to a destination, the source router acquires a \u00a0  path from the Multi-path Routing Set (MAY be Round-Robin, or other \u00a0  scheduling algorithms).\" This seems not appropriate as e.g. TCP packets routed on links with largely different delays may suffer performance. ECMP usually hashes the 5-tuple or 6-tuple (incl. DiffServ Codepoint) to setup state and routes all packets belonging to the same flow on the same route. I recommend to apply the same here. Also related is this text in section 8.4 that should explain Round-Robin on a per flow basis instead. Further this should only be an example scheduling alogirthm while text belong seems to assume that Round-Robin is always used. \"If a matching Multi-path Routing Tuple is obtained, the Path Tuples \u00a0  of the Multi-path Routing Tuple are applied to the datagrams using \u00a0  Round-robin scheduling.\u00a0 For example, there are 2 path Tuples \u00a0  (Path-1, Path-2) for destination router D. A series of datagrams \u00a0  (Packet-1, Packet-2, Packet-3, ... etc.) are to be sent router D. \u00a0  Path-1 is then chosen for Packet-1, Path-2 for Packet-2, Path-1 for \u00a0  Packet 3, etc.\u00a0 Other path scheduling mechanisms are also possible \u00a0  and will not impact the interoperability of different \u00a0  implementations.\" Related is this text in section 8.4.: \"If datagrams without source routing header need to be forwarded using \u00a0  multiple paths (for example, based on the information of DiffServ \u00a0  Code Point [ RFC2474 ])\" RFC2474  does not specify any application requirements on multipath use and as such the DiffServe field should not be used to determine if the flow can be routed on multiple paths. The ability to profit from multipath routing depends not only on the application and protocols used but also on the characteristics of the multipath link(s); so it's hard to make any implicit assumptions here. However, if routing would only be recommended on a per-flow basis this problem does not occur and the brackets above could be remove. Further, if routed on a per flow basis would be done, DiffServ could actually be used to decide which path to use, if e.g. one path has a lower delay, but that seem to need further discussion as well.",
