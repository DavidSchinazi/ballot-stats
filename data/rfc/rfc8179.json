(1) section 1: \"For example, the presentations made by invited speakers at IETF plenary sessions to discuss advances in Internet technology generally, or to describe their existing products or technologies, are not Contributions.\" For saag presentations, (that are also sometimes invited), we (sec ADs) have tended to consider those as contributions, in the sense that we've asked presenters to be specific about IPR and to make IPR declarations if needed. I think the example in the document is a bad one, don't recall it being discussed (though it may have been on the IPR list) and would prefer we not try to make a distinction between some technical presentations and other technical presentations at IETF meetings.\u00a0 I'd say deleting the sentence is a good enough change. If not, then I'd like to understand how this affects invited presentations in area meetings and other meetings (e.g. RGs) and what is expected of folks chairing such or inviting the invitees. (2) 5.5: We've had two recent cases of WGs that were DoS'd by a declaration that said \"will add license terms later\" but where the declaration was never updated and the IPR holder went radio-silent. It was the same IPR holder in both cases. The entity in question has employees who participate frequently and have for an extended period (so this is not a \"new\" entity by any means). I would like if we could say that that's bad form, but can we? If so, how? And would we need to re-do LC for such an addition?",
