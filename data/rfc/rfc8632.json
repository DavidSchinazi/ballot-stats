The system design appears to rest on that principle that there will allways be sufficient resources to process and handle the events and that misconfigurations or operator errors do not result in that the system exceeeds the considered load that it was deployed to handle. This alarm module is only a component that from my perspective do require some thought of how alarms that has interactions are reported and with which priority to minimize delay until they can be acted on. However, the general framework appears to lack the necessary hook for such thoughts to be meaningful. Therefore I abstain on this document.",
