        "text": "Hi There, Thanks for the document. I am issuing a discuss based on section 6.3 of the document that I'd like to talk about.\u00a0  RFC8200  Section 4.1 states:  Each extension header should occur at most once, except for the \u00a0  Destination Options header, which should occur at most twice (once \u00a0  before a Routing header and once before the upper-layer header). I also note that  RFC8200  is not written using normative language - but considering the context I am assuming that this should be read as such. This directly conflicts with section 6.3 - which makes allowance for multiple SRH in the packet.\u00a0 The only way that multiple SRH's should be allowed to occur in the packet is if the packet is re-encapsulated - at which point section 6.3 would still (in my view) not be referring to multiple SRH's - since the second SRH would be attached to a fully encapsulated packet. If there is indeed a need for multiple SRH in IPFIX - this would require a pretty clear explanation as to why, how this could occur and a strong justification for violating  RFC8200  in my opinion.",
