        "text": "I am quite uncomfortable with this document going to Internet Standard and not recycling at Proposed Standard. This document makes several significant non-backwards-compatible changes, which is not appropriate for a document advancing in grade. My ballot would be significantly different if this were going for PS. (Indeed, some of these DISCUSS points might go away, but some of the COMMENTs might become DISCUSS points because they are things that are in 5451.) For purposes of advancing to IS: 1.3: The new information in 1.3 seems incorrect. Certainly an MUA always looks at an already-delivered email message. The old 1.3 made it clear that this wasn't intended for an embedded message/rfc822 construct, but I always took that to be because it was outside of the trust boundary between the MDA and the MUA. But for messages that are delivered to a mail spool that an MUA reads and displays to the user, it is perfectly appropriate to look in the top-level of that message for the Authentication-Results. That does depend on the MDA and MUA being on the same side of the trust boundary, but other than that there is not a problem. Please explain this change. (Note: If this document were recycling at Proposed, this would be a comment, but moving to full Internet Standard, I want to understand the change before moving ahead.) 2.2: - You are expanding authserv-id to allow quoted-string and disallowing \"?\", \"=\", and \"/\" outside of quotes. This seems like a big change from 5451. - You are limiting method, result, and property to having nothing but LDH in them. Those are significant changes from 5451. - In the comment to pvalue: I think having 2119 MUST language in a comment to ABNF is crazy (being in 5451 notwithstanding). This requirement should be pulled out into the main text below the ABNF. 2.5.2: You've reversed the sense of the registry by incorporating from the SPF spec. The definition of the registry entries for the codes coming from SPF would now have to point to SPF, not for the meaning, but for the actual names. That would mean that the registry should now be an authentication method registry with the subregistry (or subentries in the table) being the result codes. Very confusing. 4: \u00a0  The set of message properties registered for a given method, upon \u00a0  which the reported result is based, can be numerous.\u00a0 However, the \u00a0  ones included in the header field being generated SHOULD NOT include \u00a0  any that were not included in the computation of the result.\u00a0 Doing \u00a0  so can confound consumers of the field when the method includes \u00a0  multiple evaluation methods.\u00a0 For example, SPF can base its \u00a0  conclusion on the  RFC5321 .Helo parameter or on the  RFC5321 .MailFrom \u00a0  domain; including both of those in the Authentication-Results header \u00a0  field makes it impossible for the consumer to determine which \u00a0  property of the message envelope was actually used. I don't get this paragraph. Are you saying that if SPF used HELO, I SHOULD NOT indicate that I used MAIL FROM? That seems like the height of absurdity to say. If this is something that needs to be called out, I don't understand why it isn't a MUST NOT. What does this mean?",
