In particular, from  RFC 5880  Section 6.8.6, the paragraph: %\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the Poll (P) bit is set, send a BFD Control packet to the %\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 remote system with the Poll (P) bit clear, and the Final (F) bit %\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 set (see section 6.8.7). Does not appear to have any corresponding text in this document. From  RFC 5880  Section 6.8.7, the first four paragraphs (too long for me to include here) do not appear to have their substance covered in this document, either (largely discussion about the pacing of BFD Control packets and jitter in their scheduling). Section 5.13.3's text now only covers how to set Min Echo Rx Interval for MultipointHead and MultiplintTail sessions, which seems to remove guidance on how to set it for other session types. While it is permissible for a document that Updates another document to perform this sort of deprecation of behavior, it is potentially confusing for implementors to do so without mentioning the change in behavior. Separately, I wonder if it is appropriate to Update  RFC 7880  as well as 5880, given (e.g.) Section 5.4.1. I also think that Section 6 should describe more clearly how asymmetric message authentication relates to this work (i.e., whether it is entirely incompatible with BFD or does it merely require additional specification).",
