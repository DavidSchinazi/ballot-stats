Section 3 says: \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions ] defines the H-PCE Capability TLV \u00a0  that is used in the Open message to advertise the H-PCE capability. \u00a0  [ RFC8231 ] defines the Stateful PCE Capability TLV used in the Open \u00a0  message to indicate stateful support.\u00a0 The presence of both TLVs in \u00a0  an Open message indicates the support for stateful H-PCE operations \u00a0  as described in this document. There is no normative reference relationship (in either direction) between draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy-extension and this document; I think that the use of the capability TLV to imply both sets of functionality implies some sort of normative relationship; we wouldn't want version skew between documents to induce breaking changes.\u00a0 In particular, an implementation that already supports  RFC 8231  and is implementing the hierarchy extensions would need to know to look at this document *and implement it*, or would unknowingly be noncompliant with this document and fail to interoperate with a peer that is compliant with this document.",
