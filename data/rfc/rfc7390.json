The text in section 1.2 implies that the primary multicast mode of operation is source-specific, but doesn't explicitly state that.\u00a0 Is it intended that multicast is only done in an SSM mode?\u00a0 If so, it would be good to provide explicit discussion of that (including references to relevant SSM RFCs such as 3569, 4604, and 4607).\u00a0 If the goal is to also support ASM, that should be stated explicitly. 2. Does the multicast proxy forwarding described in  RFC 4605  apply in section 2.1? 3. I am a little concerned with the SHOULD used in section 2.2 when discussing nodes joining the All-CoAP-Nodes multicast address.\u00a0 What happens if a device does not join that group?\u00a0 Will the protocol break? 4. Section 2.3 should allow a device to obtain the port number for the group from the URI schema referenced in section 2.2. 5. I see that the socket() API ( RFC 3542 ) is referenced, but it is not discussed in terms of CoAP interacting with the group management protocols.\u00a0 Is it assumed that implementers know that they are to use that API to indicate changes in group membership state to IGMP/MLD?",

Is this solely repeating what's anyway specified by CORE or is it giving different advice? Or is it trying to override the CORE spec? What is happening if there are inconsistent guidances?

The draft updates protocol behavior of  RFC 7252  in at least two Sections: 2.5 and also 2.7. But is never saying so and legally speaking also not requesting any update of  RFC 7252 .  Section 2.5 updates the handling of tokens for the mutlicast usage.  Section 2.7 adds a completely new functionality to the protocol. This has also been nicely pointed out by the GENART reviewer:  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/core/current/msg05535.html Probably the document is heading for standards track instead of informational? Further, I do see multiple playes where the  RFC 2119  language is inappropriate: 2.2.\u00a0 Group Definition and Naming [...] \u00a0  All CoAP server nodes SHOULD join the \"All CoAP Nodes\" multicast \u00a0  group [ RFC7252 ], Section 12.8) by default to enable CoAP discovery. \u00a0  For IPv4, the address is 224.0.1.187 and for IPv6 a server node joins \u00a0  at least both the link-local scoped address FF02::FD and the site- \u00a0  local scoped address FF05::FD.\u00a0 IPv6 addresses of other scopes MAY be \u00a0  enabled. Since this is (hopefully) just repeating what  RFC 7252  say, it is just good to say:  \"All CoAP server nodes should/are supposed to join the \"All CoAP Nodes\" multicast\" Also the \"MAY be\" is a \"can be\" in reality.  2.7.2.\u00a0 Membership Configuration RESTful Interface The \" an OPTIONAL CoAP membership configuration RESTful\" is misplaced, as this in informational draft, but this goes back to my general DISCUSS point above.  Further: \u00a0  To access this interface a client MUST use \u00a0  unicast CoAP methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE).\u00a0 This interface is a This MUST is not correct here. A sentence saying that only the unicast methods are useful in this respect is sufficient. And here the contradiction is happening, as I do not see a MUST for DTLS in  RFC 7252  and this text below is also not adding anything useful to the discussions what is needed to achieve interoperability, i.e., inappropriate for MUST in this place: \u00a0  Also, a form of authorization (making use of DTLS-secured CoAP \u00a0  [ RFC7252 ]) MUST be used such that only authorized controllers are \u00a0  allowed by an endpoint to configure its group membership.",
