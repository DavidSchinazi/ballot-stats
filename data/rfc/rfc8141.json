The draft also seems to spend more time saying what it does not specify rather than what it does. My not-that-well-informed guess is that this product of stalwart effort does not improve the Internet, despite the earnest extended multi-year efforts of the few folks involved. I'd further bet that the world in general would be fine if this did not become and RFC.\u00a0 Normally, I'd just ballot no-objection and let that go, but given that this has consumed cycles for 6 years that could perhaps have been more usefully engaged in dealing with 3986 issues, I think abstaining is a better position to take on the off-chance that that sends some tiny form of signal. (Apologies to those who engaged in this work, I don't mean any disrespect, but I don't think the result here is really worth the effort expended.) - What deployed code supports the ?+ or ?= constructs?\u00a0 If some arguably \"important\" code does, I'd change my abstain to a no-objection, as then there'd be an at least modest new feature to justify the new RFC. - Section 8 should I think recognise the dangers inherent in long-term stable identifiers helping with (re-)identification of people and/or network entities. While that is not the \"fault\" of URNs, I'd say it is worth warning folks who may just possibly think twice before creating new URNs with those failings.
