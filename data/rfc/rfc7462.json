I can understand the desire to provide some warning to organizations to say \"don't squat on someone else's\u00a0 name,\" but ultimately if a registry is not being defined, there is nothing the IETF can do to require organizations to follow that guidance. If it's that important, then the proper way to handle this would be with a registry. I think it would be reasonable to retain the suggestion that, at the time when a\u00a0 is being defined, it should be defined by the registered owner of the corresponding\u00a0 (second para of 10.3), but drop the rest (third para of 10.3). When domain name ownership gets transferred, the transferor and the transferee will have to work out who maintains the definition of the 's URNs. (As an aside, the date stuff seems superfluous as well. I have a hard time believing it will get used, but I'm assuming there is some reason for it to be there in the first place? I see that there is some precedent for the provider+date structure in  RFC 4198 . Section 16: Even with authorization, the caller or callee may want to protect the confidentiality of these alerts (along with other headers). I agree with the SECDIR reviewer's suggestion about mentioning the use of TLS here, with appropriate caveats about difficulty of deployment.",

We have too many cases when we've later regretted using Standards Action or IETF Review (the registration of a URN NID being one of them; we're in the pocess of changing that policy in the urnbis working group).\u00a0 And especially if you want other standards outside the IETF to use these, requiring them to get an IETF Standards Track RFC or to use private names doesn't seem reasonable.
