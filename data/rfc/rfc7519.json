Another way is to ensure that JWTs containing unencrypted privacy-sensitive information are only transmitted over encrypted channels or protocols that also support endpoint authentication, such as TLS.",

And, yet, Sections 5.1 and 5.2 specify that the values of typ and cty are case-insensitive, and specify using upper case as a SHOULD, for \"compatibility with legacy implementations\". It doesn't seem that \"legacy\" has anything to do with this: someone conforming to *this* specification will compare the values of typ and cty Unicode-character by Unicode-character, and will fail to match \"JWT\" with \"jwt\". Is there not a problem here? -- Section 10.3.1 -- Nice that you cite 2046 for media types, but the *registration* of media types is documented in  RFC 6838 , and this document doesn't quite conform to that.\u00a0 The only thing missing in the doc is \"Fragment identifier considerations\" in the registration template, but 6838 also strongly suggests review of the media-type registration on the media-types mailing list.\u00a0 Given that this will not get expert review (because it's an IETF-stream RFC), I'd like to ask for an explicit review on the media-types list to make sure that the registration information is complete and makes sense.",
