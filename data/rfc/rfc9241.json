Many thanks to Thomas Fossati for his in-depth review:  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/art/MKG2Cdin96WLcksnA6nAu6pvThM/  , and thanks to the authors for addressing it. I have two comments that need to be addressed before publication. As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion; I really think that the document would be improved with a change here, but can be convinced otherwise.

Before progressing the document, I would really appreciate the authors to post the registrations to the media-type mailing list for review. Note that people there might also weigh in to the point Thomas made about the media type name, and if it's worth specifying a more detailed media type name, or not in this case.",

Only 2 small changes noted by Alexey are still missing - quoting the relevant text in his mail  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/media-types/LU4gHAY4fQZ6vK7rh8pdSfDwTO0/: 1. >>\u00a0 \u00a0  Also when you split the registration template into 2 it would be \u00a0  >>\u00a0 \u00a0  good to have a sentence here explaining how the two formats differ. > > > Thanks for the suggestion. Could you kindly give us some further  > examples about what should be explained? Do we need to explain the  > different cases where the two subtypes should be used, or just explain  > the difference between the two registration forms? The former. If I as an implementor read the registration, I need to  decide whether or not I should implement processing of this particular  media type. 2. I've just realized that you are also missing \"Fragment identifier  considerations:\" field after this one. (See  RFC 6838 ) Having it as \"N/A\"  is fine. Francesca",
