I will be balloting YES on this document, but I have a point that needs to be worked out.\u00a0 For the time being, this should be treated as a process issue and there is currently no need for document changes from the authors... Section 6.3 of this document, and  RFC 4601 , currently says \"The IPsec [8] transport mode using the Authentication Header (AH) is the recommended method to prevent the above attacks against PIM.\" However,  RFC 5796 , which updates  RFC 4601 , says \"In order to provide authentication of PIM-SM link-local messages, implementations MUST support ESP [ RFC4303 ] and MAY support AH [ RFC4302 ].\" The two issues that I think we need to resolve are: 1. Will 4601bis, when it is published as an RFC, inherit the \"Updated by:  RFC 5796 \" meta-data so that implementers will know to use the newer guidance provided in 5796?\u00a0 There is a query to the RFC Editor on this point. 2. Should the text in section 6.3 be updated to adopt the recommendation from 5796 rather than maintain the obsolete recommendation for the use of AH?\u00a0 If so,  RFC 5796  could be referenced, which would lead to adding 5796 to the downref registry.",

The ickky process questions are probably best discussed between the IESG at least initially in case we don't need to bother the authors/wg with 'em. (1) I'd like to check that 5796 defines a way in which one can secure all PIM messages that are defined here in 4601bis (should one want to do that). If there are cases where PIM-SM can be used and where there is no well defined security then I think that would be a problem. And I think maybe there are such cases. Am I wrong? If not, then how does one secure those? (2) Is it ok for an IS to depend on a PS for it's MTI security mechanism? (I think it is, but yeah, someone else might not.)  (3) Is it ok for an IS to not conform to  BCP107 ?
