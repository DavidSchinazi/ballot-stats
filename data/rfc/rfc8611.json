This document has six listed authors; per  RFC 7322 , documents listing more than five authors are unusual, and six is greater than five.\u00a0 Let's talk about the author count. \"optional TLV\" seems to be used in MPLS contexts as a technical term for \"comprehension-optional\", not in the \"optional to send\" sense; it's the counterpart of \"mandatory TLV\", and this terminology is even documented in the MPLS TLVs registry.\u00a0 It's my understanding that the LSP Capabilities TLV and the Detailed Interface and Label Stack TLV are intended to be comprehension-required (i.e., \"mandatory TLVs\"), and thus that we must not use the phrase \"optional TLV\" in their description. This would be made clear if we listed which range of values we intended to allocate a TLV type from, in the IANA considerations, but that remains unspecified at this time. In a similar vein (the \"comprehension-required\" behavior), there are a few places (Section 3 (twice), and Section 6; also Section 3 for the LAG Description Indicator flag; see COMMENT) where we state new normative language (\"MUST\") that is unenforceable, since it would need to apply to MPLS implementations that do not implement this specification. Fortunately, the comprehension-required TLV ranges provide this functionality for us without the need to use normative language. Section 4.2 has some conflicting \"MUST\"s about the ordering/presence of sub-TLVs in the DDMAP TLV (see COMMENT, and also the \"MANDATORY\" langauge in Figure 2). If I'm reading Section 5.1.2 correctly, the described procedure is only intended to apply when the \"G\" flag is present (as well as the \"I\" flag, the requirement for which is explicitly stated), but this is not explicitly stated.\u00a0 In particular, the text as written says it applies to all responders that \"understand the LAG Description Indicator flag\" with no mention of runtime check for the presence of that flag. I also worry that Sections 8, 9, and 10 are insufficiently clear about the encoding of the interface index value -- is it an integer in NBO, an opaque bitstring, or something else?",
