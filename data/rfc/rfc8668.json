I think I caught the added considerations, but please expand on it if I've missed something. The draft seems to enable methods to gather information on connected links and the available bandwidth. That should be mentioned as a vulnerability, exposing path information (connections/links and bandwidth).\u00a0 This is a consideration in other IS-IS RFCs and is specific to the TLVS and subTLVs of this draft as well as far as I can tell, but please correct me if I am missing something.  The use of the Sub-TLV identifiers provide path information that should be a security consideration in the write up: \u00a0  o\u00a0 IPv4 Interface Address (sub-TLV 6 defined in [ RFC5305 ]) \u00a0  o\u00a0 IPv6 Interface Address (sub-TLV 12 defined in [ RFC6119 ]) \u00a0  o\u00a0 Link Local/Remote Identifiers (sub-TLV 4 defined in [ RFC5307 ]) Within a single operator environment, the concerns are mitigated, but not eliminated since it does not appear that encryption is used. The following text from  RFC7917  seems like a useful addition to these security considerations along with an explanation of what is possibly exposed with this draft (above): \u00a0  Security concerns for IS-IS are already addressed in [ISO10589], \u00a0  [ RFC5304 ], and [ RFC5310 ] and are applicable to the mechanisms \u00a0  described in this document.\u00a0 Extended authentication mechanisms \u00a0  described in [ RFC5304 ] or [ RFC5310 ] SHOULD be used in deployments \u00a0  where attackers have access to the physical networks, because nodes \u00a0  included in the IS-IS domain are vulnerable.",
