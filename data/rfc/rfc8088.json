In section 3.2.1.\u00a0 IETF Process and Publication, \u00a0  It is very important to note and understand the IETF Intellectual \u00a0  Property Rights (IPR) policy that requires early disclosures based on \u00a0  personal knowledge from anyone contributing in IETF.\u00a0 The IETF \u00a0  policies associated with IPR are documented in  BCP 78  [ RFC5378 ] \u00a0  (related to copyright, including software copyright for example code) \u00a0  and  BCP 79  [ RFC3979 ] (related to patent rights). BCP 78  is a single-RFC BCP, so that's correct now, but the base RFC could be reissued or updated in other RFCs included in the BCP, and  BCP 79  is a multi-RFC BCP, so citing it as [ RFC3979 ] isn't quite right. A bit further in the same section, in \u00a0  The main part of the IETF process is formally defined in  RFC 2026 \u00a0  [ RFC2026 ].\u00a0  RFC 2418  [ RFC2418 ] describes the WG process, the relation \u00a0  between the IESG and the WG, and the responsibilities of WG chairs \u00a0  and participants. both  RFC 2026  and  RFC 2418  are part of multi-RFC BCPs ( BCP 9  and  BCP 25 , respectively).
