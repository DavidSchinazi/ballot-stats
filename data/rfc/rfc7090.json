I find the Security Considerations unrealistic.\u00a0 Here: you have defined a header field value that anyone can use to try to get expedited handling.\u00a0 In Section 5.2 you say that you must treat failures to accept this value as though they were normal calls.\u00a0 And so: why shouldn't every telemarketer on Earth immediately start setting this in every one of their calls?\u00a0 At *worst*, their calls will be treated the same as if they hadn't.\u00a0 And at best, they'll get through with expedited treatment, as though they were emergency callbacks.\u00a0 What's stopping them from rampantly abusing this?",

If this is meant as an interim solution until stir is available, then that should be stated.\u00a0 And that raises another question - if stir were available then I don't think you'd even need this indication, but maybe some people would want both and then would ask for the stir signture to cover this as well, which could complicate (and maybe damage) stir. So having this as an interim solution might have a downside. And if this is not an interim solution, then I don't get why it doesn't e.g. have its own (realistically usable, i.e.\u00a0 not 4744) signature scheme.\u00a0 All that leaves me wondering: why not just wait for stir and use that? (2) - The reference to 4744 is misleading since nobody does that. Does anyone do 3325? In any case, the text there should reflect reality.",
