I'm also concerned about the policy/procedure for allocating/extending the various bitfields and similar potential extension points in the data structures.\u00a0 Section 8 covers the major/minor versioning semantics with respect to new map keys and new maps, but not addition of new bits within existing (uint) bitmaps.\u00a0 Given the usage of the CDDL .bits constraint, it's not really clear that an IANA registry is the right tool to use, but I think some indication of the expected way to allocate new bits is in order, whether it's \"a future standards-track document that updates this document\" or otherwise.\u00a0 (I've noted many, but not all, instances of such bitmaps in my COMMENT section.) There are also a couple of fields whose semantics don't seem to be sufficiently well specified for a proposed-standard document, such as vlan-ids, generator-id, name-rdata, and ae-code.\u00a0 (I understand that some of them are probably only going to have locally relevant semantics, but we should be explicit about when that's the case.) If I'm reading things correctly that the IP address type is inferred from the bytestring length, then I think we need to enforce a restriction on the address prefix length(s) to allow for that inference to be unambiguous (noting that we only have the *byte* length of the address fields at our disposal for disabmgituation, and not the more precise bit-length).",
