After having reviewed Appendix A I think the WG has made the wrong choice and also not considered all the available choices for enabling DOTS signal and call home to be colocated on the same port. Several options exists: \t- URI name space so that it is the same protocol just making requests with different URIs depending on mode \t- Use the already existing settings negotiation to determine the mode of operation. \t- Using ALPN on (D)TLS connection establishment From my perspective the DOTS WG have multiple choices that are quite simple to solve there colocation issue that would not incur significnat cost or overhead. Using an additional port do incur a cost of consuming a resource that is endless and not easily recoverable. I do share the IANA port experts team's verdict that this port assignment should be denied and alternative solution found as the motivation appears very weak.",

        "text": "It seems to me there is a missing operational guidance or undocumented deployment assumptions.\u00a0 Since the motivational use case seems to be home networks (per Section 1.1), I assumed that the call home servers are running primarily consumer grade routers not managed by professional IT expertise.\u00a0 If that assumption is true (and it should be documented if that is the case), then I find many of the operational recommendations not congruent with that environment.\u00a0 Specifically, the degree of interaction and tuning seems outside the realm of expertise of someone without IT training and capabilities of home network ecosystem.\u00a0 In particular: -- Section 1.2  The Call Home DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic information to \u00a0  identify the compromised device in its domain that is responsible for \u00a0  launching the DDoS attack, optionally notifies a network \u00a0  administrator, and takes appropriate mitigation action(s).  How would such notification work? -- Section 1.2 and 5.1.\u00a0 Leaves credentials configuration as out of scope.\u00a0 Section 1.2 references [ I-D.ietf-dots-server-discovery ] for provisioning.\u00a0 In turn, Section 1 of [I-D.ietf.server-discovery] also declares this problem out of scope by saying \u201cThis document assumes that security credentials to authenticate DOTS server(s) are pre-provisioned to a DOTS client using a mechanism such as (but not limited to) those discussed in [ RFC8572 ] or [ I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra ]\u201d.\u00a0 However,  RFC8572  seems to rely on NETCONF and RESTCONF which seems like a rather uncommon feature of home routers.\u00a0 BRKSI relies on a manufacturer supplied/contracted infrastructure and keystores that also seem uncommon for consumer grade equipment.  -- Section 5.3.1. The Call Home DOTS server domain administrator consent MAY be \u00a0  required to block the traffic from the compromised device to the \u00a0  attack target.\u00a0 An implementation MAY have a configuration knob to \u00a0  block the traffic from the compromised device to the attack target \u00a0  with or without DOTS server domain administrator consent. The suggestion here seems to be that consumers are acquiring devices that can be remotely reconfigured with out a defined trust model?\u00a0 Some policy or operational context seems appropriate here. -- Section 5.3.1 ... notifies the CPE \u00a0  administrator about the compromised device Notify how? -- Section 8.  Appropriate \u00a0  filters (e.g., access control lists) can be installed on the Call \u00a0  Home DOTS server and network between the Call Home DOTS agents so \u00a0  that only communications from a trusted Call Home DOTS client to the \u00a0  Call Home DOTS server are allowed. This seems like a level of sophistication beyond your average home router user and a place where implementations should consider a secure defaults. -- Section 8. Call Home DOTS servers can also seek the consent of DOTS \u00a0  server domain administrator to block the traffic from the potentially \u00a0  compromised device to the target (see Section 5.3.1). What would be the means to gain such consent? -- Section 9. Note that a Call Home DOTS server can seek an administrator's \u00a0  consent, validate the request by inspecting the relevant traffic for \u00a0  attack signatures, or proceed with both courses of action. As above. -- Section 9. \u00a0 \u00a0 The DOTS Call Home is only advisory in nature.\u00a0 Concretely, the DOTS \u00a0  Call Home does not impose any action to be enforced within the \u00a0  network hosting an attack source; it is up to the Call Home DOTS \u00a0  server (and/or network administrator) to decide whether and which \u00a0  actions are required. Such a decisions seems out beyond the ability of your average home router user. -- Section 8\u00a0 \u201c... explicit policy (e.g., the Call Home DOTS client and server are managed by the same administrative entity), Is there an underlying assumption that the ISP is managing the device?",
