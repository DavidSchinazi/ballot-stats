        "text": "Hi, thank you for your work. I have two points I'd like to discuss with you: 1/ You write: \u00a0  If the value of the OptionLength field is not equal to 4, the BFD \u00a0  Discriminator PIM Hello option is considered malformed, and the \u00a0  receiver MUST stop processing PIM Hello options. Do you mean ignore all other options that would be in the PIM Hello message? I rapidly skimmed through 7761 and could not find such requirement nor an indication that documents defining new Hello options would have to define how to treat options when at least one is malformed. It may be that I simply failed to find the relevant text in PIM specs but I'd nevertheless appreciate if you could elaborate a bit on this. 2/ Twice you write that a PIM-SM router MAY/can become a head. First time in 2nd paragraph of 2.1, and the second time in 2.2. \"become\" gives a sense of automation, meaning without human intervention, and this is apparently confirmed by section 2.2 where becoming a head is driven by the node becoming a GDR. The issue I have is that 8562 is pretty explicit about the fact that the transition to Up state for a head is administratively controlled. You take great care in reusing that word (The head router administratively sets the bfd.SessionState to Up in the MultipointHead session) but I'm not sure this is sufficient to make this an administratively driven action. Maybe it's simply a discussion about the meaning of \"administratively\", but according to the understanding I have of this word (which is influenced by the typical use of it in router implementations), it seems to me that this document departs from 8562. Thank you",
