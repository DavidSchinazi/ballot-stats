It seems like LEDBAT is not what the receiver would want the sender to use for live-streamed content, because if a bottleneck is encountered on the path, the live stream will yield early, and the recipient's perception of quality will degrade. If the bottleneck is near the recipient, then every sender sending chunks will yield early, and there may be no senders available to stream at an acceptable level of quality. I'm assuming the WG discussed this -- it would be helpful to understand why a more aggressive congestion control was not selected for live streaming.",

I actually do understand what is meant, but how could a program evaluate that in order to decicde whether or not to send a PES_RESv4? You then refer to a \"potentially hostile environment\" which could presumably be anywhere, so are you really saying that PES_REScert is the \"right thing\" to do, but you know it won't be done so these are weasel words around that awkward fact? (Apologies if I'm wrong on that, but that's the impression I got when reading this, but maybe that's just my paranoia:-) (2) 6.1.2.2: What exactly are the \"munro\" bytes that are the first input to the signature? Where are those defined? (Sorry if I missed/skipped over that;-) (3) 7.6 and 13.5: SHA1 as the MTI is wrong. Why is that ok, given the collision resistance is less that designed for? 7.7 also calls for SHA256 being implemented in any case. The run-time argument in 13.5 does not convince me.\u00a0 Attacks only ever get worse, so the collision resistance property which this protocol needs ought lead to selection of an as-far-as-known good hash function. Today that means SHA256 and not SHA1.\u00a0  (4) 7.7: Why RSASHA1 and not RSA with SHA256? (5) 7.10: The message number is wrong in the figure. (6) 8.4: I don't see the swarm's metadata record in the ascii art diagram and you just say \"look at section 7\" so two questions: a) where is the \"chunk size used\" option in section 7? and b) do all the swarm metadata options have to be sent each time with no limit on ordering except as given in section 7 (which had one such order sensitive limit I think)? (7) 8.13: Don't you need to register the ppsp URI scheme? In case its useful, which I doubt, if you have code:  RFC6920  URIs could be used for this if you wanted and would save you adding ppsp to the IANA URI scheme registry (and having to deal with the URI police:-)  (8) 13.4: Wouldn't DTLS change the chunk size considerations and also influence how messages map to datagrams? Isn't more specification needed to say how to really use DTLS here? Just saying \"use DTLS or IPsec or higher layer crypto\" doesn't really seem sufficient. And doing the DTLS bits right shouldn't be very hard either.",
