I could imagine that being reasonable when DTLS1.2 was newish, say when this work was getting started 2 years ago, but now a couple of years have passed, it might well be just fine to require DTLS1.2 - a lot has happened since and TLS1.2 deployment is now far ahead of where it was in 2012, and most specs have tended to include text like this because some implementers only had the older TLS version. So the DISCUSS is - is the 9 year old RFC still needed as MTI - can we not just say to use 1.2 now?\u00a0 (Note: since this is sort-of a WebRTC spec, I think it's worth quickly re-visiting this question now to be sure we're taking the right approach, as the answer we pick here is quite likely to be followed by other WebRTC docs over the next year or so. I think this is the first relevant WebRTC protocol spec with this bit of text isn't it?\u00a0 Apologies to the authors of this one for landing the discuss on them:-)",
