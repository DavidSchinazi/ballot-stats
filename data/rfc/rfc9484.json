        "text": "Thank you for the work put into this document. I *really* find the idea and the protocol interesting and useful. The text is also easy to read and to understand (albeit underspecified in some cases -- hence my DISCUSS). Please find below some blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address by adding some text), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Chris Wood for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus *but* it lacks the justification of the intended status.  Other thanks to Tim Winters, the Internet directorate reviewer (at my request): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-masque-connect-ip-09-intdir-telechat-winters-2023-04-07/  (and I have read the email exchange, thanks to all) I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric # DISCUSS (blocking) As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Section 8 Several parts of this section are unspecified, see below. `Note that ICMP messages can originate from a source address different from that of the IP proxying peer.` is of course obvious, but I think that this case (ICMP originating from the global Internet to the proxy client) deserves a section on its own. Notably whether this source must be within the target ? The source address to be used by the proxy when originating an ICMP should also be specified, even if just a reference to  RFC 6724  for IPv6. ## Section 9.2 In the example where the IP proxy has an IP address in the same prefix as the legacy client (there is no on-link / off-link state for IPv4 as opposed to IPv6), the encapsulation behavior of section 7 requires the TTL to be decremented before entering the tunnel, which is really wrong as it this case it is not formally a routing to a different prefix and some protocols may expect TTL=255, which won't be the case. Request to add some text about this \"issue\".",
