        "text": "Thanks for the work everyone has done on this document. I have a concern about an ambiguity that can potentially lead to interop issues between clients and servers that make different assumptions around \\Important mailbox ordinality. The second example in section 3.2.2 and the use of the singular form \"mailbox\" in this passage from section 5 imply that only one mailbox is allowed to be tagged \"\\Important\": >\u00a0 As noted in  RFC 6154 , it is wise to protect the IMAP channel from >\u00a0 passive eavesdropping, and to defend against unauthorized discernment >\u00a0 of the identity of a user's \"\\Important\" mailbox... However, I find no normative text that indicates whether this is expected to be inherent to the mechanism, or whether servers can exercise discretion about allowing more than one mailbox to be tagged \\Important. In particular, I want to ensure that no one develops a client that assumes that the server will prevent it from having multiple such mailboxes (relying on an error in the case that it tries to create a second one), and then chokes when it happens. Similar issues can arise with a permissive server and two clients with different notions about whether multiple \\Important mailboxes are allowed. Please add normative language that either explicitly disallows this behavior, or explicitly allows this behavior.",
