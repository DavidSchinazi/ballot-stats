(1) I'm not sure I'm following the use-cases for this but clearly this protocol could be used as part of a pervasive monitoring toolkit, to track users or client-devices with very fine granularity.\u00a0 So a) can you explain the main valid use-case(s) and b) did you consider  RFC7258  in developing this protocol?\u00a0 The answers here might well result in a few changes to my other discuss points below. I also had a quick peek at 5460, but note that pre-dates 7258 by quite a bit and I'm also not clear how or if this protocol has the same goal of restoring routes.\u00a0 Note also that I am not claiming that there are no good uses for this protocol, I'm just asking what (some of) those are and how you considered the PM issue.\u00a0  (2) I also think you need to add (or reference) privacy considerations text here - the information accessible via this could have significant privacy impact.  (3) Along the lines of (1) - can you say why all of the various bits of data one could return are needed by the requestor here? If not, then isn't there a good data-minimisation case to be made for profiling down the information returned to the requestor?\u00a0 I think one can validly argue that the answers we arrived at in 2009 (for 5460) might not be those on which we'd reach consensus today, but this draft seems to (quite understandably) assume that 2009's answers are still good enough.\u00a0 Did the WG consider that?  (4) Having TLS is good. But I don't get why you've not reversed the TLS client/server roles to make the requester the TLS server, since it seems to me that authenticating and authorizing the requestor here is the main thing and not authenticating the DHCP server. So why not reverse the TLS roles? (I'll clear this quickly but wanted to check in case it'd not occurred to folks.)  (5) The TLS mutual authentication requirement is underspecified. The sentence in 9.1 isn't really enough I think, you need to say that all TLS sessions MUST be mutually authenticated and then that has administrative consequences that might need more text. For example, the DHCP servers need to trust the set of CAs that requestors use - is it ok to be just silent on that?\u00a0 I also wonder about naming and other things - does there need to be some profile of how the DHCP server is named vs. a TLS certificate?  (6) Why not just make the use of TLS mandatory or RECOMMENDED here anyway - would that really hurt?",
