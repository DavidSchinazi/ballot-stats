It is important and easy to read (even if I may have missed some points, hence my DISCUSS ballot). Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points, some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Jie Dong for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus, alas there is no justification for the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Section 3.6 unknown ? ``` \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 sub-TLV types: Zero or more sub-TLV types that are unknown or \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 unsupported by the node originating the BGP-LS advertisement.\u00a0 The \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 size of each sub-TLV type depends on the protocol indicated by the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Protocol-ID field.\u00a0 For example, for IS-IS each sub-TLV type would \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be of size 1 byte while for OSPF each sub-TLV type would be of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 size 2 bytes. ``` How would an originating node know that some TLVs are unknown to it ? I am probably missing something obvious here, but some clarification text would be welcome. Or simply use 'unsupported'.",
