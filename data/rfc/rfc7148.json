However, the document doesn't provide much guidance in general in terms of logging/reporting.

Also, in some cases\u00a0 it is not clear if packets should be silently discarded (e.g. section 5.1.4 Packet Forwarding) or logged and discarded.

        "text": "DISCUSS item 1: In 3.2.2, paragraph 2, the text doesn't really describe what's happening in the diagram. Not only is this a usability issue for vision-challenged readers, you're glossing over some very weird behavior here.\u00a0  I would suggest the following change: OLD: \u00a0  Once the mobile access gateway gets the set of \u00a0  delegated prefixes from the delegating router function running on the \u00a0  local mobility anchor, it conveys it in a proxy binding update.\u00a0 This \u00a0  ensures that the local mobility anchor properly routes the traffic \u00a0  addressed to the delegated prefixes via the PMIPv6 tunnel established \u00a0  with the mobile access gateway, and that mobility is provided to \u00a0  these prefixes while the mobile router roams within the PMIPv6 \u00a0  domain. NEW: \u00a0  If the client did not request Rapid Commit, or the LMA doesn't \u00a0  support it, the relay agent on the MAG will behave normally in \u00a0  accordance with  RFC 3315  in handling the Advertise message \u00a0  from the DR and the Request message from the RR.\u00a0  However, \u00a0  the MAG does not strictly follow  RFC3315  in its handling of the \u00a0  Reply message. \u00a0  When the MAG receives the DHCPv6 Reply message from the \u00a0  LMA, it extracts the DMNP from the Reply message and \u00a0  sends a PBU to the LMA containing the DMNP from the \u00a0  Reply message.\u00a0  When the PBA comes back from the \u00a0  LMA containing the DMNP, the Reply message is forwarded \u00a0  to the client. I realize that the intention here was to gloss over this and leave it for the interworking stuff that isn't specified in this document, but what you are doing to the relay function in the MAG here is sufficiently weird that I think you need to call it out explicitly. You can resolve this DISCUSS item by making the change I've proposed above, or explaining why that's not the right thing to do. I am also concerned that you haven't accounted for any of the things that can go awry during this process, but I am reluctant to demand that you fully flesh out the interworking, and that is what you would have to do to address this problem.\u00a0  You do not need to address this point to clear the DISCUSS, but I'm mentioning it here because it concerns me and is related to the first DISCUSS item. DISCUSS item 2: I'm noticing in 5.1.3.2 that you are talking about IPv4 prefixes, but of course  RFC3633  does not support IPv4 prefixes.\u00a0  What's the intention here?\u00a0  To resolve this DISCUSS item you need to explain what was intended here and possibly negotiate a fix. DISCUSS item 3: You never talk about how the identity of the MR that is presented over DHCPv6 will be correlated with the identity of the MR that is presented over PMIPv6.\u00a0  This seems like an important detail.\u00a0  Have you thought about it?\u00a0  Why isn't it described here?\u00a0  To resolve this DISCUSS item, you need to answer these questions and possibly add some text, with which I will be happy to help.",
