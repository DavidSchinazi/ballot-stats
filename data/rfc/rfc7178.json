The correct 5226 policy is \"RFC Required\" (not \"RFC Publication\"). 2. What's the reason for requiring IETF Review for more than one request? \u00a0If someone has a document in the Independent Stream and needs two codes, this means that it has to be re-routed through the IETF Stream or split into two ISE documents -- both of which might not make sense. \u00a0If it's just that you want someone to sanity-check requests for multiple values, you could make that \"IESG Approval\" instead of \"IETF Review\". \u00a0That would allow the IESG to block multiple-value registrations through the Independent Stream if necessary, but to choose to approve them without forcing the RFC to go through the IETF Stream.",
