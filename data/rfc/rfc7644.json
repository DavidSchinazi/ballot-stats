What are the alternatives--that is, can you envision situations where it might be reasonable to _not_ ignore parameters you don't understand? -- 3.4.2.2, reference to [Order-Operations] As written, that needs to be a normative reference. That's problematic for a reference to wikipedia, since articles are extremely changeable. Furthermore, the referenced article doesn\u2019t indicate one true operator precedence for programming languages. If the rest of the paragraph fully defines the precedence, I suggest saying \u201cMUST\u2026 according to the following\u201d, and making the reference truly informational (or even dropping it entirely.) -- 3.8: The first paragraph says servers MUST respond with JSON in UTF-8. But the following paragraphs talk about how the client may request different response formats. This seems contradictory. -- 3.13: It's optional (MAY) to include the API version. If the version is missing, the service provider SHOULD perform the operation using the most recent supported version. This seems to allow the client and service provider to disagree on the version being used. Does this cause an interop problem if the later version is not backwards compatible? (Are all new versions expected to be backwards compatible with old versions?)",

        "text": "Thanks for your work on this draft.\u00a0 I have a few items I'd like to discuss and have provided suggestions to help the discussion.\u00a0 I think this should be fairly easy to get through. 1. OAuth is used for authorization and is limited to insecure methods of authentication via HTTP supported methods and of those, OAuth only has a few registered.\u00a0 HTTP Basic authentication is the default, which is horrible.\u00a0 Later in this draft, SCIM encourages the use of asymmetric crypto.\u00a0 Can this be the preferred option and there be more details listed on how to do with (references)? What is specified now is really an authorization protocol, so you'll need to say if HTTP Basic is what's used for authentication with OAuth (default) or something else and then the security considerations for OAuth bearer tokens and HHTP Basic.\u00a0 Here are some links to help: A reference to security considerations from this draft will be needed: see:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-assertions Reference to the HTTP Basic draft will be needed to show the security issues with this option:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpauth-basicauth-update/ OAuth can't use something like HOBA in  RFC7486 , which was designed to avoid the need for passwords when using HTTP Authentication.\u00a0 Can SCIM work directly with other HTTP Auth methods like HOBA? The OAuth folks are thinking about this problem, but aren't there yet (non-password auth methods to then use Oauth authorization tokens).  2. The Holder-of-Key Assertions would get you a lot more security than the bearer token.\u00a0 Why are all the examples bearer token?\u00a0 Or is there no support for proof of possession of the key? 3. Section 7.1 I'm guessing the text on TLS versions is old and this was overlooked in last call.\u00a0 The minimum version that should be supported is 1.2.\u00a0 TLS 1.0 is not considered a good starting point these days and browsers, such as Chrome show it as obsolete.\u00a0 The text on implementation information for TLS 1.2 is no longer correct, it's widely implemented and is pretty much the standard at the moment (1.3 will be soon enough).\u00a0 Referencing the TLS BCP would be preferred,  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uta-tls-bcp/ .\u00a0 It not only starts from v1.2, but includes preferred algorithms and other configuration/implementation details to avoid attacks.\u00a0 It is close to final publication and is ahead int he queue of this draft. 4. Section 7.2 Please review the Privacy Considerations,  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973 .\u00a0 I was expecting to see more specific guidance as to what needs to be protected and options to protect the data since there is quite a bit of personal information passed in this protocol.\u00a0 We care about this for the protection of user's privacy, not just because it is required by laws.\u00a0 You can leave mention of the laws out, but it would be helpful to be specific on options to protect the data or options to leave out certain data elements to protect privacy (such as, make them optional or provide a way to encrypt/obscure, etc.).\u00a0  RFC6973  will help with current guidance and IETF considerations.\u00a0 If it is a per element or attribute consideration, a pointer to that text from the privacy considerations section to the schema draft may be more appropriate than covering the options in this draft.\u00a0 Then\u00a0 a better TLS option will help as well so the session is less subject to attacks. I see there is some text on privacy n the schema draft, but it's probably not enough.\u00a0 I'll read that within the next few days and give feedback to help improve the text.",
