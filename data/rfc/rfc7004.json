Shortening a little here (and assuming that \"packets loss\" should be \"packets lost\"), I think you mean for the formula to be >>\u00a0 integer-part( (PLB / TPEB) * 32767 )\u00a0 << So, if the total packets expected in bursts (TPEB) is 2,591, and the packets lost in bursts (PLB) is 39, then the Burst Loss Rate value should be 493, or 0x01ED.\u00a0 Do I have that right? Assuming I understand correctly, I think a little change would have helped my confusion.\u00a0 Would you mind doing these four items this way (again, using this one as an example)?: NEW \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 at the left edge of the field.\u00a0 This value is calculated by \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dividing Packets Lost in Bursts by Total Packets Expected in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 32767 (0x7FFF), \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and keeping only the integer part.\u00a0 The maximum value is thus \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7FFF.\u00a0 Representing this as a formula: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 integer-part( (Packets Lost in Bursts / Total Packets Expected in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bursts) * 0x7FFF ) END Do you see where I was confused before?\u00a0 Does a change like this work for you? I'll also note that the \"binary point\" (I presume this is a binary variant of \"decimal point\") is not actually at the left edge of the field.\u00a0 For one thing, the left-most bit is always 0 for any valid value, so the point is at least one bit to the right of that.\u00a0 For another, a value of \"1\" (total loss) is represented not by \"1.000 0000 0000 0000\", but by \"0.111 1111 1111 1111\".\u00a0 I don't know how to describe that in terms of the binary point, but I don't think saying that the binary point is at the left edge works.\u00a0 But if the rest of the description is clear about how to compute the value, I think you can just remove that bit. (I actually don't understand why you don't multiply by 32768 (0x1000), and use 0xFFFF as the unknown value, because that does put the binary point in a sensible place, and has total loss represented as \"1.000 0000 0000 0000\".\u00a0 I see that you do use 0xFFFF as the unknown value for some of the other fields (such as Burst Duration Mean and Burst Duration Variance).\u00a0 Why not be consistent?)",

However, there is a precedent in  RFC 3611  for this descriptive text, so it makes sense to use the same style in this document.\u00a0 But, I don't think the computation still quite yields the right result - why multiply by 0x7FF rather than 0x10000 (the equivalent of 0x100 as used in  RFC 3611  for an 8-bit field)? Here's my suggestion, based on Barry's text and using  RFC 3611  as a template: NEW \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The fraction of packets lost during bursts since the beginning of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 reception, expressed as a fixed point number with the binary point \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 at the left edge of the field.\u00a0 This value is calculated by \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dividing Packets Lost in Bursts by Total Packets Expected in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Bursts, multiplying the result of the division by 65536, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 limiting the maximum value to 65535 (to avoid overflow)  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and keeping only the integer part.\u00a0 This field MUST be populated \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and MUST be set to zero if no packets have been received.
