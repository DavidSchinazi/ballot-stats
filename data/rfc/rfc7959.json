With my initial ready I assumed that this extension would allow the sending of back-to-back messages. Only by looking at the examples, it got clear to me that this is not the case.  Further, this document does not say anything about reliability. Do block message need to be transmitted reliable (as Confirmable)? If not, this extension could still lead to back-to-back sending and then further guidance on congestion control would be needed.",
