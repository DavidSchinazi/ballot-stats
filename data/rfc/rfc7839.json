        "text": "I have some questions about this draft. They derive from the position that some of the values in the options specified can reveal sensitive information about the mobile user. I would put access network name (especially when it's SSID, since people put identifying information in SSIDs), access point name, and BSSID in that category at a minimum. The draft specifies DHCP options for downstream use in PMIPv6 scenarios, but makes no mention about actually limiting the use of these options to those scenarios. It's not clear to me whether those limits could be achieved in any case, since an AP won't know a priori whether it is being deployed in a service-provider-WiFi or cellular context or not. So what is the authors' expectation about the breadth of deployment of these options? Every DHCP stack? Something less than that? Furthermore, are any of the individual fields required or optional?  RFC 6757  indicates that within PMIPv6 only the ATT is required. Given the drawbacks discussed in Section 9, why was DHCP the protocol chosen for this? Is there no other protocol that APs speak to MAGs that has confidentiality, integrity protection, and authentication support? If DHCP is the only choice, why are none of the security fixes normatively required (\"confidentiality and integrity protection should be employed,\" \"DHCP server administrators are strongly advised to configure DHCP servers ... using IPsec,\" \"administrators have to consider disabling the capability specified\")? Why would an LMA need the MAC address of the AP? Are there examples of policies that mobile networks have in place that apply differently to two devices connected to the same SSID but different APs, for example? I looked for this in  RFC 6757  too but did not see it. Given the potential sensitivity of this field it seems like a justification for sharing it in an eavesdroppable way needs to be provided.",

Having looked back at the email thread I don't believe I got any  answer to the question \"Did the DHC working group consider how  this information, when sent without adequate protection between  relay and dhcp server, could help in pervasive monitoring?\" I think the focus of the discussion has been on the applicability of  this being limited to \"typically\" one operator's network, which  does of course mean that the traffic is less at risk than had it  transited many networks. However, we have seen (Belgacom) that  the PM threat also applies within a single operator's network. So I am still interested in the answer to the above question. The DHC WG might consider this threat and still conclude that a SHOULD statement about IPsec is the best we can do in practice,  but that isn't clear to me at present, so I'd still like to chat about  the PM threat. (Note: it's the WG's consideration of the threat  I'd like to chat about, not only about the potential of IPsec to  mitigate that threat.)",
