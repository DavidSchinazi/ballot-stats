This is just an example of a issue that is exists in basically all of the  RFC 2119  terminolgy using sentences in this section. The formulation is that the offerer or answerer must do something with attributes or parameters of the dcmap attribute. However, it is not stated to be specific to the dcmap attribute that specifically specify something for a T.140 SCTP stream. I think that scope restriction needs to be made more explicit for these  RFC 2119  statements. Else they would have applicability as soon as one support this specification.",

In  RFC 4103  Section 6 it says receivers MUST be able to handle temporary bursts over the cps rate but senders MUST stay below the rate. In section 5.3 it says senders \u201ccan\u201d (probably need a 2119 word here) buffer blocks to stay below cps. There is a 500ms limit so this has its limitations. Shouldn\u2019t the buffer time be unbounded if characters are coming in at a rate above cps? Meanwhile in section 4.2.1 it suggests that receivers use sendOnly or inactive (I presume these are the right direction values) to effectively flow control the incoming data. 4566bis seems to only envision this at the start of a channel. What is the impact of pending data if the directionality of the channel changes? How does this interact with the maximum buffer time? I suggest 4.2.1 be clearer on what actions a cps sender and receiver MAY/SHOULD/MUST take, and make sure there aren\u2019t contradictory requirements.",
