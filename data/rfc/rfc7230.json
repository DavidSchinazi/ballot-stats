And I think this is easily addressed: Throughout the document (and the other documents in the series), the ABNF for the header fields does not include the name of the header field. For instance, in 3.3.1, you have: \u00a0  Transfer-Encoding = 1#transfer-coding But the proper syntax for TE would be: \u00a0  Transfer-Encoding = \"Transfer-Encoding:\" OWS 1#transfer-coding If you want to come up with a different syntax, where the rule name itself gets included with a colon and optional whitespace before the right hand side of the rule I suppose you could do that, but that's going to be seriously weird mixing of ABNF with something magic and new.",

A) I really hate to make this a discuss but after having seen and been schooled by the applications area in the art of media type registrations, I'm *shocked* to find that there are *no* security considerations, no interoperability concerns, and no applications that use this media type documented in the media type application!?\u00a0 Shouldn't the security considerations at least point to the security considerations of this draft, and the interoperability section point to say \"See [RFC-to-Be]\" and the application that use this draft be something like \"lots\" ;)  B) s8.6: This has to have been discussed @ length so this might be quick: I'm a little concerned by the FCFS nature of the registry that doesn't require a specification - well I'm most concerned about the lack of security review if there's no specification.\u00a0 Is everybody else okay with this?",

        "text": "Point 1: In 2.7.1, end of last paragraph: \u00a0  Before making use of an \"http\" URI \u00a0  reference received from an untrusted source, a recipient ought to \u00a0  parse for userinfo and treat its presence as an error; it is likely \u00a0  being used to obscure the authority for the sake of phishing attacks. Why no normative language here?\u00a0  I'm assuming this was deliberate, but it seems like the wrong call.\u00a0  Why not propose that the recipient reject this out of hand, unless there's some strong reason not to?\u00a0 \u00a0 I expect that you will explain why you made this decision and it will make sense to me, in which case that will resolve this DISCUSS point; otherwise, changing \"ought to\" to \"SHOULD\" would also satisfy.\u00a0  The referenced section of  RFC 3986  has some good text on why this is important, but this document doesn't repeat much of it, so I'm concerned that a new reader wouldn't really get the significance of this advice. Point 2: In 5.5, suppose I connect to  foo.example.org  on port 80, and send the following: \u00a0 GET / HTTP/1.1 \u00a0 Host:  foo.example.org:8080 This produces an effective URI of  http://foo.example.org:8080/ .\u00a0  What is the server supposed to do at this point? The obvious way to resolve this DISCUSS point is to update the text to address this problem.\u00a0  I think this example has the same property that leads you to require a 301 or 400 status in section 3.1.1. Point 3: In 3.2.4, paragraph 1: \u00a0  server MUST reject any received request message that contains \u00a0  whitespace between a header field-name and colon with a response code \u00a0  of 400 (Bad Request).\u00a0 A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace from a \u00a0  response message before forwarding the message downstream. Why the different handling in the two cases?\u00a0  Is it really less bad (and hence salvageable in the response?\u00a0  What if a user agent receives such whitespace?\u00a0  I expect you'll address this point by explaining why this is an issue in requests and not in responses, or else by at least adding text about how user agents should deal with this situation.\u00a0  I am asking this question based on the inconsistency I see here, not any special insight I have into the problem, so I'm assuming there's a straightforward explanation.",
