I have a small set of questions which I would like to discuss before recommending approval of this document: 1) In 10.4.\u00a0 Peer Offer Signal \u00a0  A Peer Offer Signal MUST be sent by a DLEP modem in response to a \u00a0  properly formatted and addressed Peer Discovery Signal \u00a0  (Section 10.3). \u00a0  A Peer Offer Signal MUST be encoded within a UDP packet.\u00a0 The IP \u00a0  destination MUST be set to the IP address and port number received in \u00a0  the corresponding Peer Discovery Signal.\u00a0 The source IP address MUST \u00a0  be set to the modem's IP address associated with the DLEP interface. \u00a0  The source port number MUST be set to the DLEP well-known port \u00a0  number. The port number can be omitted to signal that the well-known port number is to be used (as per 11.2 and 11.3). It looks like requiring that the source port is always a well-known port is an error here. 2) In 10.17: \u00a0  If metrics are supplied with the Message (e.g., Resources), these \u00a0  metrics are MUST be applied to all destinations identified in the \u00a0  Message. Nit: extra \"are\" before \"MUST\". Question: how can multiple destinations be specified? \u00a0  Note that this may overwrite metrics provided in a \u00a0  previously received Session or Destination Up Messages. 3) 12.\u00a0 Security Considerations \u00a0  At the transport layer, implementations of DLEP SHOULD implement, and \u00a0  use, TLS [ RFC5246 ] to protect the TCP session.\u00a0 Deployments that are \u00a0  protected by strong physical security (e.g., deployments where the \u00a0  DLEP router and modem are the only devices on a physical Layer 2 \u00a0  segment) may consider use of DLEP without TLS.\u00a0 When TLS is in use, \u00a0  each peer SHOULD check the validity of credentials presented by the \u00a0  other peer during TLS session extablishment.\u00a0 Refer to [ RFC7525 ] for \u00a0  additional details. How can credentials presented by the other peer can be validated? RFC 7525  is referencing  RFC 6125 , which talks about hostname validation, which is something which might not apply to DLEP deployments?",

RFC 7525  that you are referencing contains recommendations on version of TLS and ciphersuites to use. Section 6.1 of  RFC 7525  talks about \"Host Name Validation\". I don't think this section applies to DLEP. So can you elaborate on how server identity is going to be verified using pre-shared keys and which parts of  RFC 7525  do you think apply to DLEP?",
