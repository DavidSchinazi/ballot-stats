Ok, so 0b0000 ==> (0 + 1) * 4, means 4 bits. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 OTL = 0b111 means the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  origination time is 7 hex digits (28 bits) long.

        "text": "The Gen-ART reviewer made the following observation, which I'd like to discuss: There is a serious problem with the last 5 paragraphs of section 8, \"Synchronization Aspects\":\u00a0 they seem to assume that the time representation for the Deadline Time and Origination Time values will wrap around, that is, that the representation is the absolute value modulo the size of the field.\u00a0 In addition, there is a lack of clarity how the new epoch point will be chosen after the value wraps around. This seems to contradict the earlier sections of the document which speak of the values as if they are always to be considered as absolute values on a time scale selected by the TU field, viz., either the NTP time scale (in seconds) or the network's ASN numbering. It's possible that four of these paragraphs are intended to only apply to the use of TU = 00, the NTP time scale, and perhaps that usage of the header is understood not to be completely specified yet. However, the final paragraph discusses TU = 10 (the ASN time scale), and claims that wrapping of the DT value is intended.\u00a0 This is relevant to current implementations. Some sort of resolution of this is needed; as the document stands it is self-inconsistent.\u00a0 One possible resolution would be to omit these paragraphs.",
