Also, I think we need to more strongly reiterate the cross-algorithm risk, specifically mentioned in Section 2.1.1 of draft-ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs-09 , regarding an attacker changing headers from secp256r1 to secp256k1 (or vice versa), and that the only known way to deal with this attack is to limit any given protocol participant to using at most one of the two curves.\u00a0 (AFAIK neither 'alg' nor 'crv' are required to be protected elements, so while limiting this curve to the ES256K algorithm helps in many cases, is not a fail-safe.) Finally, my apologies for not catching this earlier, but the COSE charter says that the WG deliverable to \"define the algorithms needed for W3C Web Authentication for COSE\" is to be an Informational document. It looks like we didn't notice that when the WG -00 was submitted and it has just been carried through unchanged.\u00a0 (Note, however, that the requested values for ES256K and secp256k1 are in the \"Standards Action\" range and would not be available for an informational document.)",
