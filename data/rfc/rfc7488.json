If the PCP client is still trying to contact a PCP server, why would it willingly ignore a valid response?\u00a0 If I have 3 addresses for the PCP server and am in the process of trying address 3, what is wrong with accepting a late response that arrives from address 2? I am also confused about the SHOULD in this bullet that says \"If, when sending PCP requests, the PCP client receives a hard ICMP error [ RFC1122 ] it SHOULD immediately try the next IP address from the list of PCP server IP addresses.\"\u00a0 If it is a hard error, isn't this a MUST?",
