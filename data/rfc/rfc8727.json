The JSON \"examples\" seem to be using a \"//\" notation for comments, that is not valid JSON nor described by  draft-zyp-json-schema , thus appearing to make the examples malformed (absent some other disclaimer of the commenting convention). How does STRUCTUREDINFO relate to EXTENSION?\u00a0 What makes one vs the other appropriate for a given piece of information?\u00a0 Since the former is only in\u00a0  RFC 7203  and not 7970, we do not have an easy reference for their interplay, given 7970's minimal discussion of the use of 7203. (It sounds like STRUCTUREDINFO is for structures from other published specifications and EXTENSION is for more local/custom things, but I'm not entirely sure if that's exactly the intended split.)
