Things are evolving so rapidly that, with respect to several of the new parts of this document (e.g., the last few paragraphs of Sec. 6.1.1, Sec. 6.1.1.1, Sec. 6.1.1.2), an immutable summary designed to represent reality over the long term doesn't really seem feasible right now. Why not wait to see how QUIC, DOH, ADD, ODNS, etc. shake out in the next few years and take this up then? == Section 6.1.1.2 == \"Users will only be aware of and have the ability to control such \u00a0  settings if applications provide the following functions: \u00a0  o communicate clearly the change in default to users \u00a0  o provide configuration options to change the default \u00a0  o provide configuration options to always use the system resolver\" This doesn't seem true. If the third bullet isn't provided, users still have awareness and control. Also, the bullets seem redundant with the text above, as if this is saying \"users only have awareness and control if they have awareness and control.\" As a result I'm not sure what this text is really meant to convey.",
