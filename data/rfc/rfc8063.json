I looked at the archive and saw essentially no discussion, other than the announcement. I also looked at the application and it's not crystal clear to me at least that none of the claims are relevant. The shepherd write-up also doesn't help me, but of course there may have been discussion in a f2f meeting that is documented in minutes or something - I've not checked for such, or I may have missed out on some list traffic. Anyway, the DISCUSS is to ask did I miss stuff and if not how can WG participants have rationally considered an IPR declaration if the licensing information will only arrive \"later\" after the document is approved to become an RFC?\u00a0 (Note: If I am explicitly told that this was considered and participants were ok with the declaration even as-is, then I'll clear.)  (2) So I can see at least two ways in which this kind of thing can be done and you don't clearly say which this supports. Option (a) would be for the gaining DNS operator to provide new public keys to the losing operator for inclusion before a transfer so that continuity is maintained during the transfer. Option (b) would be where the KSK private material is not known by either operator, but e.g. by the registrant. In the case of option (b) the DNSKEY would be transferred from the losing to the gaining DNS operator. (And the arrow in Figure 1 would be in the other direction.) I think you need to be clear about which of these cases is actually being supported and about the overall sequence of events needed. (If you tell me that you really want to do whatever is in draft-koch, then that's fine but then this draft is probably premature and draft-koch would need to be a normative ref.)",
