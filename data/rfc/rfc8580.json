I plan to ballot \"yes\", but have one item I think needs to be discussed first: The security considerations say that this extension adds no new considerations not already present in [ RFC5228 ], [ RFC5230 ], [ RFC5435 ], and [ RFC6131 ]. I'm not sure that that is true.  It seems like the ability to insert a copy of message into a mailbox might have security and/or privacy considerations. This seems analogous to the \"fileinto\" action. I looked for security considerations for that in  RFC 5228 . All I found was a statement that \"fileinfo\" can be dangerous, but no elaboration on the nature of the danger or how it might be mitigated. So while I agree that fcc would have similar considerations as \"fileinfo\", I'm not sure those considerations have been adequately documented.\u00a0 (I expect people will point me to something I missed, or where some other analogous feature is documented, in which case I will clear.)",
