The ABNF doesn't restrict the value, but it is important for interoperability 2) In 5.3: urgency is defined as a list of one or more values. The description says that it defines the lowest value allowed. There is also a sentence prohibiting multiple values. Why is this a set and how would multiple values be interpreted? 3) In 6: I don't know where the \":link\" Pseudo-Header field came from. Can you clarify where it is defined?",

(1) This might just me being confused (in which case, sorry) but I'm not quite clear on how with works with the SOP.\u00a0 Given you (reasonably) recommend a different port (which is a different origin than 443) are you saying here that the SOP doesn't apply to the client? (Well, actually you don't say, so I'm not sure:-) If the SOP applies, how is the port change handled? If the SOP does not apply, then what does? (Given that I assume some UAs at least will not change their handling of the SOP no matter what we say here.) (2) So-called \"capability URLs\" (is that a new term here? seems like it could be the topic for a useful informational rfc) are clearly weak, but also clearly as good as we'll get for some things.\u00a0 However, those also become known over time, (in which case they are toast;-) so why don't you need to provide a way for a push service to say \"hey, instead of\u00a0 in future you'll need to use \"? If that could be done as an extension later, then I'd be ok with that in terms of clearing the discuss, but then I think you'd need to mention it, so that applications and UAs don't build in an assumption that these URLs are fixed for all time (while also needing to be kept \"secret\" as with other bearer tokens). (3) Why is it not correct to encourage mutual-auth TLS for the application to push-service connections?\u00a0 I'm not arguing to make that mandatory, but it's not that hard in many cases and is very useful, esp since without some client auth just knowing the URL will often enable a sender to send a crap load of updates to possibly many bandwidth/power-challenged UAs. (This is only a discuss because of that potential DoS vector.) (4) Is it really honest to say that the W3C Push API, webpush encryption and vapid are only informative references? The first seems easy to make normative, the second I think really needs to exist before we ought recommend this all get out into the wild and I'm not clear if one could sensibly make a service for this without the 3rd. Yes that might add some delay to the RFC being issued, but that might be the right thing to do. Why is it right to not wait on those two IDs and the w3c rec? This is mainly a discuss in case the answer is \"we know nobody's gonna do webpush-encryption ever\" in which case I'd like to be convinced that implementing and deploying based on this draft without reading those references defines a good standard. I'm not saying that it does not, I'm saying I'm not yet convinced.",
