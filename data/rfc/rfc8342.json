The introductions says,  \"This architectural framework identifies a set of conceptual datastores but \u00a0  it does not mandate that all network management protocols expose all \u00a0  these conceptual datastores.\u00a0 This architecture is agnostic with \u00a0  regard to the encoding used by network management protocols.\" As such, the data stores could be exposed for some implementations, using whatever network management protocol (likely NetCONF or RESTCONF).\u00a0 If this is the case, why doesn't at least some of the security considerations template apply for at least secure transport? 2. Section 5.3.4 - Is there any integrity protection on the origin information?\u00a0 If not, can it be added or is there a good reason why it\u2019s not possible?\u00a0 I realize these are conceptual models that may or may not be exposed, but if exposed and used, wouldn\u2019t some integrity protection on this be helpful? Thanks in advance!",
