The DISCUSS point: Along with that, the document says, at the start of Section 5, \"Several working groups developing application-layer protocols have expressed a desire to use the JOSE data formats in their designs for end-to-end security features.\"\u00a0 What are those working groups (the subsections indicate at least OAUTH, XMPP, ALTO, ATOCA, CORE, and W3C Web Crypto), and, apart from OAUTH, which is mentioned in the writeup, have the others of those reviewed this document?",
