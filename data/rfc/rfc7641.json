One very temporary point: Has anyone done a comparison between this work and the server push aspects of HTTP/2?\u00a0 Is there any value in trying to align the two?  It's unclear to me from the text of Section 2 how the 0/1 register/deregister values are used.\u00a0 Are these reserved values out of the sequence number space?\u00a0 Or are they carried somewhere else in the option?\u00a0 I infer from Section 3.6 that the answer is the former, but Section 2 should be explicit about this.\u00a0  In fact, it seems like it's not necessary to reserve the value 1 at all, since the server must interpret any positive value as deregistration.\u00a0 Calling out 1 as special invites server implementations to screw this up. \"the time elapsed between the two incoming messages is not so large that the difference between V1 and V2 has become larger than the largest integer that it is meaningful to add to a 24-bit serial number\" The text seems confused about whether the value of the Observe option is a serial number or a time value.\u00a0 The definition says that it's a serial number, but this sentence implies that it's somehow related to time.\u00a0 In order to avoid clients making unwarranted assumptions about the value of the Observe option, it seems important to clarify this.",
