I have another reason than Roman to discuss this particular sentence. First of all what is the intention of which HTTP version should be supported here?  And which protocol are the port 443 you are recommending, TCP, UDP or SCTP? This also relates to HTTP/3 as it is getting close to being published, we can expect that in the future maybe people would like to upgrade to HTTP/3. Already now I am wondering if the written allow for HTTP/2 over TLS/TCP? Note, that I am mostly commenting from the perspective if you want to be specific that it is HTTP/1.1. over TLS/TCP that is the goal. Then this document should make certain changes in the formulation. If you want to be unspecific and don't think that will hurt interoperability, then another formulation that the current is also needed. Likely also a discussion about how a client will figure out what versions are supported. And maybe one of the ART ADs can help untangle if  RFC 2818  really is the right normative reference here? Or if it should be  RFC 7230  and possibly additional references for HTTP/2?",

Sec 2.3 of -architecture says: At minimum, the API MUST provide: (1) the state of captivity and (2) a URI for the Captive Portal Server. But in section 5 user-portal-url is an optional field. Is -architecture actually levying a requirement on the api spec, or the api server? I am also confused by this sentence at the end of section 4.1 about failed authentication: \u201cIt may still be possible for the user to access the network by being redirected to a web portal.\u201d Who is doing the redirecting here?
