In this text: 10.4.5.\u00a0 Failover \u00a0  If the Collecting Process does not acknowledge an attempt by the \u00a0  Exporting Process to establish a connection, TCP will automatically \u00a0  retry connection establishment using exponential backoff. The \u00a0  Exporter MAY log an alarm if the time to establish the association \u00a0  exceeds a specified threshold, configurable on the Exporter. I'm somewhat confused about this description. I agree with the first sentence about TCP behavior, but is there any behavior at the IPFIX layer that you would like to specify, if the Exporting Process can't open a connection quickly enough? Does it matter whether TCP is still exponentially backing off on SYN retransmissions, or has finally given up and returned an error? I note that  RFC 5101  talks about RESETing TCP connections, but I'm not seeing equivalent text in this draft. I think I have the same question about 10.2.5\u00a0 Failover, for SCTP, but the question occurred to me while looking at 10.4.5.",

FORMER DISCUSS: I see a lot of cases of definitions for attributes of option templates where the text defining the attribute has been removed since  RFC5101 , and [IANA-IPFIX] is given as a reference where the definitions can be found.\u00a0  For example in section 4.3, the definitions for notSentFlowTotalCount, notSentPacketTotalCount and notSentOctetTotalCount.

It might help to add a terminology section on \"packet treatment.\"\u00a0  However, this depends on the target readership, so I'm by no means demanding that such a section be added; simply suggesting it based on the fact that I stumbled over the term when reading the document. It seems unnecessary to repeat \"network byte order (also known as big-endian byte order)\" throughout the document.\u00a0  It might be better to just say \"network byte order (also known as big-endian byte order)\" the first time, and just \"network byte order\" subsequently. In 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, the floating point format is specified as IEEE 754 in network byte order.\u00a0  IEEE 754 doesn't specify a network byte ordering for floating point numbers.\u00a0  I think the encoding is fairly straightforward, but I am not convinced that a reader of this document who did not already know what IEEE 754 encoding in network byte order means would be able to figure it out.\u00a0  It would help to have a reference here to a document that defines what \"network byte order\" means here, or just a quick statement about how the bytes are arranged. In 8.2, there's a paragraph that's supposed to clarify the applicability of templates to data records that's got such a big parse stack it left my head spinning.\u00a0  I propose the following change: OLD: \u00a0  Put another way, a Template describes Data Records contained in IPFIX \u00a0  Messages with an Export Time between the Export Time of the IPFIX \u00a0  Message containing the Template Record and either the Export Time of \u00a0  the IPFIX Message containing the Template Withdrawal withdrawing it \u00a0  or the end of the Transport Session, inclusive. NEW: \u00a0  Put another way, a Template describes Data Records contained in IPFIX \u00a0  messages when the export time of such messages is between a \u00a0  specific start and end time.\u00a0  The start time is the Export Time of the IPFIX \u00a0  Message containing the Template record.\u00a0  The end time is one of two \u00a0  times.\u00a0  If the template is withdrawn during the session, then it is the \u00a0  Export Time of the IPFIX message containing the Template Withdrawal \u00a0  for the template.\u00a0  Otherwise, it is the end of the Transport Session. In the last paragraph of the first part of section 9, the text does not mention the handling of a malformed message in the case of TCP transport.\u00a0  I think in this case there is no way to resynchronize, because it's impossible to characterize the error that caused the malformed message.\u00a0  That being the case, doesn't the TCP connection have to be dropped when a malformed message is encountered?\u00a0  Shouldn't this be mentioned either in Section 9 or Section 10.4? Overall this update to  RFC 5101  looks like a significant improvement.\u00a0  Thanks for doing it!",
