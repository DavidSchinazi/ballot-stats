        "text": "Thank you for this quite masterfully done mammoth undertaking!\u00a0 I expect to ballot Yes pending discussion of one point. I'm looking at the following text in Section 4.3.4 relating to how to handle certificate validation failures for https: \u00a0  If the certificate is not valid for the URI's origin server, a user \u00a0  agent MUST either notify the user (user agents MAY give the user an \u00a0  option to continue with the connection in any case) or terminate the \u00a0  connection with a bad certificate error.\u00a0 [...] Given the discussion up in \u00a73.5 about requirements to \"notify\" the user vs requiring \"confirmation\" from the user, I don't think that just \"MUST notify the user\" is sufficient to prevent the user-agent from continuing, since it is sufficient to just write a log entry as the means to notify the user.\u00a0 Is the intent to require confirmation of the action to continue in the face of such an error (which, again per \u00a73.5 could be a pre-configured confirmation)?\u00a0 An intent to require \"confirmation\" (vs mere \"notification\") seems consistent with the subsequent text placing requirements on automated clients and would be more consistent with my understanding of general IETF consensus for securing protocols",
