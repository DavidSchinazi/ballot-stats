Please find below two blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education). Special thanks to Matthew Bocci for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus and the justification of the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric # DISCUSS (blocking) As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Missing normative references Even experienced authors sometimes forget to add normative references to  RFC 2119  and  RFC 8174  ;-) ## Section 4.4 Probably due to my lack of knowledge about EVPN and  RFC 9136  et al, but I wonder how the length of the \"IP Prefix\" field can be known by the receiver ? There is a \"IP Prefix length\" field but it seems to indicate the prefix length, e.g., \"IP Prefix Len\" field could be 32 bit but the \"IP Prefix\" field itself could be the 128-bit value of 2001:db8:: May I strongly suggest adding clarification text if my understanding is incorrect ?",

        "text": "Section 4.1: EVPN MAC/IP Sub-TLV This Sub-TLV appears to be used for both EVPN MAC/IP and PBB-EVPN. The content of the TLV contains information for EVPN taken from [ RFC7432 ] and PBB-EVPN taken from [ RFC7623 ]. This begs the question as to why these are both merged into the same Sub-TLV rather than have separate Sub-TLVs. The name of the Sub-TLV implies it's for EVPN but it is not exclusively for that. Also, there are fields in the TLV such as Ethernet Tag ID that are relevant only to PBB-EVPN (or vice versa) so I assume that these would be set to zero if not used (?) but the document does not specify this.  Section 8:1: Sub-type TLV \u00a0  This document defines four new Sub-TLV type to be included in Target \u00a0  FEC Stack TLV (TLV Type 1, 16 and 21) [ RFC8029 ] in Echo Request and \u00a0  Echo Reply messages in EVPN and PBB-EVPN network. The reference to  RFC8029  looks incorrect. I think this is referring to  RFC9041  and if so, the reference should be corrected. The Target FEC Stack TLV sub-TLVs are in this registry  https://www.iana.org/assignments/mpls-lsp-ping-parameters/mpls-lsp-ping-parameters.xhtml#sub-tlv-1-16-21 . \u00a0  IANA is requested to assign lowest 4 free values for the four Sub- \u00a0  TLVs listed below from the Standards Track\" (0-16383) range If this is in fact referencing  RFC9041  then the 0-16383 range is \"Standards Action\" NOT \"Standards Track\"",
