Many thanks to Tim Bray for his ART ART review:  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/art/SKUKjoE9bPh62XsVezoD5mPAkz4/ , and to the authors for addressing Tim's comments. I have one question for consideration (which will not require any textual changes to the document): is \"Standard Track\" the proper track of RFC for this document? I am happy to be told by the authors, working group or responsible AD that yes - this has been discussed and the consensus was that \"Standard Track\" is the most appropriate track for this document. Normally I would look for such information in the shepherd write-up, but unfortunately I can't find my answer there, nor through my superficial archive search. Note I am not questioning the need for this document, which I understand has been discussed and has consensus, barely its track - doesn't this fit better as Informational, or even BCP (although I concur with Murray, BCP does not seem appropriate)?
