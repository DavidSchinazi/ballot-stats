In turn this means that \"returning\" packets are sent to the MPLS/UDP port number.  (*) nobody is listening on that UDP port.  This will cause issues when NATs/firewalls are in-between, as the return traffic, i.e., the traffic incoming from the public part of the NAT, is not matching any NAT binding that was created before by an outgoing packet. Similar for firewalls as no state was created when the packet traversed the firewall.  NATs are probably not a big issue in a carrier net, but firewalls will for sure. I guess this should be mentioned as an operational note.",
