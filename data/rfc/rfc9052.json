These registries do exist, however the registry rules will not be documented in the replacement standards track document that is in force. And if you look at the IANA page for the COSE regsistries ( https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms ), they simply reference back to  RFC 8152  which after approval of this document will be an obsoleted RFC.  Thus, I am of the opinion that the rules for expert review and other registration rules for an IETF created registry should exist in an current in force RFC that is referenced by the registry. Thus, I would propose that the registration rule texts from Section 16 in  RFC 8152  is included in Section 12 of this document and also request the IANA to update the registry references to point to the new document.",
