        "text": "Thank you for this easy-to-read document!\u00a0 The design is pretty elegant, but I think there are a few places that remain insufficiently specified so as to admit interoperable implementation. In particular, I don't think the TTL-handling behavior for the SF Label in the \"label stacking\" case is completely specified, though an apparent typo in Section 7 (see COMMENT) makes it hard to tell what was intended. In Section 8, we see that: \u00a0  When an SFF receives a packet containing an MPLS label stack, it \u00a0  checks whether it is processing an {SFP, SI} label pair for label \u00a0  swapping or a {context label, SFI index} label pair for label \u00a0  stacking. [...] What data source is consulted to make this check?\u00a0 The control plane? Is this distinction made on a per-node basis or a per-packet basis or otherwise?\u00a0 My first thought was that it's per-SFC-Context-Label, but we're not guaranteed that those values will be interpretable equivalently in the swapping or stacking usages, IIUC.
