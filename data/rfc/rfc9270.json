        "text": "Thanks for this document, and sorry for the late discuss, which should hopefully be trivial to fix. \u00a0  Notification (N): 1 bit \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When set to 1, this bit indicates that the control plane message \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 exchange is only used for notification during protection \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 switching.\u00a0 When set to 0 (default), it indicates that the control \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 plane message exchanges are used for protection-switching \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 purposes.\u00a0 The N bit is only applicable when the LSP Protection \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Type Flag is set to 0x04 (1:N Protection with Extra- Traffic), \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0x08 (1+1 Unidirectional Protection), 0x10 (1+1 Bidirectional \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Protection), or 0x20 (Shared Mesh Protection).\u00a0 If 0x20 (SMP), the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 N bit MUST be set to 1.\u00a0 The N bit MUST be set to 0 in any other \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 case. I think that the way that this  RFC4872  text has been updated makes this text unclear/ambiguous. Specifically, I think that somebody could reasonably interpret this as saying that the N bit is set to 1 for SMP, and otherwise it must always be set to 0, but I don't think that is the intention.\u00a0 So please can this be clarified. One fix could be to swap the order of the last 2 sentences.\u00a0 E.g., \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 or 0x20 (Shared Mesh Protection).\u00a0 The N bit MUST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be set to 0 in any other case. If 0x20 (SMP), the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 N bit MUST be set to 1. Alternatively, I think that you could possibly just remove the \"If 0x20 (SMP), the N bit MUST be set to 1.\" and instead rely on the text in 5.2/5.3, (perhaps strengthening with  RFC 2119  language if required).
