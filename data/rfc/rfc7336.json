This security considerations text seems particularly inadequate to me: Another concern that arises in any CDN is that information about the \u00a0  behavior of users (what content they access, how much content they \u00a0  consume, etc.) may be gathered by the CDN.\u00a0 This risk certainly \u00a0  exists in inter-connected CDNs, but it should be possible to apply \u00a0  the same techniques to mitigate it as in the single CDN case. Perhaps this is true, but without further discussion of what the existing techniques are, this seems like a weak claim. Furthermore, there are many aspects of the framework described in this document that implicitly promote better identification of clients to more nodes (interconnected CDNs, recursive DNS resolvers, etc.), so it would be helpful to understand how to square that with the claim made above.",

(1) section 3: I would like to have seen some examples with discussion of DNSSEC and where the URL the client starts with is an HTTPS URL and/or where HTTPS URLs are used between CDNs. I'm not trying to insist on that though but have those (3) issues been considered by the WG?\u00a0 If not, when will they?\u00a0  (2) There is no mention of privacy in this document at all, nor is the CDNi requirement LI-17 mentioned.\u00a0 Isn't there simply missing text on that? If not, why not?\u00a0 For example in 4.4 I was surprised not to see any mention of privacy issues or jurisdiction issues. Why does that not need a mention? Are there really no open issues associated with the LI and privacy? Just to pick on one of the possibly many juicy issues: what if the browser request has DNT set? (I don't expect this doc to resolve that issue btw.)  (3) section 6: Am I right in thinking that this is the first time we're standardising protocols related to CDNs? (That is, we have not prevously standardised any CDNi or CSP/CDN protocols.) If so, then I question whether the \"main trust issue\" is transitive trust. That is an issue certainly, but we are also here standardising the logging that has until now been handled in proprietary ways by CSPs and CDNs, which arguably means that the associated privacy issues for the end user need to be considered as in scope and it is not sufficient to simply say \"do what CDNs do.\" If those are in scope, then I would further argue that that is also a significant trust issue. If we figure out how to handle discuss point 2 above, then this might just amount to a simple reference to whatever text results (or maybe that text would just go in this section.) (4) 4.7: Just checking: This made me wonder about how CDNI and HTTP/2.0 are intended to play together. I think there's been relevant discussion on httpbis about similar issues but haven't followed that. Is someone tracking how CDNI and HTTP/2.0 will interact? If not then wouldn't that be a good idea since both are likely to arrive as RFCs about the same time?\u00a0 (To be clear: I've no strong opinion on the details here, nor on sequencing of outputs, but would just like to know we don't have two WGs ignoring one another when they shouldn't. And I'll happily hand this discuss point over to someone who knows more about both topics.)",
