        "text": "This relates to Benoit's comment.\u00a0  I think the reason Benoit is confused is that this document doesn't clearly specify its scope, and if I am correct this should be easy to fix.\u00a0  As it is currently written, the document can be read in two different ways.\u00a0  The first way, which I _think_ is what is intended, is that the 3GPP node sets up a Wifi LAN of its own, with its own SSID, and manages that link as the sole router.\u00a0  The second way it can be read is that the 3GPP node joins an existing WiFi LAN and starts advertising a prefix on it. Both scenarios are useful, but the second one is harder to specify, and the current document is inadequate to the task, as Benoit has observed.\u00a0  But if I am right that the first scenario is the only one that this document intends to support, I think the document is fine as is.\u00a0  So the easy way to address this DISCUSS is to add a scoping statement in the introduction: OLD: \u00a0  3GPP mobile cellular networks such as GSM, UMTS, and LTE have \u00a0  architectural support for IPv6 [ RFC6459 ] , but only 3GPP Release-10 \u00a0  and onwards of the 3GPP specification supports DHCPv6 Prefix \u00a0  Delegation [ RFC3633 ] for delegating IPv6 prefixes to a single LAN \u00a0  link.\u00a0 To facilitate the use of IPv6 in a LAN prior to the deployment \u00a0  of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in 3GPP networks and in User Equipment \u00a0  (UE), this document describes requirements and provides examples on \u00a0  how the 3GPP UE radio interface assigned global /64 prefix may be \u00a0  extended from the 3GPP radio interface to a LAN link.\u00a0  NEW: \u00a0  3GPP mobile cellular networks such as GSM, UMTS, and LTE have \u00a0  architectural support for IPv6 [ RFC6459 ] , but only 3GPP Release-10 \u00a0  and onwards of the 3GPP specification supports DHCPv6 Prefix \u00a0  Delegation [ RFC3633 ] for delegating IPv6 prefixes to a single LAN \u00a0  link.\u00a0  \u00a0  To facilitate the use of IPv6 in a LAN prior to the deployment \u00a0  of DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in 3GPP networks and in User Equipment \u00a0  (UE), this document describes requirements and provides examples on \u00a0  how the 3GPP UE radio interface assigned global /64 prefix may be \u00a0  extended from the 3GPP radio interface to a LAN link.\u00a0  \u00a0  There are two scenarios where this might be done.\u00a0  The first \u00a0  is where the 3GPP node sets up and manages its own LAN \u00a0  (e.g., an IEEE 802.11 SSID) and provides single-homed service \u00a0  to hosts that connect to this LAN.\u00a0  A second scenario is where \u00a0  the 3GPP node connects to an existing LAN and acts as a \u00a0  router in order to provide redundant or multi-homed IPv6 service. \u00a0  This document is intended to address the first scenario, and is \u00a0  not applicable to the second scenario, because the operational \u00a0  complexities of the second scenario are not addressed. Or something like that.\u00a0  Anyway, assuming that I'm correct in understanding where this document is intended to be used, I think a quick update will resolve this DISCUSS.\u00a0  If the document is intended to cover the second scenario, it's not ready for publication and will require substantial additional work, for the reasons Benoit has already stated.",
