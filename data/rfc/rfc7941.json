You say: (1) \"In RTP sessions where any type of confidentiality protection is enabled for RTCP, the SDES item header extensions MUST also be protected.\" And then you say: (2) \"The security level that is applied to RTCP packets carrying SDES items SHOULD also be applied to SDES items carried as RTP header extensions.\"  My concerns are that the SHOULD in (2) isn't really well motivated (for me) - you just seem to say that someone who doesn't follow the SHOULD has to say why, but I don't think that's likely a run-time concept.\u00a0 Secondly, (1) doesn't say that the new stuff has to be protected in the same way, e.g. with the same endpoints having the keys, and not e.g. where the RTCP data has e2e protection but the new header field just has hop-by-hop protection. Are my concerns justified? (If not, that's fine you'll tell me and we're done:-)  If these are justified concerns, I think we can easily get around them by (a) closing that potential loophole in (1) and (b) s/SHOULD/MUST/ in (2) or else (c) better specify an exception to the SHOULD that makes sense at coding time or at run time.",
