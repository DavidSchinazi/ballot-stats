The input domain to the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 discovery algorithm SHALL be the domain \"part\" ([ RFC5322 ]) of the email \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 address that is being certified. And  RFC 8659  states: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The search for a CAA RRset climbs the DNS name tree from the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 specified label up to, but not including, the DNS root \".\" until \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 a CAA RRset is found. While this algorithm makes sense for a CAA to restrict issuing, I'm not sure it makes sense for email addresses where the permission might be granted by a parent. eg ig there is a CAA record saying \"no email certs\" at  nohats.ca , and there is a CAA record saying \"sure, issue stuff\" at  toronto.nohats.ca , is it the desired behaviour that  toronto.nohats.ca  can override the  nohats.ca policy and issues certs for  paul@toronto.nohats.ca ?\u00a0 This also brings into question whether Public Suffix List (PSL) type restrains matter. It might very well be the intent, but then perhaps it should be made a little more explicit ? (and then I have to rethink about what I think about subdomains overriding their parents) Issue #2: Section 5.4 contains an example of conflicting records, and the text then describes a process of \"failing open\". From a security point of view, I would argue this should \"fail close\" and not allow issuance. Was this discussed in the WG? What is the rationale behind this \"more vulnerable to mistakes\" interpretation?",
