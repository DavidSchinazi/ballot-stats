        "text": "I support the idea of this document. It could provide useful guidance, especially to newcomers to BGP operations. However, I have some issues I would like to see resolved or at least discussed before the document advances. The Routing Directorate review from Geoff Huston received a somewhat peremptory response form the authors more concerned with the nature and timing of the review than with the technical issues raised. The authors specifically asked for ADs to tell them how to proceed and, since the review came after the end of IETF last call so I am adopting those  issues that I consider important as part of this Discuss (although I would be very happy if you addressed them all). --- Section 5.1 talks about GTSM, but does not discuss what to do when there is more than one IP hop between BGP speakers. It would be perfectly fine to explicitly state that this mechanism can only apply to single-hop BGP sessions such as those between adjacent ASBRs.  Section 5.1. also talks about IPSEC, but as Geoff Huston observed, while the use of IPSEC has been documented as a possible BGP transport there  is very little deployment experience and reasons have been suggested why this would expose the router to further forms of denial of service  attack because of the workload in decrypting incoming IPSEC packets.  Maybe the thing to do is either strike the sentence or add a caveat that further analysis might be needed. --- Unless I missed it, the document doesn't talk about compromised routers and bad actors (perhaps some slight discussion in the SIDR section?).  We normally talk about compromised IGP routers and how they are hard to protect against, but the issues are somewhat different in BGP speakers because of what they can do across the whole Internet, and how the compromise can be in something like a Route Reflector that may be a  server rather than a dedicated hardware router. Furthermore, the actions of a bad actor can be intended to do far more than simply break things. I don't believe this would be a hard topic to address, but it also has knock-on effects on the efficacy of some of the security mechanisms suggested and (maybe) makes SIDR more pressing. --- Section 6.1.4 \u00a0  A network SHOULD filter its own prefixes on peerings with all its \u00a0  peers (inbound direction). Geoff notes \u00a0  This requires a lot more \u00a0  thought, particularly relating to multi-homed \u00a0  networks that do not use a dedicated ASN. One \u00a0  party's leak is another party's form of traffic \u00a0  engineering. I don't think this needs a lot of work, just a qualification of the type of peering where this recommendation applies. --- In Section 11 \u00a0  In particular do not \u00a0  (generally) remove the no-export community as it is usually \u00a0  announced by your peer for a certain purpose. As Geoff says, this seems in conflict with the normal processing rules for a No-Export community. --- And two final Discuss points from me... I have no objection to the use of  RFC 2119  language in a BCP and I think it is OK to pitch this document as a BCP, but I am confused as to the use of \"MUST\" in conjunction with the text in Section 2 \u00a0  Nature of the Internet is such that Autonomous Systems \u00a0  can always agree on exceptions for relevant local needs, and \u00a0  therefore configure rules which may differ from the recommendations \u00a0  provided in this document. So I think that the document is making recommendations, and that you  need to limit yourself to \"SHOULD\" although it would be more in keeping to use \"RECOMMENDED\". Although in section 9 you have \"This section is listing rules that apply to BGP AS-paths\" followed by some uses of \"SHOULD\". Perhaps, \"This section lists the RECOMMENDED practices when processing BGP AS-paths\" --- 6.1.2.4 makes the apparent statement that  RFC 6480  includes BGPsec in  its infrastructure. I think it is fine to include BGPsec in this section (or maybe a closely-related section), but you probably shouldn't say it is directly derived from 6480.",
