        "text": "Overall the draft is very good, thank you for writing it.\u00a0 I just wanted to discuss some of the security/privacy considerations and see if we could improve the language and make sure the set of concerns are clear. The privacy consideration section reads more like possible attack scenarios that would fit into the security considerations.\u00a0 What privacy related concerns result from these attacks?\u00a0 Having that spelled out to differentiate the risks as privacy only would be helpful (if appropriate) or moving this into the security consideration section *IF* it is more generically applicable.\u00a0 If I am missing something and this is only privacy related, it would be good to understand that in this discussion.\u00a0  Adding some text on how these attacks could be used to expose privacy related information would be helpful too. For the first example, it seems it is the possibility that a report goes outside out the intended scope is the concern.\u00a0 The mitigation seems to be provided in the last sentence of #4, but couldn't this be other information leakage and not just privacy?\u00a0 Let me know if I am missing something that explains why this is privacy specific. In #3 of the second example, the last sentence includes the following clause: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and giving some UAs no \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Valid Pinning Header for other subdomains (causing subsequent \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 requests for  m.fingerprint.example.com  to succeed). Does this mean that these subdomains are succeeding when they should fail?\u00a0 It might just be me, but that is not clear in the text (or if they are supposed to succeed).\u00a0 It sounds like they are not supposed to succeed and this is the security issue.\u00a0 How is this privacy specific?\u00a0 Again, this may just be me, but an explanation would be helpful. In the last sentence of the privacy considerations section, what is meant by the description \"forensic attacker\"?\u00a0 I find this term confusing.\u00a0 Was this intended to mean that techniques used in forensic analysis could be used by an attacker to discern information that could be of interest?\u00a0 If that's the case, I think it would be clearer to the reader if that were stated instead.",

The scenario would be that the government has a transparent web cache in the path between the host and the UA, and the web cache pins false cert for hosts that are being censored.\u00a0  Now even if the user sets up a tunnel to bypass the transparent cache, they can't access the censored site, so they conclude that the site is down and abandon the tunnel.\u00a0  I could easily see this being used in a scenario like the recent DNS censorship in Turkey. Setting a lower maximum pin age mitigates the damage of such attacks if the user keeps the tunnel up for the duration of the pin, but I don't think it's realistic to assume that they will.\u00a0  I think that the only way to mitigate this attack is to have a mechanism whereby conflicting DANE TLSA information overrides the pin.\u00a0  This would allow a site being attacked in this way to securely inform the UA that the pin was invalid.\u00a0  The government could of course prevent DNSSEC validation, but the UA could take this as another signal to drop the pin: if the zone where the TLSA record should be fails to validate (as opposed to isn't signed, which wouldn't signify anything), the pin is likely a censorship attempt.",
