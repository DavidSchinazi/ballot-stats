I have a blocking issue that should be easy to resolve, and a handful of more minor issues. \u00a72.1: >\u00a0 The client makes a token exchange request to the token endpoint with >\u00a0 an extension grant type by including the following parameters using >\u00a0 the \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" format This document needs a normative citation for this media type. My suggestion would be to cite REC-html5-20141028 section 4.10.22.6, as this appears to be the most recent stable description of how to encode this media type. I'd love to hear rationale behind other citations being more appropriate, since I'm not entirely happy with the one I suggest above (given that it's been superseded by HTML 5.2); but every other plausible citation I can find is even less palatable (with HTML 5.2 itself having the drawback of not actually defining how to encode the media type, instead pointing to an unstable, unversioned document).",
