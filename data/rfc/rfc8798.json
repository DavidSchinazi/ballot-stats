        "text": "I have some questions and comments about the text below, which seems like it creates significant scope for interoperability failures: \"Where the benefits of directly using a secondary unit in a SenML pack \u00a0  outweigh the above considerations, the use of secondary units in \"u\" \u00a0  fields MAY be enabled by indicating a new SenML version that \u00a0  specifically allows this and/or by using a field with a label name \u00a0  that ends with the \"_\" character (\"must-understand\" field) whose \u00a0  definition specifically allows this.\u00a0 The definition of these \u00a0  versions and fields is outside the scope of the present \u00a0  specification; one such definition is proposed in \u00a0  [ I-D.bormann-core-senml-versions ].\" Do I understand correctly that this allows secondary units in (1) SenML packs that use some version number besides 10, and (2) SenML fields named with \"_\" that are in packs where the version number is 10? What is the motivation for providing two different mechanisms to signal that secondary units are in use? I.e., why isn't one or the other of these mechanisms sufficient? Without defining either a new version that supports secondary units or fields with \"_\", I don't understand how this update to  RFC 8428  is complete enough to be implementable. It says other versions and fields are out of scope, but don't some need to be defined in order for the normative MAY in this text to be actionable?  The label names registry policy is Expert Review, which does not require formal documentation of the registry entry. Where is the \"definition [that] specifically allows this\" expected to occur? Presumably some implementations are already using SenML. What is an implementation supposed to do if it encounters a label name containing \"_\" that it does not understand in a version 10 pack? It looks like this text went in a week ago but it's a pretty significant change to the extensibility story for SenML, so I'm wondering if the WG had a chance to come to consensus on it? I'm not super familiar with SenML so apologies if the answers to some of these questions are obvious.",
