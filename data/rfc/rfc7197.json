Anyway, the discuss is: has someone looked at how this might interact with security for media?\u00a0 For example, did anyone think about whether this kind of duplication could give an attacker who could manipulate the SDP but not the media an advantage since that attacker could affect the plaintext in deterministic ways. Or if SDES is used with a human memorable string as a key and if the media were essentially random, then this would give a dictionary attacker a nice quick way to verify guesses of the key. I'm not sure what security considerations text ought be added though, since you'd want someone who's much more familiar with SRTP options etc.\u00a0 to have done that analysis first.

Having thought about this a bit more, I don't expect its really feasible to  get a full analysis done here since this mechanism might only badly interact with cryptograpic schemes that are already somewhat weak. So I suggest  adding 2 chunks of text such as those below  to the security considerations section. Note: I'm more confident of the language for chunk#1, please sanity-check chunk#2 before you include it with someone who knows a bit more about SDES. Chunk#1: \"Since this mechanism causes duplication of media packets, if those packets are also  cryptographically protected, (e.g. encrypted) then such duplication could act as an accelerator  if any million-message [ RFC 3218 ] or similar [Lucky13] attack exists against the security  mechanism that is in use. Such acceleration  could turn an otherwise infeasible attack into  one that is practical, however, assuming that  the amount of duplication is small and that  such weak or broken security mechanisms should really not be used, the overall security impact of the duplication should be minimal. If however, a bad-actor were in control of the SDP but did not have access to the keying material used for media, then  such a bad actor could potentially use the SDP to cause the media handling to use a weak or broken mechanism with a lot of duplication, in which case the  duplication could be significant. Deployments  where the SDP is controlled by an actor  who shouldn't have access to the  media keying-material should therefore  be cautious in their use of this  duplication mechanism.\" Chunk#2 \"If this mechanism were used in  conjunction with SDES and if the key being used for media protection is derived from a human-memorable or otherwise dictionary-attackable secret, then the duplication done  here could allow for a more efficient dictionary attack against the media. The right countermeasure is to use proper keying, or if using SDES to ensure that the keys used are not dictionary-attackable.\"",
