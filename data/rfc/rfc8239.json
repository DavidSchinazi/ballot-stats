I think the only point is that these tests are especially important to run for data center equipment but that doesn't change the fact that the test itself are not specific for data center equipment. The reason why it's a discuss this time, is that I further really don't understand why existing tests have to be specified again is this document even though a test for that case already exists that specifies exactly the same thing in another RFC; I'm talking about Section 5 on Head of Line Blocking that specifies the same test as in section 5.5 of  RFC2889  (there called Congestion Control which a confusing term because this doesn't address end-to-end congestion control, anyway...).
