This text doesn't seem very clear. When you say \"never overflows a digit boundary\" do you mean \"doesn't extend the integer to the left\"? Because you sure seem to be overflowing the 1s place here.  Is the algorithm that you are given the input TN, Count, and TN consists D digits that the range is: \u00a0 MIN(TN + Count, 10^D - 1) That would be consistent with your example here, but I don't think consistent with your text.

(3) section 9: you need to say whether this extension needs to be or can be critical and where in the cert path it's allowed to be and how to interpret things if >1 cert in the path has this extension (if that's allowed, and if it is, then complexity awaits us;-). (4) section 10: you need to pick one MTI method I think. Why is that wrong? You nearly, but not quite, do. Why not just do it? (5) section 10: don't you need to somehow define \"short-lived\"? That could be defined as an RP-configurable value, but even if so, I think you need to say that. Even if you do that, I'm not sure that an RP-configured value is right as short-lived certs, vs. not, puts a different burden on the signer and if the signer and RP have different ideas of what short-lived means, then interop failures seem likely.
