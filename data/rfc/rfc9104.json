I think that it would be helpful for this document to explicitly state how this attribute behaves in conjunction with the existing Administrative Group (color) TLV (1088).\u00a0 E.g., is the expectation that if this attribute is published then the 1088 attribute would also always be published (with the same first 32 bits)?\u00a0 Or is the expectation that this attribute can be published without the 1088 attribute being published at all? Similarly, if a client receives both attributes there are there any expectations to how it handles those, i.e., should it always use the new attribute in preference?\u00a0 Or otherwise, what should it do if the values were inconsistent between the two attributes?
