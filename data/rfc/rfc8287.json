        "text": "Section 5.3 indicates that \"Advertising Node Identifier\" and \"Receiving Node Identifier\" are \"4 or 6 octets.\" There are two issues that arise with the way this is currently specified, both of which can lead to a lack of interoperability: 1. While implementors might infer that \"Protocol=1\" results in a 4-byte value, and that \"Protocol=2\" results in a 6-byte value, it's a bit unclear what length is to be used here for \"Protocol=0.\" 2. The descriptions for both of these fields include: \"When Protocol is set to 1, then the 32 rightmost bits represent OSPF Router ID.\"\u00a0 This implies that the field is *wider* than 32 bits when Protocol=1, which leaves deep ambiguity about the circumstances under which the field is allowed to be 4 octets. I would strongly recommend that this section add clear language that unambiguously spells out how implementations are expected to select the field width for the four variable-width fields in this Sub-TLV (the two I cite above as well as the interface ID fields).",
