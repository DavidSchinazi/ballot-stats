        "text": "ISSUE 1 The security situation here is pretty unspecified here, in at least two respects: 1. In terms of communication security, you seem to have two modes: \u00a0  (a) Punt it to ACP \u00a0  (b) Use TLS as specified in S 3.5.2.1 I'm not reviewing ACP here (though I have some comments on that too) but S 3.5.2.1 doesn't (for) instance explain how to do certificate validation, which it clearly needs to do. Finally, I don't understand the security story for the multicast packets. This is especially relevant for Rapid mode, where you are attaching real work to these multicast packets. 2. I didn't find the security model very clear. As I understand things, basically anyone on the network who has ACP credentials is trusted to engage in negotiation with you, so, for instance, if you want to get parameter X, then you basically just trust whoever on the network offers you X. is that correct? That seems like it needs to be very explicitly called out. And if that's not true, then I don't understand the spec. ISSUE 2 This document seems like it provides incomplete guidance on how to actually implement it. For instance: \u00a0  discovery messages to a reasonable value, in order to mitigate \u00a0  possible denial of service attacks.\u00a0 It MUST cache the Session ID \u00a0  value and initiator address of each relayed Discovery message until What's \"reasonable\"? ISSUE 3. I don't think I understand how the transition from UDP multicast to TCP/TLS unicast works. Maybe I'm just misreading the spec, so could you point me to the section that describes this. Finally, I don't see a spec for how you map CBOR onto the wire. Do you just shove them on? Something else? I see that Martin Thomson raised a number of these issues in his review in more detail.",

Every usage of UDP is required by IETF consensus to review  RFC 8085  and to address at least the applicable subset of issues listed in  RFC 8085  (or the predecessor  RFC 5405 ). * Starting with UDP and switching to TCP for the data transfer looks like the right do. However, UDP should be really only used to discover other devices, but not piggy back further protocol mechanics. However, this document is not really specific on how to make use of TCP, for instance, how long are TCP connections kept open or closed down after a protocol exchange (persistent vs temporary connections). What happens if a TCP connection is shutdown by one end or is forcefully closed, e.g., by a reset?\" I would recommend, as assumed in the rest of the document, to update section 3.5.3 to only use UDP for the initial recovery message and open a TCP connection for the discovery response and require that all other messages to be sent over TCP (also removing any option to use any other reliable transport because TCP seems to be the right choice here.) Further, additional guidance is needed when to open and close a TCP connection (or keep it alive for later use) and what to do if the connection is interrupted. 2) Time-out handling section 3.5.4.4: \"Since the relay device is unaware of the timeout set by the original \u00a0  initiator it SHOULD set a timeout at least equal to GRASP_DEF_TIMEOUT \u00a0  milliseconds.\" Should a relay really maintain an own time-out?
