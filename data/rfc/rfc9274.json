In  RFC 7285 , cost-mode is defined as a field that MUST take one of two string values, either \"numerical\" or \"ordinal\".\u00a0 I'm not really familiar with  RFC 7285 , and in particular, whether a receiver is required to explicitly check that the received data must take one of these two values, or whether a reasonable implementation could check for a single value, and if doesn't match that value assume that it must be the other value (since there are only two allowed values).\u00a0 Obviously, moving to more than two values could then cause this assumption to break in existing implementations.\u00a0 Was this issue considered and discussed by the WG?\u00a0 It looks like alto does support a versioning mechanism (i.e., by defining new media types) that might allow the definition of this field to be upgraded in a safer way.\u00a0 Was that approach considered?
