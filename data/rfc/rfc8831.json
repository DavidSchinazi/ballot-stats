Multiple simultaneous data channels from different \"modes\" (unreliable, partially or fully reliable), or even from the same mode? \"modes\" in double quotes, because, if I recall correctly SCTP delivery mode is per message, not per stream. However, I don't have a better word. Then I started to wonder...\u00a0 I've see those requirements before.  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements-14 \u00a0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a0  F22\u00a0 \u00a0  The browser must be able to receive streams and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  data from multiple peers concurrently. \u00a0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- So I should not be commenting on the requirements again! Why do you repeat, with different wording, the use cases and requirements in this document? Note that this document contains  RFC 2119  keywords for the requirements, while  draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements  doesn't.  Does it imply the requirements in this document are more important? This is confusing.  Disclaimer: I have not done a 1:1 comparison of the requirements in both documents. A discrepancy would be another DISCUSS reason. Referring to  draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements  is the way to go. Even if [ I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements ] is an informative reference, progressing this draft while [ I-D.ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements ] still has issues is not appropriate. I'll trust the responsible AD on that. Ah, I just realized that Pete has got a similar feedback.",
