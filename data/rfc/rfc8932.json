Do we need to delay processing this document until 7626bis has settled down and it is clear what content we can refer to in that vs. needing to incorporate into this document?\u00a0 (It's unclear that such content would be less controversial in this document than in that one.) Specifically, Section 5.1.2 of this document refers to Section 2.5.3 of that document (\"Rogue Servers\"). [new discuss point] This is perhaps more a flaw in  RFC 8310  than in this document, but I'd still like to discuss it: in Section 5.1.2 we read that: \u00a0  When using DNS-over-TLS clients that select a 'Strict Privacy' usage \u00a0  profile [ RFC8310 ] (to mitigate the threat of active attack on the \u00a0  client) require the ability to authenticate the DNS server.\u00a0 To \u00a0  enable this, DNS privacy services that offer DNS-over-TLS should \u00a0  provide credentials in the form of either X.509 certificates \u00a0  [ RFC5280 ] or Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) pin sets [ RFC8310 ]. Authenticating the DoT server via X.509 certificate as described here and in RFC 8310  seesm to involve looking for an ADN in the certificate; however, I could not find any discussion of how to know what CA(s) or trust anchors to trust to certify the ADN in a certificate.\u00a0 It's possible that  RFC 8310 's use of \"PKIX Certificate\" is supposed to imply that Web PKI trust anchors are used, but that's not immediately clear.\u00a0 It may be the case that we need to mention provisioning a trust anchor as well as the X.509 certificate information, here.",
