        "text": "First off, thanks for the work on this document; it's important to get this behavior clarified and functional even for NFSv4.0. That said, this document (along with the pieces of 7530 and 7931 that I read along the way) still leave me uncertain about how some things are supposed to work.\u00a0 (If it's clarified in parts of those documents that I didn't read, I'll happily clear and apologize for the disruption, of course.) To start with, I'm still lacking a clear high-level picture of why a client needs to care about trunking detection vs. just treating all listed addresses as replicas.\u00a0 There are some parts in the body where we talk about, e.g., lock state and similar maintenance, but I don't have a clear picture of what the risks and benefits of (not) tracking trunking are, and this would be a fine opportunity to add some text.\u00a0 Specifically, in Section 5.2.1, we just say that \"[a] client may use file system location elements simultaneously to provide higher-performance access to the target file system\"; most of the focus of this document makes me think that this statement was intended to apply only to trunking, but I also think there are supposed to be replication-only scenarios that provide performance gains.\u00a0 I'm not sure if we need to clarify the distinction in that location as well as the high-level overview. It's also unclear to me what parts of migration flows are under the control of the client vs. the server.\u00a0 It's clear that the server has to initiate migration via NFS4ERR_MOVED, but my current understanding is just that this prompts the client to look at fs_locations, and the client has control over which alternate location to move to.\u00a0 But there's also a lot of discussion in all three documents about the servers migrating state along with migration, so it seems like the server should be controlling where the client goes.\u00a0 Is this just supposed to be by limiting the fs_locations data to the specific migration target chosen by the server?\u00a0 (If so, this would probably have potential for poor interaction with the implicit filesystem discovery described in Section 5.3.)\u00a0 On the other hand, Section 5.2.6 talks about the server putting entries \"that represent addresses usable with the current server or a migration target before those associated with replicas\", which seems to imply that there is some other way to know what the migration target is. Section 5.2.6 also tells the client to rely on that ordering: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  To keep this process as short as \u00a0  possible, Servers are REQUIRED to place file system location entries \u00a0  that represent addresses usable with the current server or a \u00a0  migration target before those associated with replicas.\u00a0 A client can \u00a0  then cease scanning for trunkable file system location entries once \u00a0  it encounters a file system location element whose fs_name differs but I don't think a client actually can do so, since the client has no way to know that the server implements this document as opposed to stock 7530+7931 (at least, no way that I saw). Finally, removing the last paragraph of Section 8.5 of  RFC 7530  could have negative operational impact if updated clients interact with non-updated servers/environments that are misconfigured in the described fashion.\u00a0 It's probably worth stating in the top-level Section 5 that such misconfigured servers are believed to no longer exist (if that's in fact true, of course; if not, we'd need to reconsider the change).",
