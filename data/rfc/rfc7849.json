I will either update the Discuss to show the appropriate actions, or will remove it. It is clear to me that a number of people working across a broad set of network operators have driven this work, and also that there is consensus in the WG as reported by the chairs. Also I see the consensus called by the AD for IETF last call. The document doesn't use  RFC 2119  language (although the first paragraph of Section 1.3 was a surprise to me, if just weird IMHO, and would probably best be removed). But I agree that it is unfortunate to have developed this document in isolation from 3GPP. That is not to say that the IETF should not publish such a document. But to do so without even notifying 3GPP of the work in progress and giving them the chance to comment seems to be regrettable. While it is clear that there is a perceived need for a profile that is different from what the 3GPP previously developed, it would have been good to hear from 3GPP what concerns they have with this new profiles.",

The following was sent to me from one of the authors: I can eventually understand the resistance to see a profile document published, but I thought this first sentence from the draft would softened that: \u00a0  This document defines an IPv6 profile that a number of operators \u00a0  recommend in order to connect 3GPP mobile devices to an IPv6-only or \u00a0  dual-stack wireless network (including 3GPP cellular network and IEEE \u00a0  802.11 network). The above text clearly illustrates why this document is a problem.\u00a0 How broad is this \"number of operators\"?\u00a0 Does it go beyond the 4 operators listed as document authors?\u00a0 If a vendor implements this profile, will they be capable of operating on a 3G/4G/WLAN network managed by some other operator?\u00a0 As Adrian noted, the convoluted use of 2119 keywords is troubling and having them couched in an Informational profile document is dubious at best. I support Adrian's notion that 3GPP should at least be notified of this work formally.\u00a0 The previous work, like  RFC 3314 , was driven by a partnership between 3GPP and the IETF ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/documents/LIAISON/file725.txt ) and we should continue that partnership *if* the consensus is to publish this document as a consensus-based RFC. It is also unclear if the people who raised earlier concerns feel that their concerns were addressed.\u00a0 I spoke with several of them and they do not think their concerns were addressed, but were tired of fighting over fundamental differences. If a group of operators wants to document a profile that highlights what they want vendors to implement, that should be documented somewhere else besides the IETF. At best, I could see this documented as an ISE document (with all the appropriate warnings).",

This draft portrays itself as a viable alternative product profile to  RFC 7066 . This document should clearly state that the profile described in this document is a super set of the one defined in 7066. 2. The use of 2119 keywords should be stricken from the document. Their use (regardless of their capitalization) leads to confusion as to whether these are recommendations or requirements. 3. The recommendations in this draft are overly broad. It suffers from some of the problems that led to the re-publication of the IPv6 Node Requirements document, namely trying to provide guidance/requirements that go beyond the base specifications being referenced. Justification needs to be documented for functions that go above and beyond those described in 7066. 4. Given that this document is aimed at devices intended for use in 3GPP networks, 3GPP should be made aware of this work in order to facilitate collaboration on its development. This is a task for the WG chairs and sponsoring AD to work with our 3GPP liaison manager. 5. The addition of extended functionality will need to consider the implications for interoperability with legacy systems developed using  RFC 7066 . Consideration, guidance, or caveats need to be documented for interoperability issues.",

        "text": "I'm speaking mostly as an author of RFCs 3316 and 7066 and as a long-term contributor in these discussions. I am not raising a discuss, because Brian is already raising one. And one could perhaps argue that I should not be officially involved in a matter where I have been someone who has argued for particular direction in this space. Hence you should take these as comments only. I think a document in this space would be useful. Potentially very useful for IPv6 deployment. I think we desperately need a document! Unfortunately, we are not quite there with this document. Even if the document has a lot of excellent material. I think the issue is in part the way that the document has been written, partially how it is handled, part is about interoperability, and in part fundamental. As an example of the writing issues, the draft presents itself as a different profile. Casting the document as additional requirements on top of the existing very basic profile (7066) might be a better way to approach the situation. And this is not merely a piece of text to add to the front, the document should actually be structured so that the reader understands what is being added. Secondly, coordination with others who do things in this space would be necessary, i.e., 3GPP. Or at the very least, the document should be clear what its role is. The document could have been called \"Extended IPv6 Profile for Mobile Devices in Foo, Bar, Snaap Operator Networks\", and make it clear that it builds on 3GPP/IETF specifications but adds more functionality to deal with additional situations. Then it would have been a great contribution to make the case that these operators believe they can and should address those additional situations. And there'd be no confusion about what the role of the document is. Thirdly, I think we at IETF should care about interoperability. Brian already said it, but we should not create a fork. That would be bad for everyone. This part clearly needs more work. Some of the additional functions are fine; but I do not have a good understanding of what the rest of the text means for interoperability with existing devices, for instance. Finally, there are some fundamental differences to what has been done before or in 3GPP, like the specification of additional transition mechanisms. While I personally have disagreed with some of those choices in the past, I recognise that I have have been in the rough on this (at least in the IETF, not sure about elsewhere). In any case, with a proper scope for suggested additional requirements in some networks, this would be fine. (I wish I had the time to look at this document earlier. Sorry. All this input at the last moment feels bad. But we may also be repeating some of the discussions we had in V6OPS at the time that we wrote 7066.)",
