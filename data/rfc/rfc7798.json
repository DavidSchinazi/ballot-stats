For a 99 page specification of a highly non-trivial encoding scheme, I would have expected to see the results of a better analysis. Was that analysis done? That should at least include consideration of the CVEs already published relating to H.264 [1] which include 34 CVEs relating to various kinds of remote-code-execution and DoS. If the authors here are asserting that this presumably more complex codec will have few vulnerabilities, then I would welcome seeing the justification for that statement. (Note: In some cases with payload drafts, authors can fairly claim that the I-D does not describe the payload in detail and hence that the security considerations text need not be comprehensive as implementers are expected to find that elsewhere. In this case, the 99 pages strongly argues otherwise IMO - there are plenty of ways to go badly wrong implementing what is stated in this draft.) To summarise: \"MUST exercise caution\" is not useful, can't you translate that into actionable advice to an implementer based on experience with security issues found with this and similar codecs? \u00a0  [1]  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=h.264 (2) This is just a process nit probably. The shepherd write-up doesn't mention the Nokia IPR declaration.\u00a0 Were the WG also ok with that one? The write-up seems to pre-date that latest IPR declaration, which is from a company that seems to employ one of the authors. That is odd timing really so can someone explain the sequence of events and why all is well?",
