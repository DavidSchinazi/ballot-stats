If all of the parameters listed in Section 3.3 (assuming they apply) are configured and documented, is it assumed that the benchmarks will be repeatable and comparable with hardware implementation benchmarks? Or is the position of the document that the benchmarks are not likely to be repeatable/comparable in some (many?) cases, given the increase in complexity? Or that more work needs to be done (outside the specification process) to achieve repeatability? I think this needs to be more clear in the document.",
