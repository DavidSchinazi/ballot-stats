Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points (very easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education). Other thanks to Carlos Bernardos, the Internet directorate reviewer (at my request), please consider this int-dir review: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-sfc-multi-layer-oam-26-intdir-telechat-bernardos-2023-06-28/  (and I have read Greg's reply, still waiting for a revised I-D though) Special thanks to Don Eastlake for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus and the justification of the intended status and the author counts.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric # DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Section 6 As there two V header fields defined (one for Echo message and one for all OAM messages), it is unclear whether the Echo V-field is set back to 0 when SFC OAM header Version is incremented? Or in other words, should Echo with V=0 but with OAM V != 0 be interpreted as specified in this document ? Are the TLV type depending on the Version being 0 ?",
