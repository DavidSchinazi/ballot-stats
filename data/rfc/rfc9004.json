The proposed change is: > I clarified: > The duration of the trial MUST include least 2 seconds in addition to the time > required to send and receive each burst of frames, to ensure that DUT buffers to > deplete. >  > and I'll add: > The upper search limit for the time to send each burst MUST be configurable as > high as 30 seconds (buffer time results reported at the configured upper limit are > likely invalid, and the test MUST be repeated with a higher search limit). But IIUC it's the additional time that needs to scale up. A layman's reading of the document, IMO, suggests that the burst length has a binary search but the 2 seconds of waiting can be fixed.",
