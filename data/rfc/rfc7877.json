These are all listed as informative references.\u00a0 If you use terminology defined elsewhere, those references (3261 and 5486) need to be normative (they're required in order to understand the terms used in this doument). -- Section 4.11 -- \u00a0  At the time of this writing, a choice of transport protocol has been \u00a0  provided in SPP Protocol over SOAP document. This would be a good place for a reference to that draft.\u00a0 I think the reference is important, as you've made it MTI; I think it's a normative one.\u00a0 I don't think \"At the time of this writing\" is necessary, though if you really like it I don't object.\u00a0 It's also missing a \"the\" and some quotes, as thus: NEW \u00a0  One choice of transport protocol has been provided in the document \u00a0  \"SPP Protocol over SOAP\" [reference]. END -- Section 11.2 -- Why does the policy need to be RFC Required?\u00a0 Why not Expert Review?\u00a0 For that matter, why not FCFS?\u00a0 You can either point me at mailing list archives where this was discussed, or explain the necessity in response to this comment. While we're talking about OrgIdType, I don't think the document makes it clear what this is, and why new ones would be registered in the first place.\u00a0 Why would we ever need an OrgIdType Namespace other than \"iana-en\"?\u00a0 Shouldn't the document say something about that?",
