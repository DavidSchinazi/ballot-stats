I intend to ballot \"yes,\" once the following issue has been resolved: This document defines three modes: \"enforce\", \"testing\", and \"none\". It is intended to work in conjunction with  draft-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt , which shows the use of \"mode: report\" in all of its examples. On a quick survey of hosts I can quickly find publishing MTA-STS records, I find: version: STSv1 mode: testing mx:  aspmx.l.google.com mx: .aspmx.l.google.com max_age: 86400 version: STSv1 mode: report mx:  mx00.emig.gmx.net mx:  mx01.emig.gmx.net max_age: 604800 version: STSv1 mode: report mx:  mx1.comcast.net mx:  mx2.comcast.net max_age: 2592000 version: STSv1 mode: report mx: *.am0.yahoodns.net max_age: 86400 The implementation confusion here appears to be real.

This doesn't seem like quite what you want.
