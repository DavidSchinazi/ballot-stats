All of section 3, 4, and 5 (except maybe 4.5 and 4.6) is common for IPv4 and IPv6, right? It's only when I arrived at section 6 that I somehow understood. I should have paid more attention to the table of content. Proposal: the introduction could introduce a sentence or two, with a forward reference to section 6. However, I was wondering \"There is surely a RFC for DHCPv4 failover!\", but I could not find anything, except an old draft  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dhc-failover-12 . Slightly confused, should be missing something ...",
