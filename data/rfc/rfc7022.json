In fact, the more likely problem is that the other endpoint would gain that information. I am not the IESG expert on privacy, so I may be making more out of this than is warranted, but I'd really like to see some additional review of the privacy implications of this before it goes out. I assume such review has not occurred because I see no mention of this issue in the security considerations section. Please let me know if I am mistaken. You could clear this DISCUSS either by not using the MAC address, by explaining the working group's rationale for why this isn't a problem in a way that is convincing, or by getting someone with more expertise on the subject than I to review it and explain why it isn't an issue, or by implementing whatever mitigation they suggest. To be honest, given the set of names I see as authors of this document, I assume I am missing something, so please don't hesitate to point out what that is.",
