For a binary body, you'd have to figure out some sort of encoding that could go into UTF-8 framing. The other case is body Content-Types that have non-ASCII and non-UTF-8 charsets. Again, rare, but I would hate to see how implementers deal with putting an ISO-2022-JP body into a UTF-8 frame. I think you've got two solutions: 1) Say \"MUST NOT use UTF-8 framing for non-ASCII/UTF-8 data; or 2) Say \"MUST use binary framing\". I have a slight inclination towards simply requiring binary framing; it's simpler for the implementer and allowing UTF-8 framing at all makes it possible to accidentally do the wrong thing.
