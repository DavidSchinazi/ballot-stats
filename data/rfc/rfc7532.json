I'm looking at section 7.2  http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-protocol-14#section-7.2 , which speaks about OID.  So my OPS AD level of attention suddenly increased.  \u00a0  ... one of the authors was \u00a0  assigned the Internet Private Enterprise Numbers range \u00a0  1.3.6.1.4.1.31103.x.\u00a0 Within this range, the subrange \u00a0  1.3.6.1.4.1.31103.1.x is permanently dedicated for use by the \u00a0  federated file system protocols.

However, reading further, yes, there is a new \"FedFS Object Identifiers\" registry, but it will still use the 1.3.6.1.4.1.31103.1.x range.   Then I looked at existing practice:  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4517 And I see, for example: \u00a0  The LDAP definition for the Other Mailbox syntax is: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.39 DESC 'Other Mailbox' ) From  http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers: 1466 \u00a0 Mark Wahl \u00a0 \u00a0 Mark Wahl \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 M.Wahl& isode.com Is it normal that Standards Track documents register OIDs under enterprise specific numbers (on top of that, representing individuals)?
