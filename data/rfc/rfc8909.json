Section 2: Terminology The definitions provided for \"Differential\" vs \"Incremental\" are the opposite to their standard meaning in backups.\u00a0 The term definitions should be reversed to align with the common vernacular.\u00a0 I.e. differential is the diff against the last full backup, incremental is the backup since the backup (of any type) was performed. 5.1.3.\u00a0 Child\u00a0 element \u00a0  The specification for each object to be escrowed MUST declare the \u00a0  identifier to be used to reference the object to be deleted. An identifier is equally important in the add/update case as well to know which object needs to be updated.\u00a0 I would suggest pulling this sentence out of this subsection and adding a new subsection under 5 to briefly describe the requirement on object identifiers and how they are used both in the delete and contents cases. 5.1.4.\u00a0 Child\u00a0 element \u00a0  When applying Incremental or Differential Deposits (when rebuilding \u00a0  the registry from data escrow deposits) the relative order of the \u00a0 \u00a0 elements is important, as is the relative order of the \u00a0 \u00a0 elements.\u00a0 All the\u00a0 elements MUST be applied \u00a0  first, in the order that they appear.\u00a0 All the\u00a0 elements \u00a0  MUST be applied next, in the order that they appear. I think that the text for processing deposits would be better outside of section 5.1.4, since some of the text is referring to section 5.1.3, and isn't specific to the\u00a0 element. Why does the relative order of\u00a0 elements matter?\u00a0 Is this because of potential dependencies between the elements, if so, it would be useful if that was explicitly stated.\u00a0 If not, then I don't understand why the order of deletes would matter. Also, should there be a statement that an object SHOULD NOT exist multiple times (either in the\u00a0 or\u00a0 elements in a single deposit)? \u00a0  If an object is present in the\u00a0 section of several deposits \u00a0  (e.g.\u00a0 Full and Differential) the registry data from the latest \u00a0  deposit (as defined by the Timeline Watermark) SHOULD be used when \u00a0  rebuilding the registry. This doesn't just apply to objects in the\u00a0 section, but equally applies if the object is present in any\u00a0 or\u00a0 section.\u00a0 I.e. the status of whether an object exists and its contents must be taken from the latest deposit.",
