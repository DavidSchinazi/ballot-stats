From what I could find, the DODAGID is often just an IP address - and subnets are not randomly distributed, nor are L2 addresses (inputs to address generation) - if I know that many of the nodes come from vendor_A, and I know their L2 / MAC range, can I enumerate this, and by extension the DODAGID, and so the hash?
