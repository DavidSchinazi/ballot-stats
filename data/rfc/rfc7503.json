We discussed this a little, and I got the impression that the conclusion was that \"update\" really was intended. In this case you need to (as also discussed): - make this clear in the Abstract (as indicated by idnits) - spend some time in the document (probably the Introduction) explaining how the update works (which is, I believe you are saying, that all new implementations of OSPFv3 are expected to include support for this feature). I do see that you have added to the Introduction: \u00a0  This document describes \u00a0  extensions to OSPFv3 to enable it to operate in these environments. But that is ambiguous. Are the \"MUST\"s in this document mandatory behaviour for an implementation of OSPFv3 or for an implementation of this document which is an option for OSPFv3 implementations? I don't think this is hard to write down, but I don't know what you are trying to achieve.",

From a management point of view, we must be able to determine if a router or interfaces within a router are OSPF-autoconfigured. If I'm not mistaken, you miss, in the management considerations section, something like this: The OSPFv3 routers MUST flag the interfaces supporting this specification.  Background: I recall one particular tool in the past that would check the different router configs and flag the HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval  mismatched values for adjacent routers. This would be equivalent to the following debug: OSPF: Rcv hello from 192.168.0.2 area 0 from FastEthernet0/0 192.168.0.2 OSPF: Mismatched hello parameters from 192.168.0.2 OSPF: Dead R 40 C 60, Hello R 10 C 15\u00a0 Mask R 255.255.255.252 C 255.255.255.252 In case of OSPF auto-config, this check doesn't make any sense.",
