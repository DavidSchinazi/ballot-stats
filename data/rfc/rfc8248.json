I think the document sows confusion in its use of the terms \"transport protocol\" and \"transfer protocol.\" They appear to be used interchangeably (maybe? I'm not actually entirely sure), there seem to be claims that HTTP is a L4 transport protocol, and although the terms \"SACM transport protocol\" and \"SACM transfer protocol\" are used and vaguely defined in the draft, they are not defined in the terminology document. If this document goes forward it seems like an edit pass to clarify what is meant with these terms each time they are used, and their relationship to what we typically think of as a \"transport protocol,\" is warranted. I would have thought target location information would be specifically called out in Section 5.2. I have not seen a response to the Gen-ART review.",

Having said that, if the original intent was for this document to be used as input for the development of the architecture, consider updating some of the text so that there's no mix of \"timing\": the text should probably read as if the architecture/information model don't exist yet; there are no references to them (which is good), but the text makes some mention of them... For example: Section 2 (Requirements) says that it \"describes the requirements used by SACM to assess and compare candidate data models, interfaces, and protocols, to suit the SACM architecture.\"\u00a0 I'm guessing that \"will be used\", and that \"by SACM\" refers to the WG (SACM by itself is used extensively throughout).\u00a0 Note that the end says \"to suit the architecture\", which sounds like the architecture is a foregone conclusion and the requirements are just for the rest. Also in Section 2: \"SACM defines an architecture and information model focused on addressing the needs for determining, sharing, and using posture information via Posture Information Providers and Posture Information Consumers mediated by a Controller.\"\u00a0 I didn't check, but this sounds like a quick description of the architecture and information model -- both of which would be developed based on this document.",

I appreciate it's an extension of the use-cases document and a WG milestone but it reads like the architecture and info model is already done (and indeed WG revisions of that work look mature). In which case I STRONGLY urge that the 10 pages of requirements be placed (as required) in appendices of the milestone documents (information-model, data-model, protocol/Interface, architecture etc). This maintains the rationale for the designs in question and aids the reader in comprehension of the work. That said, with ABSTAIN positions, I am not blocking publication of this document and I shall leave it to the responsible AD to adjudicate.",
