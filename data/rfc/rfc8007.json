I'm not clear on why this is a SHOULD rather than a MUST. If the dCDN tells the uCDN it's going to delete resources after a specified period of time, why shouldn't it follow through on that? For a uCDN that relies on resources not sticking around after a specified period of time (because of security or competitive concerns), doesn't this need to be a firm requirement so that the uCDN doesn't have to issue purge requests to be sure that its resources get deleted? = Section 8.1 = I had the same confusion as Ben and the secdir reviewer concerning whether TLS is always required to use or not. If there are cases in which TLS is not mandatory to use, then I think this should be phrased as a SHOULD with the exceptions clearly enumerated. For example, it's not clear to me whether the only exception is environments where equivalent protections are afforded by a different protocol, or if just being within a single administrative domain is considered protection enough (not sure I agree with the latter).",

Hopefully they will be easy to resolve: - 4.7, 2nd bullet under handling of offline surrogates: I assume I am missing something here. How does a surrogate know that the situation exists in the first place? How would a surrogate know about invalidate commands that happened while it was offline? - 8.1,\u00a0 4th paragraph from the end: The language here is ambiguous about whether the use of TLS is _always_ required, or just when \"such protection is required.\" From context, I assume the latter to be the case. But \"To that end...\" can be interpreted to mean \"In that case, one MUST do X\", or to mean \"In order to make that possible when needed, one MUST _always_ do X\" I propose the following: OLD: \u00a0  In an environment where any such protection is required, mutually \u00a0  authenticated encrypted transport MUST be used to ensure \u00a0  confidentiality of the CI/T information.\u00a0 To that end, TLS MUST be \u00a0  used by CI/T, including authentication of the remote end.
