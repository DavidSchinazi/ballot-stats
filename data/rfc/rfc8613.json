SHOULD NOT\u00a0  This phrase, or the phrase \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" mean that \u00a0  there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the \u00a0  particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full \u00a0  implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed \u00a0  before implementing any behavior described with this label. If the implications are simply \"this is unnecessary but benign,\" then implementors have no real implications to weigh, and the described behavior doesn't rise to the level of \"SHOULD NOT\". If the implications are stronger than that, then *this* document doesn't contain enough information for implementors to perform such an evaluation. In the former case, you can clear this discuss by changing \"SHOULD NOT\" to \"will not typically\". In the latter case, you can clear this discuss by adding enough information for implementors to be able to make an educated weighing of implications. I'm also open to other proposals that remedy this use of 2119 language.",

        "text": "https://mozphab-ietf.devsvcdev.mozaws.net/D3075 DISCUSS My overall concern with this document is that I am unable to evaluate the security properties of the system. I have described a number of issues below, but the basic problem is that this sort of partial protection is extremely hard to reason about and the security considerations do not do an adequate job of evaluating the impact of proxies modifying these values. I am similarly concerned about the HTTP mapping and link section which seems extremely sketchy and has essentially no security analysis, and yet potentially have a lot of landmines. At minimum, this document needs to walk through the implications of modifications by the proxy to every unprotected field in the pure CoAP context as well as the HTTP context (if you want to retain that binding). \u00a0  are given in Appendix A.\u00a0 OSCORE does not depend on underlying \u00a0  layers, and can be used anywhere where CoAP or HTTP can be used, \u00a0  including non-IP transports (e.g., [ I-D.bormann-6lo-coap-802-15-ie ]). \u00a0   IMPORTANT: This document claims to be applicable to protocols other than COAP, in particular HTTP. Has this been reviewed by the HTTP working group? Martin Thomson's review suggests that this is out of step with HTTP practice. \u00a0  IDs MUST be long uniformly random distributed byte strings such that \u00a0  the probability of collisions is negligible. IMPORTANT: I don't understand how this paragraph and the previous paragraph interact. You say that the maximum length is 7 octets in the previous paragraph, which I don't think qualifies as \"long\". \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0  1 | If-Match\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | x |\u00a0  | \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0  3 | Uri-Host\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\u00a0  | x | \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  |\u00a0  4 | ETag\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 | x |\u00a0  | IMPORTANT: Why do you think that it's not important to have integrity protection for Uri-Host and Uri-port? \u00a0  Outer option message fields (Class U or I) are used to support proxy \u00a0  operations. IMPORTANT: This seems problematic because the proxy cannot verify class I fields. \u00a0  layer only, and not the Messaging Layer (Section 2 of [ RFC7252 ]), so \u00a0  fields such as Type and Message ID are not protected with OSCORE. \u00a0   IMPORTANT: This seems extremely hard to reason about. What are the implications of the proxy being able to change these? \u00a0  o\u00a0 request_piv: contains the value of the 'Partial IV' in the COSE \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 object of the request (see Section 5). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  IMPORTANT: I think what I am getting here is that the request_piv is used to verify that the request and response match. However, I do not see this explicitly stated anywhere, and it's not clear to me how the client is supposed to recover the request_piv and the text is pretty unclear here? Is the external_aad carried somewhere in the message? Am I supposed to reconstruct it from the message id? \u00a0  For responses, the message binding guarantees that a response is not \u00a0  older than its request.\u00a0 For responses without Observe, this gives \u00a0   IMPORTANT: I am not sure that this is true. What happens of the counterparty lies? What is your threat model? \u00a0  An extension of OSCORE may also be used to protect group \u00a0  communication for CoAP [ I-D.tiloca-core-multicast-oscoap ].\u00a0 The use \u00a0  of OSCORE does not affect the URI scheme and OSCORE can therefore be \u00a0  used with any URI scheme defined for CoAP or HTTP.\u00a0 The application \u00a0  decides the conditions for which OSCORE is required. This is pretty surprising to just drop in here. Multicast has totally different security properties from non-multicast.",
