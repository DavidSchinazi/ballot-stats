        "text": "The security considerations of this document are inadequate. My review turns up at least the following potential issues which do not seem to be addressed or even discussed: - Amplification: this protocol does not appear to verify that the \u00a0 sender of the query actually owns the IP it claims. Because \u00a0 responses are much larger than queries, this allows for an amplification \u00a0 attack, especially if the client is able to send a query that elicits \u00a0 multiple replies. One defense here would be to fill the rest of the packet \u00a0 with zeroes, thus somewhat reducing the amplification factor. Access \u00a0 control would also help. - Forgery of responses: because the query id is so short, an attacker \u00a0 can generally produce a message which has a nontrivial chance of \u00a0 corresponding to an extant query. This could be addressed by having \u00a0 a query ID that was large and random. - Anyone on-path can forge responses. In addition, Section 9.4 seems inadequate. Isn't it generally the case that who is sending to who is sensitive? This seems like a fairly serious privacy obstacle to using this protocol at all. It seems like many of the issues I raise above would be fixed or at least mitigated by having some sort of access control mechanism.\u00a0 I understand why it might be the case that it's not practical to have full communication security between the links (though it would of course be desirable), but it's not clear to me why arbitrary people should be allowed to instantiate queries.",

        "text": "Thanks for this well written document! However, I think there are a few things that need clarification. I also agree with Ekr's discuss and the tsv-art review (Thanks Brian!) and would like to see stronger access control (as least MUST filter instead of SHOULD). Further, the IANA section is not fully specified. Sec 8.2 doesn't define a registration policy. Sec 8.1. says \"Any additions to \u00a0  this registry are required to fully describe the conditions under \u00a0  which the new Forwarding Code is used.\" which sounds like  RFC8126  \"Specification Required\" which would however include expert review. Is an expert review require/desired here? Also, I think the entry in the port registry should be updated to point to this RFC and reassign the port to the IESG as maintainer of this RFC. Further, based on the feedback provided by the tsv-art review (Thanks Brian again!): How does a receiver distinguish between mtrace version 1 and mtrace2? And also on use of UPD ports: Section 3 says: \"The source port is uniquely selected by the local host operating \u00a0  system.\u00a0 The destination port is the IANA reserved Mtrace2 port \u00a0  number (see Section 8).\" This sounds like the IANA assigned port is used as destination for all mtrace messages including a reply. If that would be the case, you don't have to carry the mtrace client's port #. Can you please clarify? Section 5.2 needs a bit of clarification. This says: \"If no Reply is received at a \u00a0  certain hop, the hop count can continue past the non-responding hop, \u00a0  in the hopes that further hops may respond.\u00a0 These attempts should \u00a0  continue until the [Mtrace Reply Timeout] timeout has occurred.\" This seems to be contradicting. If no Reply is received that means the Mtrace Reply Timeout has occurred, so how and when should you try further attempts. Also I think it would be good to clarify that only one Request MUST be sent at once. I assume that is how Mtrace Reply Timeout is used to rate limit requests (while traditional traceroute often sends multiple packets with different TTLs at once). Right?",
