        "text": "I do think this draft is trying to say all the right things, but there are a few discuss points I'd like to chat about. Some related to wording and some where I may be just confused (which happens easily:-) (1) (This is the same as a discuss point for the other GSMA doc and can be resolved identically.) \"loosely correlated to a user\" seems like its trying to hide that IMEIs are PII. And \"messages intended to convey any level on anonymity\" is not meaningful - what does that really mean when you look at it? (I suspect that might just be unfortunate phrasing from IETF LC discussion.) I suggest you simply state that \"almost all IMEIs are almost always PII and so these URNs MUST be treated as PII in all cases.\"  (2) Section 5 is the key for me here saying that a UAC ought only send this when registering with a 3gpp ims n/w. How does a UAC know when that is happening, vs. when the UAC is registering with some other n/w? Are there any weird b2bua cases here btw?  (3) Should you state somewhere that a UAS (or maybe others too) SHOULD NOT log the instance ID, or if they do, that they need to protect that as PII?\u00a0 I'm not sure if sip.instance is normally logged nor how such log entries are usually treated. (4) Other than TLS, what security mechanism can really be used for protecting these instance IDs?\u00a0 If there is none (that is credible), then wouldn't it be better to leave out the \"or\" bit since that way the UAC can enforce TLS, whereas as is you are forcing the UAC to have a non-TLS option which is probably what'll always get used and maybe will be all that's implemented? (Is that fair? If not, apologies:-)",
