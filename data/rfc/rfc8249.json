Does it  represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?\u00a0   WG LC:  Passed: https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/trill/current/msg07304.html Discussion:  https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/trill/current/msg07210.html This caused me to go investigate further - it seems that there were only 4 comments received during WGLC (excluding the RtgDir review, a short exchange with Julien Meuric). The comments which *were* received largely just fell into the \"Support\" (with no real discussion) category.  The document was adopted 06 March 2015, and then there were a few automated mentions of it (e.g [0], [1]), but I see no real discussion of the draft *in the WG*.  It is entirely possible that my search fu is weak today, and that there has been sufficient discussion and review of the draft (or that none was needed because it is so obviously right and pure, but I'd like some reassurance of that), especially because a quick review found multiple readability issues / nits.  Note: I'm not holding the discuss on the readability / nits, rather on has the process been followed / is there consensus grounds 2: The document also says that it Updates: 6325, 7177, 7780 - but I don't see clear discussion of the Updates (OLD / NEW).
