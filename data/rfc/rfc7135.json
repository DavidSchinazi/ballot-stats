It should be an Informational document on how this mechanism is used in a closed domain of applicability. (Note: I understand that the reason this document was put on the standards track was because the registry rules for Resource-Priority namespace and priority-value registries are both \"Standards Action\" as per  RFC 4412 . I have spoken to Robert and will propose a small document, updating 4412 by changing the registration rules for the registries to \"IETF Review\". That will allow this document to be Informational instead of standards track, but will still require IETF consensus to use these registries. \"Standards Action\" was probably overkill in the first place.)",

        "text": "Three discuss points, but I hope easily sorted. (1) I see from the ecrit archive that there appears to have been more controversy about this than the writeup would indicate. [1] In particular, how does this fit with, or maybe even conflict with,  RFC 5031 ? I'd like to understand if we're specifying two ways to do the same thing, and if so, why there's no explanation or justification of that in this document. (Note: as of now, I've no opinion as to whether or not this and 5031 are the same thing or not, or if one is better than the other, but they are clearly related.) \u00a0  [1]  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ecrit/current/msg07651.html (2) The intro says this is \"not envisioned\" for use on the public Internet because it can be \"trivially forged.\" Saying \"envisioned\" is very weak there. Later you say \"It can also be imagined\" that an ASP \"can have a trust relationship\" allowing use of this. That wins the vague-statememt-of-the-day competition for me:-) On page 4 you say this \"MUST only\" be used when one end is within a local emergency organisation, which appears to allow any UA to add this if calling anyone within a \"local emergency organisaiton\" in \"times of emergency.\" That's again too vague IMO. The last para of section 2 also mentions the ASP case again and says an ASP \"MAY have a trust relationship\" (improper 2119 there I think). All in all its just unclear how a UA developer is supposed to know whether or not to allow this to be turned on and I think it needs to be clearer. (3) I think this is inappropriate use of 2119: \"This document does RECOMMEND the choice within a national jurisdiction be coordinated by all sub-jurisdictions to maintain uniform SIP behavior throughout an emergency calling system of that country.\" You're not talking to an implementer with that, and those are the readers of RFCs. I think you ought change that to say \"The authors of this document think...\" and not imply the IETF has concensus to RECOMMEND that national authorities do stuff in any particular way since we (the IETF a a whole) don't know enough to say that.",
