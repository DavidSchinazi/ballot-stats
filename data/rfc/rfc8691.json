For link-local addresses, is it possible to give recommendations for when IIDs should be re-generated?  = Section 5.2 = \"An Interface ID SHOULD be of length specified in other documents.\" Isn't the length specified for each of the two IID generation mechanisms discussed in Section 4.3 and 4.4? = Section 5.3 = \"The demand for privacy protection of vehicles' and drivers' \u00a0  identities, which could be granted by using a pseudonym or alias \u00a0  identity at the same time, may hamper the required confidentiality of \u00a0  messages and trust between participants\" Pseudonymity and confidentiality are not mutually exclusive, so I think this is incorrect.",
