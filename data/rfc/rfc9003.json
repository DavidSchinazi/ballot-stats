Doesn't the above mostly undercut the value of doing this bis at all? If operators can't expect longer messages to be understood, under what circumstances will they send them? I'm not at all steeped in BGP operations, but was it considered to instead add a new subcode to the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION subcode registry to capture this case (admin reset or shutdown with long shutdown message)? That way at least those who want to use it can differentiate between recipients that don't support  RFC 8203 , those that do, and those that support longer communications.",
