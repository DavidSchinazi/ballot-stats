I appreciate that defining this community will make things easier operationally, but I'm concerned that it will also make it easier to intentionally or unintentionally cutoff traffic to a destination that is not suffering a DDoS attack. I don't see the changes from the -00 to the -02 really helping much in that regard. The change from PS to informational is not terribly meaningful since the community is being registered either way and the removal of the bits about IXPs doesn't mitigate the risks either. If there was a way to authenticate the attribute I would feel differently, but my understanding is that that is not currently possible with BGP. This is far outside my area of expertise so I don't intend to try to block publication or offer anything in the way of an alternative, but I also don't feel comfortable supporting the publication of this document.",

        "text": "First, I have to say that I'm pretty ignorant about practical routing operations, so my plan is to briefly discuss this and to then probably move to an abstain position, unless the issues I raise resonate with folks who are expert in this space. (1) I agree with the points raised in IETF LC that the transitive nature of this proposal has dangers that may outweigh its utility. Was there discussion in the WG about potential solutions that do not have the transitivity property? If so, can you point me at those? If not, is there a reason to think no such solution is feasible?\u00a0 (I suspect the answer may be \"no\" which is the main reason I plan to move to an abstain ballot.) (2) IIUC, this proposal envisages BGP speakers commonly telling others to blackhole specific /32's or /128's. And of course as the draft says BGP doesn't provide us with a way to \"prevent the unauthorized modification of information by the forwarding agent.\" Given those two things, this scheme seems to be an ideal new way to cause any service that advertises a fallback to actually fall back, e.g to use a secondary MX or DNS resolver rather than a primary. That seems like a fine way to try and possibly succeed in attacking many possible things.\u00a0 The discuss point here is to ask if this really is a new attack vector, and if so, if the appropriate level of analysis of its impact has been done? If this is new, then I don't see that the security considerations text adequately describe the range of possible attacks that could be mounted using this scheme. (As an aside, I wonder if asking to blackhole /32's and /128's might impact on routing table sizes and if something ought be said about that?) (3) Given that there are dangers associated with this mechanism, why is there no statement in the draft that actions taken based on this scheme ought be logged or otherwise publicised as a possible way to provide some level of accountability, even if only after the fact?",

        "text": "Firstly, thank you for documenting operational practice. With regards to section 3.3: \"BGP speakers SHOULD only accept and honor BGP announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE community ..\" I really question why this is a \"SHOULD\" and not a \"MUST\", even in an informational RFC. Is the ability for a transit provider so loose that appropriate route filters from a peer ASN can't be applied so that only a \"SHOULD\" is practical? In which case I do question the sanity of making such a recommendation and thus service available if some other ASN might be able to inject the route and affect another service, even by mistake. Potentially if RPKI is in use, then a peer AS might be able to validate the announcement against a ROA. But it strikes me that this is not the machinery you would want to tack on in this case. The same could be said for section 3.2. I would be rather wary of NOT adding a NO_ADVERTISE (at the very least) and to be honest SHOULD still seems far too loose for me. Almost all of the recipe's that I've gazed upon",
