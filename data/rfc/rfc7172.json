I would like to discuss with IESG whether my interpretation of the charter is correct, and if so what actions are appropriate. I see that Ethertype 893B is owned by IETF TRILL Working Group, 155 Beaver Street, Milford MA 01757, UNITED STATES. It is unusual for an IETF WG to own codepoints in other SDOs, and in any case I do not recognize that address as a normal IETF address. Who owns change control and IPR for Ethertype\u00a0 893B? Why is this not clearly an IETF assignment\u00a0 at IETF main office. In any case I think a more precise definition of Ethertype 893B is required that is provided by this draft. There is text that implies that a double nesting of 893B is required, is this the only nesting that is allowed?",
