The IETF should not standardize how another SDO should use SCHC in their architecture, unless that other SDO has specifically asked the IETF to do so. Has 3GPP done so? ### \"Abstract\", paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) \u00a0 \u00a0  and the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) architectures may \u00a0 \u00a0  adopt SCHC to improve their capacities. ``` Would 3GPP be surprised to see this recommendation by the IETF? Has this work item been liaised to and coordinated with 3GPP? Do they expect us to deliver it and do they agree on the content? ### Section 5.1, paragraph 1 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  This section consists of IETF suggestions to the 3GPP. ``` The IETF isn't typically giving suggestions to other SDOs by publishing documents. We do that through liaison activities. Has this work item be liaised to 3GPP? Do they expect us to complete and publish the work so they can normatively refer to it?",
