I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Section 3.2 Very easy to fix but is there a registry for the leading strings 'sha256', ... ? How can it be extended ? What is the exact syntax ? Is there a potential negotiation of support hash algorithms between the parties ? What is the expected error code when the receiver does not support this algo ?",

It looks like the \"Passport Extension\" IANA Registry is only specification required, so one solution would be for this document to be made informational or experimental. Otherwise, I think that this document would benefit from a much clearer and precise split between what part of the document defines the formal specification, and which part is just informative guidance.
