        "text": "This is a really exciting protocol to read about -- the prospect of dropping a bunch of just-manufactured devices in place, spinning up a registrar (and maybe a MASA), and getting a control plane like magic is pretty impressive.\u00a0 That said, I don't believe that this document is ready to publish as-is.\u00a0 I have a list of specific points below for discussion, but it may be more effective to strip down the document a lot (providing a well-defined core protocol and leaving out speculative future work, along the lines of Alissa's comments) and only then start to work on specific rough spots. In particular, in its current form, it's not clear to me why this document is targeting the standards-track -- there are lots of places where determinations of what works best or how to do some things is left for future work.\u00a0 Are there lots of implementations or consumers clamoring for this stuff that it makes sense to go for PS as opposed to Experimental (so as to figure out what works and nail down a slimmer protocol for the standards track)?\u00a0 I see in A.4 that the choice of RPL was motivated by experience with a pre-standard version of ACP; it would have been great to hear more about those deployments in an Implementation Status section (per RFC 7942 ) or the Shepherd writeup. I also think the document needs to be more clear about what security properties it does or does not intend to provide: we hear in the abstract and introduction that ACP will be \"secure\" (and similar platitudes are repeated throughout), but we don't really get a sense of the specifics until Section 4, with ACP5.\u00a0 This has a MUST for authenticated and \"SHOULD (very strong SHOULD)\" be encrypted.\u00a0 But text elsewhere in the document seems to be using \"secure\" to also mean encrypted, and there is even one place that flatly asserts that \"ACP mandates the use of encryption\".\u00a0 This internal inconsistency needs to be resolved, at a minimum, and ideally the intended posture more clearly conveyed.\u00a0 (It's also not really stated under what cases encryption would not be used, so that the \"very strong SHOULD\" could not be a MUST.) Section 3.2 claims that the ACP provides \"additional security\" for bootstrap mechanisms due to the hop-by-hop encryption.\u00a0 But in what sense is actual additional security gained?\u00a0 Against an attacker with what capabilities?\u00a0 If there is security gain from such hop-by-hop encryption, doesn't that point to a weakness in the bootstrap scheme? I think there needs to be some justification of why rfc822Name is chosen over a more conventional structure in the otherName portion of the subjectAltName, which is explicitly designed to be extensible. The requirement in Section 6.1.2 for CRL and OCSP checks seem impossible to satisfy for a greenfield node without non-ACP connectivity, as it must join the ACP domain (and supposedly validate the CRL and OCSP validity before doing so) before establishing an ACP link with its peer, but cannot validate anything with no connectivity. Throughout, the document seems to implicitly conflate authentication with authorization.\u00a0 I understand that the main authorization check is just the domain membership test in Section 6.1.2; nonetheless, as a pedagogical matter I cannot support propagating their conflation. In a few places, the MTI cryptographic mechanisms are under-specified, whether the cipher mode for IKE or the TLS ciphersuites.\u00a0 I have attempted to note these locations in my section-by-section comments. Section 6.11.1.14 places a normative (\"SHOULD\") requirement on the RPL root, but if I understand correctly the RPL root is automatically determined within the ACP, and thus the operator does not a priori know which node will become the RPL root.\u00a0 Am I misunderstanding, or is this effectively placing this requirement on all ACP nodes? The IANA considerations specifically do register SRV.est in the GRASP Objective Names Table, and then follows up with a paragraph that this is only a \"proposed update\".\u00a0 I don't know if there's actually anything problematic here, but the document does need clarity on what is proposed for future work and what is to be done now.",

We're generally in good shape there, but I wanted to check on the point regarding a \"downgrade defense on the meta-negotiation between the protocols\", which in theory would allow an attacker to force the use of IPsec or DTLS or whatever other protocol has a weakness.\u00a0 It seems like there may have been some confusion about DULL vs ACP GRASP in play here, especially with respect to when there might be the possibility of multiple secure channels.\u00a0 My current understanding is that there is not a major issue here, but let's confirm that: DULL GRASP runs only over a local link (using link-local addresses), and as currently defined has the option of flooding advertisements that use either DTLS or IKEv2 to establish the ACP secure channel.\u00a0 DULL GRASP has no cryptographic protections at all, so if there is somehow (e.g., on a multi-access link) an attacker on the link, they could drop or rewrite some announcements to force either DTLS or IKEv2 to be used for secure channel establishment even if the other would normally have been preferred.\u00a0 On directly-connected wired links, such tampering may be unlikely (but not beyond the capabilities of, e.g., a nation-state or well-funded attacker, especially for, e.g., long fiber runs.)\u00a0 By itself, this is not useful, since both DTLS and IKEv2+ESP are believed to be secure, but if some future vulnerability is discovered the downgrade might allow for the vulnerability to be exploited in cases it would not otherwise have been usable.\u00a0 Countermeasures to allow detection of this kind of tampering are possible -- include as part of the DTLS or IKEv2 exchange (or the first operation after it) a preference-ordered list of supported secure channel mechanisms, and bail out if the mechanism being used is not the most-preferred shared mechanism -- but will still fail if the vulnerability in question is sufficiently severe to allow handshake forgery. ACP GRASP is different, in that it (1) runs over the ACP, so any on-path attack to drop/rewrite GRASP would have as a prerequisite an attacker in the ACP, and (2) unicast GRASP is protected end-to-end by TLS.\u00a0 However, it seems like broadcast/flooded ACP GRASP objectives will only have the hop-by-hop ACP protection and so would in theory also be subject to a downgrade attack if there was an in-ACP on-path attacker.\u00a0 It also seems like there's a general expectation that ACP services will run over TLS, and the option of \"TLS *or* DTLS (or something else)\" is not expected to be common, so the existence of a downgrade to a different protocol is rare as well. While I would like to be able to defend against downgrade attacks by an in-ACP on-path attacker, I recognize that it's a defensible position to take that we assume all entities in the ACP to remain secure and just accept the corresponding risks in the case of compromise.\u00a0 Similarly, for \"big iron\" router deployments, physical links are the norm and the DULL GRASP downgrade attack may not be a practical concern; I would again like to have the mechanisms in place to be able to detect downgrade if, for example, deployments broaden to the use of radio technologies, but the absence of such a mechanism does not seem like a critical flaw at this time.\u00a0 So, to be clear, the DISCUSS here is just to be sure that we're all on the same page as to what point Ekr was making and the current state of affairs; given my current understanding, I'm not holding a DISCUSS point for \"add the downgrade-detection mechanism\" (though I do encourage it). It looks like Section 6.1.3 is missing a \"rule 6: verify that the acp-address/prefix in the certificate matches the address being used to talk to the peer\", if I'm reading between the lines properly.\u00a0 (If not, and this is just skew introduced by editing, my comments about references to a non-existent rule 6 apply, see COMMENT.)",

A ladder diagram would really help me here, because I'm confused about the order of events. As I understand it, Alice and Bob are both flooding their AN_ACP objectives. So, Alice sees Bob's and starts trying to connect to Bob. But Bob may not have Alice's objective, right? So, in the case you describe below, she just has to wait for it before she can try the remaining security protocols? I note that you have no downgrade defense on the meta-negotiation between the protocols, so an attacker could potentially force you down to the weakest joint protocol. Why did you not provide a defense here?

It's not difficult to create a new domain with the same 40bit hash. If you have a private CA, this probably isn't an issue, but if you are sharing a public CA, it would allow me to produce a domain with other people's addresses. S 8.1.1. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 configured to be put into the ACP VRF.\u00a0 The ACP is then accessible to >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 other (NOC) systems on such an interface without those systems having >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to support any ACP discovery or ACP channel setup.\u00a0 This is also >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 called \"native\" access to the ACP because to those (NOC) systems the >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 interface looks like a normal network interface (without any >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 encryption/novel-signaling). This seems pretty unclear. Is the idea that you connect natively to the ACP Connect node and then it forwards your packets over the ACP? Does that mean they need to be GRASP or whatever? I think that's what you are saying below. S 8.1.5. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 interface is physically protected from attacks and that the connected >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Software or NMS Hosts are equally trusted as that on other ACP nodes. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ACP edge nodes SHOULD have options to filter GRASP messages in and >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 out of ACP connect interfaces (permit/deny) and MAY have more fine- >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 grained filtering (e.g., based on IPv6 address of originator or >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 objective). Given that this is an important security requirement, it seems like it should be a normative requirement that it be filtered. S 9.1. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 same trust anchor, a re-merge will be smooth. >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Merging two networks with different trust anchors requires the trust >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 anchors to mutually trust each other (for example, by cross-signing). >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As long as the domain names are different, the addressing will not >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 overlap (see Section 6.10). Why does it require the *trust anchors* to trust each other? Can't the endpoints just have the union of the trust anchors. This is way underspecified for actual implementation. S 10.2.1. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 registrar can rely on the ACP and use Proxies to reach the candidate >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ACP node, therefore allowing minimum pre-existing (auto-)configured >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 network services on the candidate ACP node.\u00a0 BRSKI defines the BRSKI >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 proxy, a design that can be adopted for various protocols that >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pledges/candidate ACP nodes could want to use, for example BRSKI over >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), or proxying of Netconf. I am finding it very difficult to work out the security properties of this mechanism and the security considerations do not help. What can a malicious registrar do? For that matter, you say \"uncoordinated\", so does that mean anyone in the ACP can just decide to be a registrar? S 11. >\u00a0   >\u00a0  11.\u00a0 Security Considerations >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 An ACP is self-protecting and there is no need to apply configuration >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to make it secure.\u00a0 Its security therefore does not depend on >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 configuration. This is not true. You need to configure the trust anchor and the domain name. S 11. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  all products. >\u00a0   >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There is no prevention of source-address spoofing inside the ACP. >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This implies that if an attacker gains access to the ACP, it can >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 spoof all addresses inside the ACP and fake messages from any other >\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 node.
