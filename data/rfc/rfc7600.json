You are asking for three new DHCPv6 option codes from the \"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)\" registry \"Option Codes\" sub-registry. Now, that sub-registry is marked \"Expert Review and Standards Action\" which is slightly ambiguous.\u00a0 So I went to  RFC 3315  where I found... \u00a0  New DHCP option codes are tentatively assigned after the \u00a0  specification for the associated option, published as an Internet \u00a0  Draft, has received expert review by a designated expert [11].\u00a0 The \u00a0  final assignment of DHCP option codes is through Standards Action, as \u00a0  defined in  RFC 2434  [11]. So, you can't have code points for an Experimental RFC. Rather than move this document to the Standards Track, I suggest you take advantage of  draft-ietf-softwire-map-dhcp  which is on the Standards Track and is already in the pipe.\u00a0 If you update that document to ask for these code points, and include a normative reference to this I-D everything should work out fine.",
