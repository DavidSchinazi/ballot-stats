        "text": "I have a few DISCUSS questions about some of the security aspects of the draft, that I would like the authors to at least consider. It seems this new registry is getting pre-populated with a _lot_ of \"insecure\" variants. Is there a strong reason why to not only add 1 insecure entry (eg crc32c) ? New RFCs really should not be adding anything using MD5 or SHA1, even if we allow/accept it is used insecure (see below for details). The other question on the IANA Registry I have is the format and registration policy. Recently, most security related IANA Registries try to use a RECOMMENDED column that can only be set to Y using a registration policy of RFC Required. Any other registration (eg via specification required or FCFS) cannot get RECOMMENDED Y. Also, to change the RECOMMENDED column requires a standards track RFC (via RFC Required policy). Is there a reason we cannot do the same here? I also think a Designated Expert should not be able to change what is \"standard\" or not, as the word \"standard\" strongly implies \"standard track\" or at the very least \"IETF consensus\" which is not the same as a DE making a decision on their own. This would also resolve my issue of specifying things as \"standard\" (when it didn't come in via standards track RFC) and \"insecure\" (which really seems to mean \"secure for this type of usage, but not that type of usage), so I would strongly prefer this indirection to be removed, and state a usage of \"checksum only\" and \"signed hash\". Finally, I think some more careful writing is needed around the case of integrity vs integrity+signature and what it protects against. I don't think \"unintended or malicious data corruption\" should be used as a type. Either talk about \"unintended\" or talk about \"malicious\" - the two cannot be used within a single concept unless you mandate integrity+signature. If multiple hashes are included, what should happen when the most preferred hash failed to verify? Should it be treated as failed or should it try other less preferred but accepted hash algorithms? There should be text clarifying the behaviour. Personally, I would prefer that only the most preferred hash is checked and the other hashes are ignored, but perhaps I'm not fully aware of common operational issues.",
