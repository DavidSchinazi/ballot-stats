Similarly, \u00a76.1 defines, somewhat in passing, some \"local IGMP Membership Request (x,G) state\" that must be maintained in some cases. Let's discuss whether it's appropriate/useful to have a general introductory section that covers what new state PEs are expected to retain as part of supporting IGMP/MLD proxying.\u00a0 Maybe the answer is \"no\", but I would like to have the conversation. (2) I am not sure if the body text is consistent with what is being allocated from IANA.\u00a0 \u00a78 describes PEs that are not using ingress replication as being identifiable as \"\"\"any PE that has advertised an Inclusive Multicast Tag route for the BD without the \"IGMP Proxy Support\" flag\"\"\", but the IANA considerations allocate flags for both IGMP Proxy Support and MLD Proxy Support.\u00a0 Is a PE that advertises MLD Proxy Support but not IGMP Proxy Support to be treated as not using ingress replication, as the literal interpretation of this text would require?\u00a0 Similarly, \u00a79.2.1 and \u00a79.3.1 include restrictions on indication of support for \"IGMP Proxy\" with no mention of \"MLD Proxy\".
