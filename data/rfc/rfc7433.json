        "text": "4: \u00a0  The \"purpose\" header field parameter identifies the package \u00a0  which defines the generation and usage of the UUI data for a \u00a0  particular application. I think you need to add something like: \"The value of the 'purpose' parameter is the package name, as registered in the uui-packages sub-registry defined in section 6.3.\" It took me a while to figure out that that's what you intended. (I *think* that's what you intended.) \u00a0  For the case of interworking with the ISDN \u00a0  UUI Service, the ISDN UUI Service interworking package is used.\u00a0 If \u00a0  the \"purpose\" header field parameter is not present, interworking \u00a0  with the ISDN UUI Service MUST be assumed. This creates a hard dependency on  draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-isdn , since you are making ISDN the default. You'll need to move that document to Normative References if you do that. I think it's best not to do that and instead strike the sentence and instead say that 'purpose' is REQUIRED. 5: \u00a0  UUI packages defined using this SIP UUI mechanism MUST follow the \u00a0  \"Standards Action\" guideline as defined in [ RFC5226 ] and publish a \u00a0  standards track RFC which describes the usage. This seems bogus. First of all, \"Standards Action\" is a registration guideline, not a use guideline, so this MUST seems completely wrong. If I want to use a private-use package I see absolutely no interoperability reason I should be disallowed from doing so. See comments on section 6 below for more on the choice of the guideline. 6.3: \"Standards Action\" seems like complete overkill. I would like to hear an explanation of why First Come First Served (FCFS) is not appropriate for these packages. If I get a package I don't understand, I'm going to ignore it, so if you want to send (and register) one that is not already defined, I don't see why you can't just register it. We know that anything more than FCFS does actual interoperability damage by encouraging the community to do all sorts of unregistered extensions. What is the problem with doing these things as FCFS, or maybe \"Expert Review\"? 6.4: I don't understand why this needs an IANA registry at all. As far as I can tell, content is entirely dependent on the package definition. That means that if I define \"foo\" content for my package, you could define \"foo\" content for your package and there will be no problem with the two names colliding. Why do you need a registry for these? Is there going to be content that is package-independent? If so, you may want to explain what those would be like in section 4.",

(1) section 3: Would I be wrong to claim that SIP S/MIME stuff being mythical means that REQ 13 is not met in any meaningful sense? (REQ 14 is sort of met via hop by hop TLS I guess.) I suggest you just say that SIP end-to-end data integrity is practically non existent so REQ 13 is not in fact met. You do recognise this reality in section 7, but nonetheless the claim that REQ-13 has been met isn't really tractable. (2) 4.2: this says BEEF == beef but what if real data integrity had been provided, which is canonical, upper or lower case? Picking one now will mean that when REQ-13 does get met, things will work as expected.\u00a0 (Or say that there no c14n and that case mapping MUST NOT be done.) Had REQ-13 really been met you would have had to address this already btw. (3) 4.3, last para: Why does the User-to-User parameter in a History-info field functionality \"win\" over a privacy protecting proxy or B2BUA? Sounds to me like a SHOULD NOT that will not be honoured. Wouldn't it be better to simply note that a B2BUA might break the User-to-User stuff and leave it at that?
