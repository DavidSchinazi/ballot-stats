If this is not your intention, I think you will need to remove the  \"Updates\" tag.  In either case, once this and my other issues are resolved, I will be happy to move to a \"Yes\" ballot. --- In Section 3.1 you have \u00a0  The \"Enhanced Route Refresh Capability\" is a new BGP capability \u00a0  [ RFC5492 ].\u00a0 IANA has assigned a Capability Code of 70 for this \u00a0  capability.

If an attacker can see the BoRR go by, and can then force the TCP connection down before the EoRR is seen (and stop new TCP connections coming up for as long as the purge timer), the receiver marking the routes as stale with a timeout before purging could cause the receiver to purge all the sender's routes.\u00a0 I guess receivers could maybe detect this (because they're no longer hearing from the sending peer and have only marked the routes as stale because of the BoRR) and not purge the routes in that specific case, but I'm not sure if it'd be worth noting that.
