I'm concerned that performing a source address filtering isn't necessarily that secure, compared with use NETCONF or RESTCONF that can provide AAA access controls.\u00a0 Hence, I think that the security considerations should REQUIRE that IOAM daemons do not respond to these capability requests unless explicitly configured to do so, specifically to avoid implementations potentially leaking information if they are not aware of this functionality (e.g., if it was enabled by default).",

        "text": "Thank you very much for writing this document. Please see:  https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/handling-ballot-positions/ My concerns are closely related to Roman's DISCUSS point: The document says: \"A deployment can increase security by using border filtering of incoming and outgoing echo requests/replies.\" I'm unclear why this is just a \"can increase security\", and not something much much stronger -- but, also, I'm unclear how exactly an operator would be expected to filter these. The Abstract says: \"This document describes an extension to the echo request/reply mechanisms used in [...]\", but from what I can tell, it is more \"here are some containers that you could use in some other protocols\". It seems like, instead of only relying on the network for filtering (which doesn't yet seem to be implemented), the: \"To protect against unauthorized sources using echo request messages to obtain IOAM Capabilities information, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide a means of checking the source addresses of echo request messages against an access list before accepting the message.\" should be made stronger. Implementations need to be created to understand IOAM, and so requiring that they have the capability to only accept configured source addresses seems simple.",
