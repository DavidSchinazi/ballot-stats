In short, should we be seeking to define a distinct key combination operation like KRB-FX-CF2 ( RFC6113 ) rather than trying to repurpose key derivation?\u00a0 Some KDFs support this fairly well, but it's not clear to me that it is a universal property.\u00a0 For example, the proof in [H2019] seems to be assuming HKDF but this draft does not (as is clearly seen from the use of the X9.63 KDF in one of the examples).",
