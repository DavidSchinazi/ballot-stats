(This is also related to discuss-point-2 below) (2) section 6: It's a pity there's no ISO document to reference in this section as PDF files have been the vector for various threats over the years. Can't you find some reference (from ISO or not) that a viewer or author developer would find helpful? That section seems pretty vague to me as-is. (In particular the last clause of the last sentence in this section is not useful.) And I see from the discussion of the secdir review ([1], did any authors respond to that? If so I didn't see it, sorry).\u00a0 The discuss point here is that we seem to have less good security considerations compared with  RFC3778 , and I think that ought be justified if it's the right thing to do. (Not necessarily in the document if that's not correct, but at least as part of the record, e.g. in response to this.) \u00a0  [1]  https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg06674.html comments",
