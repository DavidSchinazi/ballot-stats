        "text": "Here is another validation issue, on the latest v13, that must be corrected. Actually multiple mistakes, all with the same root cause. Note that those warnings were reported in the datatracker: \u00a0  - Yang catalog entry for ietf-l3-unicast-topology-state@2017-11-15.yang \u00a0  - Yang catalog entry for ietf-l3-unicast-topology@2017-11-15.yang Thanks to Michal, here is the detailed explanation. Hi Benoit,  firstly, you see the output only with -V because it changes verbosity to 'warnings' instead of the default one 'errors'. So, the warnings are valid and the when conditions are wrong. In short, in these cases the local module is not ietf-l3-unicast-topology, but ietf-network (despite being defined in ietf-l3-unicast-topology) - \"ietf-network:network-types/l3-unicast-topology\" should be \"ietf-network:network-types/ietf-l3-unicast-topology:l3-unicast-topology\" or even \"network-types/ietf-l3-unicast-topology:l3-unicast-topology\". To explain, here is the (long) justification. I will use the first warning as an example, all the other warnings are caused by the same mistake. We are dealing with a when condition \"nw:network-types/l3-unicast-topology\" in an augment \"/nw:networks/nw:network\" in the module ietf-l3-unicast-topology. As per [1], the context node of the XPath expression (when condition) is the augment target node \"/nw:networks/nw:network\". If you notice, the warning warns about not finding the node \"l3-unicast-topology\", not \"nw:network-types\". So, what node is actually referenced by \"l3-unicast-topology\"? Looking at [2], second bullet point, the namespace (prefix) should that of the \"current node\". Sadly, there is no (I have found none) formal definition of \"current node\" but I dared to assume it to be the node returned by the \"current()\" [3] function. As was said at the beginning, the \"initial context node\" is \"/nw:networks/nw:network\". Finally, we can now decide that \"l3-unicast-topology\" actually takes the prefix of the module \"ietf-network\" and there is no such node, this node is defined in the module \"ietf-l3-unicast-topology\". I hope it is clear now.
