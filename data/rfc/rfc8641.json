(pro-forma) I see the GenArt reviewer noted the author count (seven) already, but I couldn't find a response or note in the ballot or shephert writeup acknowledging this.\u00a0 So failing that, I'll put up a discuss point until the responsible AD says it's fine. [See also discussion on draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed notifications about the pre-RFC5378 boilerplate and whether or not it can be removed from this document] Section 3.3 states: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In order for a subscriber to determine whether objects \u00a0  support on-change subscriptions, objects are marked accordingly on a \u00a0  publisher.\u00a0 Accordingly, when subscribing, it is the responsibility \u00a0  of the subscriber to ensure it is aware of which objects support on- \u00a0  change and which do not.\u00a0 For more on how objects are so marked, see \u00a0  Section 3.10. Chasing the reference, we see that this marking is left for future work or implementation-specific usage.\u00a0 I'm not very comfortable with the way we are describing this situation, as it seems pretty fragile in the face of different implementations trying to interoperate.",
