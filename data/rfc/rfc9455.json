It seems as though it's the kind thing to do for users of  BCP 185  -- it's the way we have, in our document set, of saying \"oh hi, please don't assume all the information is just in this document here, please go check there too\".",

Unfortunately, the shepherd did not explain that. \u00a0  Any ROA object that includes resources which are a) no longer contained in the new CA certificate, or b) [...] , will be rejected as invalid. Isn't a) the normal expected case? I understand case b) but why is case a) listed here? Or is this saying a ROA with 10 prefixes, of which 1 prefix is no longer in the parent CA, will cause the entire ROA with 10 prefixes to be invalid, and not retain 9 valid prefixes? If so, I think the text should be clarified to say that more clearly. If no so, then I think this case should be omitted from the sentence as it wouldn't be relevant to a \"problem case\".",
