        "text": "I have three points to discuss, I think these may be fairly easy to resolve, or maybe not, but I'd like to chat about 'em. (1) HTTP Auth: is it ok for a client to send it's e.g. basic auth credential to any of the servers that the client can validate? I.e., is an additional level of pinning needed for this? That would be a new form of pinning and is not defined for either TLS or SSH afaik. That could also be done in various ways and I'm not sure if those might have interoperability consequences. Or perhaps if not doing that, this draft should say something about a need for stronger credentials esp. for basic auth. Did the WG consider this? (2) The secdir review [1] calls out issues related to TLS-PSK and (I guess also) bare keys. I think it'd be good to be speific as to wheher or how those are to be supported here. If you are going to say those are supported, then I suspect some additional text is needed. Kent's answer to that (which was \"see  RFC7589 \" as I read it) doesn't quite do it here I think. that says that certificates must be supported (which is fine)  but doesn't say that TLS-PSK or bare keys can or cannot be  supported. \u00a0  [1]  https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg06087.html (3) Consider zmap. When this is deployed, what'll be the effect of surveys that fingerprint all of the devices on the visible Internet who implement this protocol? Did the WG consider that? I'm not sure of the impact, if any, but it could be good if there's a way to help deployments end up less vulnerable to fingerprinting (and the ensuing exposure to unpatched vulns).",
