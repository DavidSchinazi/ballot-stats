The draft appears to be in good shape overall; I just have one process point I would like to DISCUSS before approval: Section 12 appears to be an update to  draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos , which is currently in the RFC Editor queue in the MISSREF state. It's not clear to me what the intent of this section is, but if the idea is to formally update a _draft_, then please do not do that. The right way to proceed would be to pull  draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos  from the RFC editor queue and make the changes there. The UPDATES relationship is intended for updating RFCs, which are otherwise immutable. Drafts, even post-IESG approval and in the RFC editor queue can still be changed. Making readers figure out the update between two different RFCs when there is an option to just fix the draft would be a disservice to readers.",
