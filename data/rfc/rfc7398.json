        "text": "1. The charter says: The WG will seek to develop new metrics and models to more accurately characterize the network paths under test and/or the performance of transport and application layer protocols on these paths. However, the work seems to be targeting LMAP only. It looks like some LMAP work is done in IPPM. Looking at the authors list, the same set of people is involved in both IPPM and LMAP, so that's minor issue. However, my primary concern :is this reference path is for LMAP ONLY? This is what the title says. I understand that the primary audience for now is LMAP, but hopefully it could be reused somewhere else in the future for access network Why not? OLD Title: A Reference Path and Measurement Points for LMAP NEW Title: A Reference Path and Measurement Points Or NEW Title: A Reference Path and Measurement Points for Access Networks OLD abstract: \u00a0 \u00a0 This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for commonly used performance metrics. Other similar measurement projects may also be able to use the extensions described here for measurement point location. NEW abstract: \u00a0 \u00a0 This document defines a reference path for measurement points for commonly used performance metrics, such as Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Access Performance (LMAP). Btw,\u00a0 I would add to the abstract: \u00a0  The purpose is to create an efficient way to describe the location of \u00a0  the measurement point(s) used to conduct a particular measurement. Some more changes might be required as well. For example: The scope of this memo is to define a reference path for LMAP activities with sufficient level of detail to determine the location of different measurement points along a path without ambiguity. 2. What if I want to add an extra element type in the reference path in section 4? For example, a service type for service chaining: physical versus virtual For example, I need to make the distinction between ISP-managed and subscribed-managed measurement agents on the subscriber device  Are the types extensible? How? This should be specified. 3. From my discussion with Brian Trammell (just on, on the two points above), I realized that the reference path could be used in future performance metric definition. Some text should be added.",

In the referenced framework draft, the list of privacy-sensitive items in 8.2 makes sense.\u00a0 Since the reference path is the path traversed by a flow of data (if I have the definition correct per the other questions), couldn't an attacker use the path information to perform a DoS or other attack at one or more points along the path?\u00a0 Wouldn't this be both a security and privacy consideration?\u00a0 I can see that all of the information about a device in the path could reveal privacy related data, but the host information could be used to take out (DoS) or compromise a point in the network as well. Current text: \u00a0  When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those \u00a0  whose traffic is measured, there is sensitive information \u00a0  communicated to recipients of the network diagrams illustrating paths \u00a0  and measurement points described above.\u00a0 We refer the reader to the \u00a0  privacy considerations described in the Large Scale Measurement of \u00a0  Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [ I-D.ietf-lmap-framework ], \u00a0  which covers active and passive measurement techniques and supporting \u00a0  material on measurement context. Perhaps adding in a sentence between those to highlight that attacks, such as DoS or other attacks, are possible along the Reference Path or identified measurement points.",
