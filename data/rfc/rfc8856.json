        "text": "Update: After a bit of discussion and a re-read of  draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes , I see that, while the use of \"TBD\" does not seem consistent with the definition of TBD, it does seem consistent with the practice in mux-attributes of assigning a category of TBD to attributes associated with non-muxable protocols. I've sent an email to the MMUSIC WG for guidance on the intended use. In the process, I noticed that the category assignments in this draft do not match the existing assignments in mux-attributes, which marks \"floorctrl\" as \"TBD\", and the others as \"NORMAL\". This draft marks all attributes as \"TBD\". I am going to hold the DISCUSS position for now, until discussion of the use of TBD resolves a bit further, and until the assignment mismatch is corrected.

We also had a very long discussion about the usage of the term \"initial  offer\" in the context of  draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation ; I do not propose to rehash that discussion, but want to ask whether we should stick to the established precedent with regard to the use of the term (which, IIUC, would involve a change to this document).",

The reason is that with ICE you can flip between different candidates as part of the negotiation. So what happens if I initially get a UDP candidate and then via aggressive nomination settle on TCP (or vice versa). DTLS and TLS aren't really interoperable in that way. It would be far better to do what WebRTC does and when you do ICE, always do DTLS even if it's over TCP.",
