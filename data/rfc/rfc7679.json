        "text": "I am confused about the last sentence in this methodology step in Section 3.6: \"+ At the Src host, select Src and Dst IP addresses, and form a test \u00a0  packet of Type-P with these addresses.\u00a0 Any 'padding' portion of the \u00a0  packet needed only to make the test packet a given size should be \u00a0  filled with randomized bits to avoid a situation in which the \u00a0  measured delay is lower than it would otherwise be due to compression \u00a0  techniques along the path.\u00a0 Note that use of transport layer \u00a0  encryption will counteract the deployment of network-based analysis \u00a0  and may reduce the adoption of network-based payload optimizations \u00a0  like compression.\" I don't understand what is implied about the relationship between transport layer encryption and one-way delay measurements. I thought the metric defined in this document was generally used for end-to-end measurement of delay, so I don't understand what \"network-based analysis\" has to do with this methodology step. Is the implication that if the measurement packet is encrypted at the transport layer that delay will change? If that is true, isn't the metric itself agnostic to that consideration -- that is, couldn't that be precisely what the person doing the measurements wants to measure? I could quibble with the conclusions of the note itself (e.g., increased transport layer encryption may change but not necessarily reduce network-based \"analysis\" of various sorts), but mainly I do not understand how it relates to the specification of the metric. Unfortunately the rationale given in Section 1 (\"Added text recognizing the impending deployment of transport layer encryption in section 3.6\") does not clarify this either. What impending deployment is this referencing?",
