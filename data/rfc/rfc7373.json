If not, then I think this ought define such values for each type. The logic for that, is also related to a missing security consideration - IPFIX data in this format will likely be more easily searchable and aggregatable and hence more sensitive than binary or other formats. The idea would be that anyone creating or schlepping around data in this form would then have a well known way to elide values when they decide that's the right thing to do, and without confusing the receiver/reader into thinking that some odd value was real. Its kind of like NaN, but for privacy, and not arithmetical, reasons.  Resolving this might mean defining such \"not telling\" values elsewhere, or here. So I might well accept punting on tihs if you tell me it'll be done, but please do push back if you think I'm just wrong in the above and don't ask to punt on this if you disagree with it (yes, its been known to happen;-).  I do think noting the new security consideration would be good regardless but that is not by itself discuss-worthy.",
