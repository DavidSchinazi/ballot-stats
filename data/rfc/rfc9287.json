Now, this is in reference to a bit - which can only be 0 or 1 - and the document further goes on to clarify certain situations where this bit should be set or unset - so I am not at all sure what this paragraph really means and hoping this can be clarified because I'm not sure how this will be interpreted on implementation.",
