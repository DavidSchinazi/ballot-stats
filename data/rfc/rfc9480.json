        "text": "# GEN AD review of  draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-updates-19 CC @larseggert Thanks to Linda Dunbar for the General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) review ( https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gen-art/tmyYLBLQxKjt0p-omYT9UEcdvQQ ). ## Comments ### Section 1, paragraph 4 ``` \u00a0 \u00a0  As the main content of  RFC 4210  [ RFC4210 ] and  RFC 6712  [ RFC6712 ] \u00a0 \u00a0  stays unchanged, this document lists all sections that are updated, \u00a0 \u00a0  replaced, or added to the current text of the respective RFCs. ``` I found it impossible to actually review this document, because I am not very familiar with the three documents that this one is updating, replacing or adding to. This document is basically a sed script, not a technical specification. I think the interested community should really consider publishing an actual bis document here. ### DOWNREFs DOWNREF `[ RFC7299 ]` from this Proposed Standard to Informational ` RFC7299 `. (For IESG discussion. It seems this DOWNREF was not mentioned in the Last Call and also seems to not appear in the DOWNREF registry.) ### Inclusive language Found terminology that should be reviewed for inclusivity; see https://www.rfc-editor.org/part2/#inclusive_language  for background and more guidance:  * Term `invalid`; alternatives might be `not valid`, `unenforceable`, `not \u00a0  binding`, `inoperative`, `illegitimate`, `incorrect`, `improper`, \u00a0  `unacceptable`, `inapplicable`, `revoked`, `rescinded` ## Nits All comments below are about very minor potential issues that you may choose to address in some way - or ignore - as you see fit. Some were flagged by automated tools (via  https://github.com/larseggert/ietf-reviewtool ), so there will likely be some false positives. There is no need to let me know what you did with these suggestions. ### Outdated references Reference `[ RFC2510 ]` to ` RFC2510 `, which was obsoleted by ` RFC4210 ` (this may be on purpose). ### Grammar/style #### Section 1.1, paragraph 3 ``` related to the base specification. Hence references to the original sections \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ^^^^^ ``` A comma may be missing after the conjunctive/linking adverb \"Hence\". #### Section 2.14, paragraph 1 ``` hm. The contents of the optional parameters field will vary according to the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ^^^^^^^^^^ ``` An apostrophe may be missing. #### Section 2.26, paragraph 4 ``` related to the base specification. Hence references to the original sections \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ^^^^^ ``` A comma may be missing after the conjunctive/linking adverb \"Hence\". #### Section 2.30, paragraph 1 ``` ich updates CMC. Special thank also goes also to Russ Housley, Lijun Liao, Ma \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ``` Adverb repetition. ## Notes This review is in the [\"IETF Comments\" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the [`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into individual GitHub issues.

UPDATE: I've completed my review of -21: #1: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  This is a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  very sensitive service and therefore needs specific \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  authorization.\u00a0 This authorization is with the CA \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  certificate itself.\u00a0 Alternatively, the CA MAY delegate the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  authorization by placing the id-kp-cmKGA extended key usage \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  in the certificate used to authenticate the origin of the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  generated private key or the delegation MAY be determined \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  through local configuration of the end entity. These two MAYs are related, you MUST do one or the other. The text as it can be interpreted to not perform either MAYs. #2 \u00a0  Such validity periods SHOULD \u00a0  NOT be used for protection of CMP messages and key generation. \u00a0  Certificates containing one of the above EKUs SHOULD NOT use \u00a0  indefinite expiration date. This leaves a rather unspecified part on the implementer. What time period is too much? Clearly something between a few seconds and indefinite, but what is it? Can this document make a recommendation ? #3  Throughout the document, Section references for the to-be-patched RFC are turned into links for this RFC, eg in the text \"Replace Section 5.1.3.4 - Multiple Protection\" in Section 2.6 where the section title has a bad link but the section body has the right link. Please verify all of these references and fix where needed. #4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It MAY \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 include the original PKIMessage from the EE in the generalInfo \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 field of PKIHeader of a nested message (to accommodate, for \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 example, cases in which the CA wishes to check POP or other \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 information on the original EE message). If a CA wishes to do so, it would REQUIRE this original PKIMessage. Would it not be better to say \"It MUST include the original PKIMessage\" ? It seems also generally better to send the originals along with the modification so that the next step can (optionally!) authenticate the previous step. Otherwise, there is a lot of implied trust that should be modeled in the Security Considerations.  #5 In Section 2.20, it talks abot updating 4210's Section 7. It suggests removing the first 3 paragraphs with replacement text. However, the text removed describes the behaviour in a version agnostic way that I think is more clear than the replacement text. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If the client does not accept EnvelopedData, but EncryptedValue, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then it MUST use cmp2000. Why not cmp1999? Because EncryptedValue is valid for cmp1999  RFC2510  as well? Are we assuming cmp1999 is completely dead and no longer deployed? In general I would clarify section 2.20 better. More clearly subdivide client and server, and leave a version of the text in Section 7 before section 7.1 intact. Also, it seems the into in the original Section 7 really covers the protocol behaviour. I am not sure why there are subsections with specific version numbers in 4210 nor do I understand why this has to be patched to an even more elaborate versioning, and mentioning EncryptedValue vs EncryptedEnvelope. It seems the section 7 overview covers all behaviour already. #6 Section 3.4 \"patches\" the IANA Considerations. I'd rather we didn't do this and add a clear new IANA Considerations section with clear complete instructions to IANA as to what changes to make, but I understand perhaps why to do this from a readability point of view. But at the very least leave a note to the RFC Editor to confirm all IANA Actions for this document are summarized in this document's IANA Considerations. \u00a0 \u00a0 < TBD: The temporary registration of cmp URI suffix must be updated \u00a0  from provisional to permanent. > IANA will do this when the document goes from draft to RFC. So this comment can safely be removed. \u00a0  < TBD: A new protocol registry group \"Certificate Management Protocol \u00a0  (CMP)\" (at  https://www.iana.org/assignments/cmp ) and an initial entry \u00a0  'p' must be registered. > Same here. Section 4 IANA Considerations should contain a copy of the \"patch\" instructions as a clear instruction to IANA so they can make the changes without them needing to \"patch\" the old RFC to obtain the instructions. Even if this sounds redundant in this document.",
