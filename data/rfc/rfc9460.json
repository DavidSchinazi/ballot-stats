        "text": "I'd like to have a (hopefully brief!) discussion about our description of the \"strict transport security\" functionality the HTTPS RRtype provides, with respect to its accuracty/completeness and how explicit vs implicit we should be about the corresponding divergence from \"pure\" HTTP behavior. It's pretty clear that at a pure HTTP protocol level (which as far as I can tell is the scope of applicability that we claim) that resources accessed with \"http\" scheme and resources accessed with \"https\" scheme have no intrinsic relationship -- \u00a74.2.2 of draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-19  says: \u00a0  Resources made available via the \"https\" scheme have no shared \u00a0  identity with the \"http\" scheme.\u00a0 They are distinct origins with \u00a0  separate namespaces.\u00a0 [...] But the procedures in this document (e.g., \u00a79.5, \u00a79) seem pretty clear that, when an HTTPS record is published, accesses for \"http\" scheme resources should be converted to \"https\" scheme accesses, with implication that the client should expect to get the same resource back from the modified query compared to the unmodified \"http\"-scheme one. While there is a caution in \u00a79.5 that: \u00a0  If this redirection would result in a loss of functionality (e.g. \u00a0  important resources that are only available on the \"http\" origin), \u00a0  the operator MUST NOT publish an HTTPS RR. but in my reading it leaves some important details as only implicit! We need to care not only about resources only available on one vs the other origin, but also about whether the translation would change the semantics of the client's request/response exchange.\u00a0 That is, whether the resources accessible by the different schemes are actually analogous (which, per the above, is not required by HTTP and is subject to the site administrator's control or in some cases other application protocols on top of HTTP used by that origin). This (mostly implicit) requirement is a potential barrier for adoption of the HTTPS RRtype, and while the precondition is very often going to be satisfied, I wanted to get a sense for whether we should make the requirement more explicit, and possibly more prominent in the document (e.g., mention it in the Introduction).\u00a0 I don't know what the right answer is, but it seems important enough to ensure that the topic receives deliberate consideration.",

I am concerned by the use of SHOULD in this document. In several places (see 1. below for what I identified as problematic SHOULDs) the document lacks text about why these are SHOULD and not MUST or MAY. I agree with John Klensin, who formulated it very clearly: If SHOULD is used, then it must be accompanied by at least one of: (1) A general description of the character of the exceptions and/or in what areas exceptions are likely to arise.\u00a0 Examples are fine but, except in plausible and rare cases, not enumerated lists. (2) A statement about what should be done, or what the considerations are, if the \"SHOULD\" requirement is not met. (3) A statement about why it is not a MUST. I also have a number of non blocking comments and questions. I will appreciate answers to my questions, to improve my understanding. If any clarification comes out of it, I hope it will help improve the document.
