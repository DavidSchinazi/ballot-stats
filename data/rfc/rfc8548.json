Why did you opt to use a weaker construction. See: https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#security-record-layer and  https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/564 . \u00a0  FIN flag set, it MUST immediately send a frame (with empty \u00a0  application data if necessary) with \"rekey = 1\". \u00a0   I don't think that the algorithm in this section necessarily works properly, because you have to handle rekeys in sequence: Frame 1 [0:999] Frame 2 [1000:1999, rekey=1] Frame 3 [2000:2999, rekey=1] Now what happens if the frames are re-ordered so you get Frame 3 and then Frame 2. You will try to decrypt Frame 3 with generation 2 and Frame 2 with generation 3, neither of which will work (though you might be able to interpret the text loosely to have you try to decrypt Frame 2 with generation 2). Note that if you were to resequence before processing, this wouldn't happen. At minimum I think some clarification is needed here. Given that you are allowing P-256 and point reuse, you should be requiring point validation. See: https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#rfc.section.4.2.8.2 https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#elliptic-curve-diffie-hellman You should probably also be requiring Curve25519 output validation. You still seem to need to specify an MTI symmetric algorithm.",
