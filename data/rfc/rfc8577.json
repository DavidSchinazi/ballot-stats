I think that not defining the mechanism in this document is ok -- but not having one means that important parts of this specification can't work.\u00a0 Please point at where such a mechanism is specified, or at least provide examples.\u00a0  The Shepherd's writeup says that \"implementation plans and implementations\" are known so I think that this should be an easy point to address.",
