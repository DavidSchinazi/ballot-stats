Assuming that's actually done, does figure 1 here indicate a weakening of security since it shows that IP encapsulation is used between MAG-UP and LMA-UP without any mention of IPsec. Is that downgrading security? I get that the binding messages are the most important and will presumably continue on the control plane but what else changes? (2) How does the rest of the Internet know to use the LMA-UP for the MN and not the LMA-CP?
