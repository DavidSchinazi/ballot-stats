I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric == DISCUSS == -- Section 2.1 -- I support Erik Kline's COMMENT on this and am raising it to a blocking DISCUSS. A/ in all the discussion in the last \u00a7, a AAAA would have the same benefit when compared to a NS QTYPE. Or what did I miss ? B/ the last two sentences \"Another potential benefit...happy eyeballs query for the A QTYPE.\" are puzzling as using A QTYPE will actually only cache the A answer for the minimized request and more and more Internet users are using IPv6 nowadays (and possibly even more recursive DNS servers). Hence, I would welcome some discussion in the last \u00a7 about the benefit of using A QTYPE rather than AAAA QTYPE and, as suggested by Erik Kline, please remove the last 2 sentences.",
