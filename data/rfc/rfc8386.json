I'm somewhat surprised at how much this document glosses over the (sometimes extensive) broadcast/multicast twiddling that Access Points and similar do (a fair bit of discussion of which can be found in  draft-perkins-intarea-multicast-ieee802  (which I think will be expiring) or  draft-mcbride-mboned-wifi-mcast-problem-statement ).  Simply saying: \"A feature not uncommonly found on access points e.g. is to filter broadcast and multicast traffic.\u00a0 This will potentially break certain applications or some of their functionality but will also protect the users from potentially leaking sensitive information.\" seems to be shrugging off all of the privacy benefits (or possibly harms) that this might create.",
