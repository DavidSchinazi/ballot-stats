My undesrtanding is that it's normal operation for an ABR to distribution information about prefixes and such between areas, and in particular that an ABR does not necessarily need to know the semantic details of every bit of information being distributed in that fashion. So, I am imagining a scenario where some routers in both areas advertise/understand the ELC flag but the ABR between them does not implement this spec.\u00a0 What would happen in such a scenario?\u00a0 If the ABR is still expected to distribute the ELC setting without change, isn't that just a core requirement from the respective OSPF specs, as opposed to a new requirement imposed by this spec (which, in this scenario, the ABR is not claiming to adhere to anyway)? There is perhaps a similar question about the ASBR guidance, though when doing cross-protocol signalling there is a more clear need for the ASBR to understand the semantics of the flags it is redistributing (and it's only a \"SHOULD\").",
