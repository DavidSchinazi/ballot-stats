Sections of this document propose \"some techniques\" which might inform a future protocol design, while others are very specific about terminating bytes and so on. Some of these objections might not apply depending on the answer. (S2.2)  RFC9116  defines the \"Canonical\" field as \"the canonical URIs where the 'security.txt' file is located, which is usually something like ' https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt' . Obviously you do not mean that this field should be the location of that file! But maybe you mean the \"probing.txt\" file instead, as that is the well-known name. But then the example has \"measurement.txt\"? Is this an intentional difference, or the result of an incomplete revision? (S4) Is this meant to be an exhaustive list of transports for the URI, or are they examples?",

        "text": "I have a few issues I would like to further discuss. This document suggests the best method for getting probe information is to use the content of the PTR record to fire of a web request. Unfortunately, anyone who controls their own  in-addr.arpa  zone can but whatever they want in their PTR record. Eg I could probe using 193.110.157.66 and give it the PTR of  victim.com . Then I start scanning the internet, causing lots of queries to  victim.com . This can be abused as both an amplification factor and as a method to hide my IP from  victim.com 's webserver. If you have the resources to run a large scale probe from your own IP address, you can run a webserver on that IP address (and/or portforward/NAT it your favourite CDN). I suggest removing the suggestion of looking up the PTR record and explicitly state to MUST NOT use the PTR record for anything but logging purposes. Section 4 is missing guidance on HTTP based probes, which can (SHOULD?) use HTTP headers to share their information. I also feel the rest of Section 4 might not work well in practice. Inlining the probe data is usually not possible if probing for specific TCP or UDP based protocols - and surely not \"must start at the first octet\". But even if it is, and for ICMP/ICMPv6 and HTTP based probes as well, it would reveal who is sending the probe. That could influence the results. Eg one might want to block any probes from commercial entities that don't reimburse, competitors, unfriendly nation states, etc. So in practice, I doubt this is a feasible suggestion. Not even with \"If the Probe Description URI cannot be placed at the beginning of the payload, then it must be preceded by an octet of 0x00\". And lastly: \u00a0 \u00a0  Note: using a magic string (i.e., a unique special opaque marker) to signal the presence of the Probe Description URI is not recommended as some \u00a0 \u00a0  transit nodes could apply a different processing for packets containing this magic string. But the probe URI is already a \"magic string\". \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is expected that only researchers with good intentions will use these techniques No. Attackers will also use it to appear as good researchers, even point specifically at those researchers to try and blend in. This is the exact same problem as security.txt. It is just never really trustable. The only thing that can be trusted is the IP address, combined with WHOIS information (and specifically not  in-addr.arpa  zone content) \u00a0 \u00a0  If a recipient cannot confirm the information or does not wish to do so, it should treat the flows as if there were no probe attribution. This would basically cover every single probe case except the http://probe.ip.address/.well-known/probing.txt case. And even that one could be questionable since a compromised network used for probing could pretend to be Honest Achmed Security Research \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the Probe Description URI is transmitted in the clear and as the Probe Description File is publicly readable, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 should not be used for email address and phone number; a generic / group email address and phone number should be preferred. Why does this matter? The published probing.txt contains the information already, so it should be considered publicly leaked already. (Ironically, scanners will indeed go looking for /.well-known/probing.txt and use the contact info for fishing attacks etc.) The Security Considerations also does not contain a warning that the Probe URI might in fact be a honeypot / malicious target, trying to cause any browser visiting it to be compromised. Or be otherwise malicious (eg hooked to /dev/random) As I said about security.txt, I think probing.txt is also a bad idea. Let's have a discussion on this.
