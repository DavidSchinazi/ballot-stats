Section 7.1 imposes a requirement that \"[i]terative resolvers [...] MUST be configured to behave for these names either: (a) [...], or (b) [...]\".\u00a0 There is no default choice given in the absence of configuration, and it is unclear who this requirement is binding on in any case.\u00a0 Do all iterative resolvers necessarily have a human operator that knows they are responsible for the configuration of the resolver? Is the software author responsible for providing \"default configuration\" to meet this requirement?\u00a0 Let's discuss how this requirement is intended to apply and whether that is achievable in practice.\u00a0 (One of the elided portions from the above quote is \"commplying with this specification\", so perhaps the iterative recursive resolver softwares in question would be implemented to ignore this specification in the absence of such a configuration, as strange as that might seem.)",
