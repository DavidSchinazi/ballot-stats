I don't think it is easy for IANA to do that. This document is obsoleting  RFC 4447 , which means that there is no need to ever read  RFC 4447  in order to implement this document. For that reason, you should copy and paste content of the original  RFC 4447 's IANA Considerations into this document. After that, add a sentence saying that the only change is updating references to point to this document.",

Back in 1998 (18 years ago!)  RFC 2385  included an IESG note that says: \"This document describes current existing practice for securing BGP against certain simple attacks.\u00a0 It is understood to have security weaknesses against concerted attacks.\" And all these years later we can still do no better when promoting a document to IS.\u00a0 Sigh. However, I see no point in trying to block this document on that basis.  I would argue for an IESG note along the above lines if I thought that'd have any impact, but I guess it won't if, as seems to be the case, people won't move until there's a catastrophic break.",
