I think SHOULD would be fine, or, even better, something about \"SHOULD, with optional implementation specific rate-limiting\" or something. The current text makes it sound like it's perfectly fine to just not bother implementing any sort of reporting / response handing after dropping the packet.  I think that this should be an easy fix and not hold up the document (much or at all)",
