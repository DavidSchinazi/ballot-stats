I had balloted Discuss based on section 17,\u00a0 IAB Considerations, which starts out \u00a0  The IAB has mandated that protocols developed for this purpose \u00a0  document a specific set of considerations.\u00a0  I pointed out that the IAB's UNSAF RFC ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3424 ) is Informational, and I didn't think that the IAB could mandate what IETF specifications must contain.  As best as I can tell, the IAB hasn't been able to mandate what IETF protocols do for nearly 20 years. There's nothing in the IAB charter ( RFC 2850 ) beyond \"oversight of the standards process\", and the IAB isn't given a role in approving IETF documents beyond acting as the body that hears appeals of IESG decisions in  RFC 2026 . Gonzalo Salgueiro pointed out that this text also appears in  RFC 5389 , so this DISCUSS is perhaps better suited for a 5389bis draft effort or an erratum filed against  RFC 5389 . I think it's also wrong in  RFC 5389 , and I agree with Gonzalo that I should be filing an errata against  RFC 5389 , so there's that, but I don't think it's OK to publish another draft with the same incorrect text, just because it already appears in a published RFC. Given that we're having a conversation about IESG-IAB scope on some topic about every three weeks, we have five sitting ADs who have served on the IAB and both the IAB chair and IAB liaison to the IESG are former ADs, I would love to hear from other ADs about how I should handle this Discuss :-)",
