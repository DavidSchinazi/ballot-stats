Furthermore, discussion of actual privacy issues -- affecting individuals -- is missing.  Just as the document notes the corporate confidentiality issues, it should note the potential privacy issues, e.g., by adding something along the following lines: \"For any battery-powered device whose use can be correlated to an individual or a small group of individuals, the following objects have the potential to reveal information about those individuals' activities or habits (e.g., if they are near a power outlet, if they've been using their devices heavily, etc.): batteryChargingCycleCount batteryLastChargingCycleTime batteryChargingOperState batteryActualCharge batteryActualVoltage batteryActualCurrent batteryTemperature batteryAlarmLowCharge batteryAlarmLowVoltage batteryAlarmLowCapacity batteryAlarmHighCycleCount batteryAlarmHighTemperature batteryAlarmLowTemperature Implementors of this specification should use appropriate privacy protections as discussed in Section 9 of  RFC 6988 .

Can you please explain why a SHOULD and not a MUST? 4. There are 3 EMAN MIB modules on the IESG this week.

Security Considerations \u00a0  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module \u00a0  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.\u00a0 Such objects may be \u00a0  considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.\u00a0 The \u00a0  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper \u00a0  protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\u00a0 These \u00a0  are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability: For consistency with the other EMAN drafts, and the new boilerplate, this should be changed to\u00a0 \"open devices to attack\" Also, in the other 2 EMAN drafts, the following paragraph has been added: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  sensitive information about individuals' activities and habits. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Implementors of this specification should use appropriate \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  privacy protections as discussed in Section 9 of  RFC 6988  and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  monitoring of individuals and homes should only occur with \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  proper authorization. You have inserted (to address this point): \u00a0  Implementers SHOULD use appropriate privacy protections.\u00a0 Battery \u00a0  monitoring of devices used by individuals SHOULD only occur with \u00a0  proper authorization.\u00a0 See the relevant discussion in Section 9 of \u00a0  the Requirements for Energy Management [ RFC6988 ]. Shouldn't we be consistent between the 3 EMAN docs? See  http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-eman-energy-aware-mib-17.txt  for the diff",

        "text": "I've been concerned since the requirements document came out, and mentioned it again when the framework document came out, that this WG has not taken seriously energy management that is beyond the realm of very small devices with very small power consumption and a limited kind of battery bank. This MIB is a clear indication to me that the WG still has not taken larger more complicated systems into account. I am not an expert on these systems; I know a limited amount from the work I do with renewable energy systems. But there are obvious omissions from this MIB that make me believe that the WG did little research into the needs of systems that I am sure would be using this kind of MIB. I have below some additions that I think are obviously missing, but I think it is worth some research to find out if there are other features missing. (If MIBs are sufficiently extensible in current management systems that the following can be added later without causing disruption, then I'm happy to clear my DISCUSS if these things can be added later with ease. But I fear things may get locked-in in ways that will make it difficult to add in the future.) 3.1: Some battery characteristics that seem obviously missing from the list: - Recharge voltage: The low voltage at which the battery should be recharged, independent of raising an alarm - Equalization voltage: The voltage to be held for the equalization portion of the charging cycle  - Bulk voltage: The voltage to rise to during the bulk stage of the charging cycle before transitioning to absorption - Absorb voltage: The voltage to be held for the absorption stage of the charging cycle - Float voltage: The voltage to be held by the charger after charging is complete - Absorb time: The time to spend in the absorption portion of the charging cycle - Temperature compensation: The value by which to change the charging voltage per degree based on the battery temperature These are features of batteries that a charger must know about in order to properly charge them, and they are characteristics that are specified by the battery manufacturer. These are all read-only. Some of them *might* be a range of acceptable values, so there might need to be some accommodation for that too. Also, adding a notification for *high* battery voltage seems important. 3.2: Why are the three types of lead-acid batteries -- Flooded, Gel, and Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) -- not separated out as different types? Those types of batteries have very different charging characteristics, which a charging system is going to want to retrieve so that it can properly handle the battery, and they should have separate entries. The following are concerns I have with items in the current MIB: 4: What is the difference between batteryActualCharge and batteryActualCapacity? When could these values be different? (Similarly with the alarms that distinguish between the two.) The charging states (unknown(1), charging(2), fastCharging(3), maintainingCharge(4), noCharging(5), discharging(6)) and associated other data relating to charging states seems a bit odd. They appear more to be states of the charger than states of the battery. Many batteries don't \"know\" whether they are being charged vs. fast-charged vs. maintenance charged. If we are going to start introducing charger states into what the battery MIB, I think charge states like \"absorbing charge\", \"bulk charge\", and \"equalizing charge\" might also make sense. But this seems like a weird road to go down.",

My conclusion is that energy generation systems (solar, wind, or nuclear and coal for that matter) are out of scope for EMAN generally, and batteries used in such systems are out of sope for the battery MIB. I'm a bit disappointed by that, but I won't object to the document if that is the intent of the WG. However, if that is true, it really needs to be said in the introduction to this document, and likely should be even more explicit in the applicability statement document. I suggest inserting the following paragraph in section 1, just before the discussion of UPS devices. (Feel free to edit.) \u00a0  Specifically out of scope for this document are batteries that are \u00a0  part of energy generation systems. Such systems, whether they are \u00a0  off-grid power generation systems (e.g., solar, wind, fuel-cell) that \u00a0  maintain their own storage or traditional small- or large-scale \u00a0  generators (anything from microgenerators to utility-scale power \u00a0  plants), have much different monitoring and control interfaces to \u00a0  their battery systems than those of the type of network-attached \u00a0  devices that this document is trying to support.
