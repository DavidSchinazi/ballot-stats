IANA has examined the ports registry and can see the registration but no link to an I-D or RFC.

        "text": "I found this document very well-written and will ballot \"Yes\" once I get a few points clarified. 1. I am surprised that this draft specifically disallows IGMPv1.\u00a0 Is there some rationale for that? 2. In section 4.1.2.2, there is a use case described as a proxy.\u00a0 How does an AMT proxy relate to the standard IGMP/MLD proxy defined in  RFC 4605  (it is in the normative reference list, but not actually referenced).\u00a0 It appears to be the same functionality with new rules for the upstream interface.\u00a0 It would be nice to see some clarifications in this draft on that relationship.\u00a0 And if there is a tight relationship when operating in this mode, what affect does that have on the gateway needing to generate query messages? 3. Section 4.2.1.2 makes no statement about the version of the IGMP/MLD queries sent by the relays.\u00a0 Later sections mandate the sending of IGMPv3 or MLDv2 queries.\u00a0 Why is there a restriction on the version of the queries?\u00a0 Given that the relays are acting as IGMP/MLD Queries, should there also be discussion as to relaxation of the rules for compatibility modes? 4. Sections 4.2.1.3 and 5.3.3.5 seem to disagree on whether AMT relays must handle TEARDOWN messages.\u00a0 I suspect that 4.2.1.3 needs to be revised to be consistent with the normative description in 5.3.3.5. 5. Do AMT gateways need to perform any type of RPF check before forwarding packets received via an AMT Multicast Data message, especially when functioning as a proxy? 6. Sections 5.1.2.5 and 5.3.1 indicate that AMT can carry IPv6 payloads encapsulated in IPv4 packets and vice versa.\u00a0 However, there is no discussion on the implications of doing such address family mixing, especially during the relay discovery process.\u00a0 I recall having discussions about this in mboned and the consensus seemed to be to disallow the mixing of address families.",

The current AMT protocol has these DISCUSS issues that must be addressed: 1) lack of congestion control of the AMT traffic between relay and gateway \u00a0 -- Then tunnel multicast traffic can exceed a path's capacity. Further, such a relay will send out a number of tunnelled multicast flows to a huge number of destinations, either competing with themselves or with other flows.  2) lack of MTU handling \u00a0 -- There absolutely no mentioning of MTU issues in the draft. However, tunnelled packets can easily exceed the path MTU. How does AMT react to this? 3) Use of zero IPv6/UDP checksum and failure handling, if any middlebox enroute is not allowing zero UDP checksum packets to traverse. This is also a question on what happens, if the traffic is black holed for any other reasons, i.e., when no ICMP error message is returned at all.  4) Security: There is a change in the threat model, i.e., multicast requires LAN access but with AMT almost anybody can access the multicast feed. I can understand that this is not needed in certain deployments, e.g., a mobile phone network, but this is not well documented in any part of the draft.  5) NAT traversal and the IANA-assigned port.  Section 4.2.2.2 assumes a simple NAPT with translation from IPv4 to IPv4.

        "text": "I am moving to Abstain, as some issues have been addressed, namely 2 and 3 (partly), but others such as 1) are not addressed and will probably not be solved by this draft.  I still do not see that this protocol is safe for operations across the public Internet, as the major point 1) isn't solved.  Therefore, I would appreciate very much to emphasize the point \"- Limit the scope of this to wallened gardens and adding operational consinderations describing the limits of it.\" *************************************** The old DISCUSS as reference: I have no general objection to the AMT protocol as such, but the below DISCUSS issues.  The overall description of the protocol and its framework is well done.  The current AMT protocol has these DISCUSS issues that must be addressed: 1) lack of congestion control of the AMT traffic between relay and gateway \u00a0 -- Then tunnel multicast traffic can exceed a path's capacity. Further, such a relay will send out a number of tunnelled multicast flows to a huge number of destinations, either competing with themselves or with other flows.  2) lack of MTU handling \u00a0 -- There absolutely no mentioning of MTU issues in the draft. However, tunnelled packets can easily exceed the path MTU. How does AMT react to this? 3) Use of zero IPv6/UDP checksum and failure handling, if any middlebox enroute is not allowing zero UDP checksum packets to traverse. This is also a question on what happens, if the traffic is black holed for any other reasons, i.e., when no ICMP error message is returned at all.  4) Security: There is a change in the threat model, i.e., multicast requires LAN access but with AMT almost anybody can access the multicast feed. I can understand that this is not needed in certain deployments, e.g., a mobile phone network, but this is not well documented in any part of the draft.  5) NAT traversal and the IANA-assigned port.  Section 4.2.2.2 assumes a simple NAPT with translation from IPv4 to IPv4. However there can be other NATs than even change the source IP address for incoming flows and potentially also the port number. Is there any specific reason to nail down the source port of the relay? The discovery mechanism could also return an arbitrary port number.  6) Section 5.2.3.5.4, start of page 58: NAT timer. The NAT timer is independent of any other time, as this really depends on the NAT on the path.  7) The current AMT specification cuts away the possibility to return ASM receiver feedback to the source. This is not documented nor described.
