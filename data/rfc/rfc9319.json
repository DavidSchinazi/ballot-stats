In Section 1, I see the following:  Each ROA contains a set of IP prefixes, and an AS number of \u00a0  an AS authorized to originate all the IP prefixes in the set \u00a0  [ RFC6482 ]. While I have some idea of what this means - it's confusing and I believe will cause confusion on the part of other readers.\u00a0 It's confusing to the point where I'm not even sure exactly what the wording should be, but reading that, an AS number of an AS doesn't seem right at all. Let's discuss and see if we can find a way to come to text on this section that is less confusing. Thanks Andrew",
