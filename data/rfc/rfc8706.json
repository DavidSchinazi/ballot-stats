(We will still need to change this text to reflect reality, though.) It's also unclear to me if we need to give more description of the behavior when a router planning to restart does not receive (all) the necessary PAs -- does it cancel the planned restart?\u00a0 Fall back to the regular RR usage? It looks like there's an internal inconsistency between Section 3.2 (\"[w]hen transmitting a TLV multiple flags MUST NOT be set.\") and Section 3.3.2 (\"the IIH is retransmitted with both RR and SA bits set\").",
