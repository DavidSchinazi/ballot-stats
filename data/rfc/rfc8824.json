Similarly, Section 5.4 says that size1 and size2 are unidirectional (only in requests), which does not seem to be accurate given my reading of RFCs 7252 and 7599. I also think that we need some further discussion (e.g., in the security considerations) about how the base LPWAN SCHC document assumes that MAC-layer LPWAN security mechanisms are in use, but that CoAP is not restricted to such contexts.\u00a0 What additional security considerations are relevant when this compression is used for CoAP without LPWAN MAC-layer cryptographic protection? Perhaps not really a Discuss on this document, but what is the planned disposition of the tsv-art reviewer's comments regarding draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc  and UDP Options?\u00a0 I did not see anything pertinent in the mailarchive.",

While the expanded security considerations do cover several important points, I think it's important to specifically state that the  RFC 8724 procedures assume that SCHC is implemented on top of LPWAN technologies that implement security mechanisms.\u00a0 I think we also need to specify that either (a) this assumption remains for the CoAP usage of SCHC, or that (b) CoAP has use cases outside of LPWAN, and when SCHC is used in those non-LPWAN cases, the attacks (such as are now described in the -15) are more readily performed than in the secure LPWAN environment when no other integrity protection mechanism is in place for the compressed packets. As Francesca noted on the -13, we need to acknowledge that there are and will be in the future CoAP options that are not included in this document and provide some indication of how they might be handled. Whether that's to define new compression rules/guidance for them, always send them as full residuals, or some other behavior can be decided in the future on a per-option basis, but we can give some guidance here on how we plan to support extensibility of options. --- The -15 introduced some new text in the Introduction: \u00a0  CoAP is an End-to-End protocol at the application level, so CoAP \u00a0  compression requires to install common Rules between two hosts and IP It's not entirely clear to me that this is true, given that CoAP proxies are a first-class protocol feature.\u00a0 OSCORE is probably fair to describe as end-to-end, but CoAP itself may not be. Also, the new examples in Section 2 are sufficiently hard to follow that I can't be sure the figures and the prose descriptions are internally consistent.\u00a0 (See COMMENT for a few more specifics.)",

        "text": "Reviewing this document and its application to compress case two and three stacks in Figure 1, i.e. with some end-to-end encryption appears to significantly change an assumption from the SCHC for IPv6/UDP. Namely, the assumption about context establishment. In normal SCHC the contexts are established between the Device and the NGW. In these end-to-end encrypted case the context establishing party for the COAP compression is the APP and the APP layer in the device. This difference appear completely ignored in this document. I think this is a significant difference as having the device and NGW run a protocol for establishing context over the L2 or L3 with the local context knowledge is fairly straightforward. However, in this case when the COAP peer on the internet side of the NGW this determination and configuration is a different matter.  From my perspective some more discussion of the fact that this is a different context and that it have different challenges in establishing the context should be made clear in the document.",
