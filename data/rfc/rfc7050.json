Otherwise, you need to replace all occurrences of \u00a0  ipv4only.arpa  by FQDN-TBD and have the RFC Editor insert the \u00a0 IANA-assigned FQDN. \u00a0 (3) The same thing applies to 192.0.0.170 and 192.0.0.171. Either \u00a0 they need to be IP-ADDR-TBD1 and IP-ADDR-TBD2 in the text, or you \u00a0 need an explicit request to IANA. \u00a0 (4) Who populates the DNS with the RRs for  ipv4only.arpa?

Why is it ok to leave this to folklore? In the DANE protocol [1] we added a paragraph that said: \"This document does not specify how DNSSEC validation occurs because there are many different proposals for how a client might get validated DNSSEC results, such as from a DNSSEC-aware resolver that is coded in the application, from a trusted DNSSEC resolver on the machine on which the application is running, or from a trusted DNSSEC resolver with which the application is communicating over an authenticated and integrity-protected channel or network.\u00a0 This is described in more detail in Section 7 of [ RFC4033 ].\" Would something like that work here? While it is a bit weasel-wordy, I think its better than being as vague as the current draft on this  aspect. \u00a0  [1]  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698#section-1.3 (2) 3.1.2, step 3: I can't envisage any sensible way in which the node could query the user. If there is such a way, then I think you really ought describe that (non-normatively) here (or in an appendix) since in the case of web and email PKIs, developers have so far always failed to ask correct and understandable questions of users and that has generated bad user behaviour (to just click on \"ok\" when asked a stupid question). If nobody can think of a sensible way to query the user, then the MAY here has got to be wrong but since you put it in, I assume you do have ideas for what to ask so this should be easily sorted.",
