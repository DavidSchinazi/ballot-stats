I have one issue with the text of 6.1 though that I think needs fixing before we can proceed. I'll state that in the form of an OLD/NEW suggestion in case that just works: OLD: \t\u00a0  This specification is thus published as experimental, in order to\t  \t\u00a0  encourage its use and reports of its use.\u00a0 Once experiments have been\t  \t\u00a0  carried out and reported, it is intended to advance this\t  \t\u00a0  specification, with any changes identified by such experimentation,\t  \t\u00a0  to standards track. NEW: \t\u00a0  This specification is thus published as experimental, in order to\t  \t\u00a0  encourage its use and reports on its use.\u00a0 Once experiments have been\t  \t\u00a0  carried out and reported, and when some public analysis of the underlying  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  cryptographic algorithms is available, it may be appropriate\u00a0 to advance this\t  \t\u00a0  specification, with any changes identified by such experimentation and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  analysis, to standards track. My reasoning is as follows: the main problem (I see) with this being on the standards track is the total lack of public analysis of the signature  algorithm.

I do think the text you've used in -05 could be improved still though, you say that \"it is intended\" to promote this to the standards track, but, while that is of course a good intention for the authors, I do not think that the IETF can be said to have that intention - whether or not that'll happen will depend on the experiment surely and the IETF is not making promises about that. So I'd prefer if you had said \"it may be appropriate\" instead, as suggested below. But I'm fine with letting whoever is the sponsoring AD handle that as it'd not be  reasonable to block an experimental RFC on just that basis. I'm also moving to an ABSTAIN on this, as I'm not convinced that  IBE is at all valuable here, given it's IMO fatal flaws in terms of inherent key escrow. That is also not a DISCUSS as a) that's my personal opinion and we don't have an IETF consensus against IBE for that reason, and b) this is experimental so even if we did have such a consensus, I'd bet it'd be limited to standards track specifications. If you do intend for this to end up on the standards track, then I'd suggest you also try to establish some IETF  consensus for when it is appropriate (if ever) for an IETF  standards-track specification to incorporate inherent key escrow. (But, I would imagine establishing such a consensus would be hard, if it's even possible.) --- OLD DISCUSS BELOW My main discuss point on -02 of this was: (1) I am concerned that  RFC6507  may not be ready for use in standards-track RFCs.

I've also not seen any MANET list discussion of that aspect (and indeed the MANET list discussion I did see seems to involve very few people).\u00a0 I asked on the CFRG list about  RFC6507  and it seems [1] to be the case that no-one has so far really evaluated its security, other than folks associated with the author's institution. (Which applies to both 6507 and this I think.) I also didn't find any references to 6507 in Google scholar.\u00a0 Lastly, I think we should be, and be seen to be, more careful than usual with this draft - given the situation with DUAL-EC-DRBG, and that this is a new signature scheme that allows the KMS to fake anyone's signature and the author involved.\u00a0 Note that that last is not any imputation of misbehaviour, but the IETF would not be\u00a0 doing due-dilligence if we didn't explicitly consider that aspect. \u00a0 [1]  https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/cfrg/current/msg05540.html The authors have added section 6.1 and changed the intended status to experimental which does almost entirely resolve the above. I have one issue with the text of 6.1 though that I think needs fixing before we can proceed. I'll state that in the form of an OLD/NEW suggestion in case that just works: OLD: \t\u00a0  This specification is thus published as experimental, in order to\t  \t\u00a0  encourage its use and reports of its use.\u00a0 Once experiments have been\t  \t\u00a0  carried out and reported, it is intended to advance this\t  \t\u00a0  specification, with any changes identified by such experimentation,\t  \t\u00a0  to standards track. NEW: \t\u00a0  This specification is thus published as experimental, in order to\t  \t\u00a0  encourage its use and reports on its use.\u00a0 Once experiments have been\t  \t\u00a0  carried out and reported, and when some public analysis of the underlying  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  cryptographic algorithms is available, it may be appropriate\u00a0 to advance this\t  \t\u00a0  specification, with any changes identified by such experimentation and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  analysis, to standards track. My reasoning is as follows: the main problem (I see) with this being on the standards track is the total lack of public analysis of the signature  algorithm. That is not fixed via usage or reports of usage. -- OLD COMMENTS BELOW The text below were additional discuss points.  While I'm ok with these not being specified in an experimental  RFC, I think the absence of those bits of specification means  that this is clearly not a complete spec that'd allow interop.  (So that would need to be fixed before trying to get this back on  the standards track.) The text does now at least ack that the  revocation trick or some equivalent is needed, but fails to  specify a concrete way of doing that. And while the authors don't agree with me that private key provisioning needs to be specified in an interoperable manner, I think that if one was to produce any IBC standard that has to be a part of the work, otherwise nodes are limited to working with a KMS in a proprietary fashion, which is a kind of vendor lockin. The old discuss points are below. I think this would be better if these issues were also called out in section 6.1 but I'll not block on that basis. Perhaps the responsible AD might think about whether that really needs to be mentioned or not. (2) How does a router get its private key? Why is it ok to not specify that? Seems like an interop fail if that is not done. (4) 4.1: The usual revocation trick of including a time value in the name is referred to at the end of this section but without sufficient detail to allow interop. Why is that ok?",
