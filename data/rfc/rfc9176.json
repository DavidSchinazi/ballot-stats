        "text": "I agree with Roman that the authorization model seems under-developed. While I recognize that there is need for flexibility across various deployments, I think that we should be providing a default model (and procedures for it) that will apply in many cases, and let deployments specify alternate models if needed.\u00a0 This stuff is hard enough to get right that we should have a secure option that people can use if they don't need to have customized details.\u00a0 (To be clear, I agree with the change of focus from -24 to -25 on the properties that a security policy needs to provide and/or consider, as that is fundamentally the important thing.\u00a0 I just want a fallback/default option that \"does something reasonable in most cases\" in addition. Doing that by reference to some other existing thing would be fine, if such a thing exists.) In particular, the current text seems to rely on the authorization model including: (1) the RD knowing how clients will be using it (and thus what properties the RD needs to enforce), which in the general case cannot be known (though for static networks it could be), yet I don't see any discussion that indicates this as a prerequisite; and (2) the client either knowing out-of-band that an entity is authorized to act as a RD or just blindly trusting any of the unauthenticated (*) advertisement mechanisms.\u00a0 (* Yes, there may be some protection in the network on subscribing to the relevant multicast address, DNS-SD, etc., but the client cannot a priori know that such protections are in place.) Relatedly, the naming model and naming authority should have some clearer discussion.\u00a0 We do mention in Section 7 the possibility for a weak naming model where the RD is responsible for enforcing uniqueness of names but otherwise link attributes are the primary authorization criteria (vs. a traditional scheme with a naming authority and naming hierarchy), but with naming as a fundamental prerequisite of any authentication/authorization scheme, I think clearer discussion of how a naming model is to be selected (and, perhaps more importantly, that it must be fixed as part of a given deployment) for a given network is needed. If I understand correctly, we have some codepoint squatting going on in the examples (e.g., for resource types). We should talk about the security properties of the various RD discovery mechanisms that are defined.",

I am little puzzled by the document shepherd's write-up dated more than one year ago (the responsible AD has even changed and the change is not reflected in the write-up)... while well-written this write-up seems to indicate neither a large consensus nor a deep interest by the CORE WG community. But, I am trusting the past and current responsible ADs on this aspect. Did the authors check with 6MAN WG about the new RDAO option for IPv6 NDP ? I was unable to find any 6MAN email related to this new NDP option and, after checking with the 6MAN WG chairs, they also do not remember any discussion. BTW, I appreciated the use of ASCII art to represent an entity-relationship diagram ! Please find below a couple of non-blocking COMMENTs (and I would appreciate a reply to each of my COMMENTs) and 2 blocking DISCUSS points (but only trivial actions/fixes are required). I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric == DISCUSS == -- Section 4.1 -- It will be trivial to fix, in IPv6 address configuration (SLAAC vs. DHCP) is orthogonal to DHCP 'other-information'. E.g., even if address is configured via SLAAC, DHCPv6 other-information can be used to configure the Recursive DNS Server (or possibly the RD). -- Section 4.1.1 -- Another trivial DISCUSS to fix: in which message is this RDAO sent ?
