There's something weird here. If \"id\" is (or can be) arbitrary binary data, then encoding it \"as octets according to the UTF-8 character encoding\" and then percent encoding it is going to be a really bad idea. Seems to me that if it's arbitrary binary, you should encode the \"id\" in BASE64 or something first, or at least be clear in the above that only *textual* data is first encoded in UTF-8, and then percent-encode, except for \"id\" for which you should percent-encode everything. Is there any other non-textual data that might appear in this URI? Further down: \u00a0  Note that if a URI does carry \u00a0  characters outside of the US-ASCII character set a conversion to an \u00a0  Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) defined in [ RFC3987 ] may \u00a0  be considered. As mentioned on the IETF list, please strike this sentence. The use of IRIs as protocol elements is recipe for disaster. I think we came to the conclusion long ago that if you are using something as a protocol element, it had better be a URI, and you had better percent-encode anything that was non-US-ASCII. Normalization is discussed quite reasonably in 3986; 3987 is unlikely to add anything useful, and 3987 is currently in a state of limbo anyway: We're waiting to see what W3C ends up recommending for HTML5, and the IETF is likely to end up referencing that in the long run and not 3987. 6.
