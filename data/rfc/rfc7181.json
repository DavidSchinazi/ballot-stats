Does this cause any interoperability artifacts?\u00a0 It seems to be saying that I can consider a message invalid for any reason I decide to come up with, and therefore silently discard any message for basically any reason.\u00a0 Is that right?\u00a0 If there are some criteria or limitations relating to those additional reasons, it'd be helpful to give them.\u00a0 If it really is at a whim, how does that work?\u00a0 (I see that Section 23.2 suggests some additional reasons, but this section just seems to leave it entirely open.) I understand that this might just be a quality of implementation issue: if your router picks bogus reasons for discarding otherwise-valid messages, it'll suck and no one will use it.\u00a0 In that case, is there a way that such a rogue router could be used to attack or DoS a MANET?",

However, there is a broader question about congestion potentially caused by this which isn't addressed in the document, especially not since it is on the Standards Track.  Everything in OLSRv2 about congestion control is copied from  RFC 3626 .  RFC 3626  is Experimental,\u00a0 so far so good.  1) Is there any guidance on congestion avoidance and control that was learned from deployments of  RFC 3626 ?  2) The timers for the Message Interval Parameters (TC_INTERVAL and TC_MIN_INTERVAL) are fixed to o\u00a0 TC_INTERVAL := 5 seconds o\u00a0 TC_MIN_INTERVAL := TC_INTERVAL/4 Is there any recommendation to change the values for very low bandwidth links? Such as being used in MANETS? The point is that on very low bandwidth links the messages carrying the OSLRv2 information could already take most of the share of the available bandwidth.  3) What would be the recommendation to an OLSRv2 instance experiencing congestion? And the resulting effects for the routing.",
