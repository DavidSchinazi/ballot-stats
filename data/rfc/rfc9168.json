The concern I have is that in BGP's distribution model FlowSpecs are forwarded to other BGP speakers...which may not also be PCCs.\u00a0 If PCEP takes precedence, and the actions are different, then there might be nodes that take the BGP-defined action when not intended to...potentially resulting in unexpected forwarding or rate-limiting of the traffic. Clearly, this issue is related to the different distribution models for the information.\u00a0 If the operator took care of using BGP to distribute FlowSpecs to only the PCCs, then this issue wouldn't exist.\u00a0 I would like to see some text that provides guidance when using both distribution mechanisms.",

This is a Discuss because I want to have a discussion, not because I'm confident in the correctness of my position.\u00a0 But it seems like the ambiguity about when multiple flow specifications in single FLOWSPEC object are treated as logical AND to narrow a single flow specification versus treated as separate flow specifications per Section 8.4 could lead to confusion, and it would be simpler and have less risk to stick to the \"one flow specification per FLOWSPEC object\" model as discussed in the rest of the document.\u00a0 If the ability to define multiple flows within a single FLOWSPEC object is retained, I think we need more specific procedures for identifying when that is the case, quite possibly with a specific enumeration of cases. I also mention in the per-section comments several places where (IIUC) there seems to be a need to match the Speaker Entity Identifier TLV as well as the FS-ID value.\u00a0 It might even be an exhaustive list, but please do a pass to check.",
