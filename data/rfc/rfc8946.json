I had two other points for discussion: (1) IANA seems unhappy (the expert review identified issues).\u00a0 What's the plan to address them? (2) The following text from the Security Considerations seems inconsistent to me: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, \u00a0  including this information about forwarding is at the discretion of \u00a0  the retargeting entity, so if there is a requirement to keep the \u00a0  original called number confidential, no PASSporT should be created \u00a0  for that retargeting - the only consequence will be that downstream \u00a0  entities will be unable to correlate an incoming call with the \u00a0  original PASSporT without access to some prior knowledge of the \u00a0  policies that could have caused the retargeting. I don't understand this -- if the idea is to keep the original called number confidential, wouldn't this necessitate *not giving the original PASSporT to the called entity*, since the original PASSporT includes the original call destination?\u00a0 Without the original PASSporT at all, of course it can't be correlated to an incoming call...\u00a0 (Even in the OOB case, would the post-retargeting called entity even be able to retrieve/decrypt the original PASSporT?)\u00a0 Is this intended to only apply to some non-SIP case?",
