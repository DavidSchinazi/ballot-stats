I have a couple of questions and concerns about this: 1) I don't fully understand the expected interaction between the team and the broader community. If the team is expected to draw on the broader community, why must it be a team? That is, why can't one DE be on the hook for completing the review, as long as the instructions to the DE say that the person must consult with experts to ensure that the breadth of expertise necessary is filtered into the review? 2) My understanding is that the number of people available to be on the envisioned DE team can be counted on one hand and that number is dwindling. Do we really expect to be able to build a team with \"broad and specific skills\" given this reality? I'd rather we not setup a process that we are unlikely to be able to fulfill at the time when a review is needed. 3) What is the decisionmaking process for the DE team? What happens if the DEs on the team can't agree with each other? Do we just not do the review?",

I think the signal that this sends to potential future contributors to the IETF process is that the thanks that they may get for volunteering their time and donating their expertise is to be insulted or stereotyped or both in an immutable, archival document that we publish. If this is the consensus of the IETF, as reflected in Appendix B of this document, I want nothing to do with it. I will not be engaging further on this document. Cheers, Alissa",
