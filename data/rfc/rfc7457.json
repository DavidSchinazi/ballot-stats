        "text": "Thank you for your work on this draft!\u00a0 It looks great, but I do have two items I'd like to discuss and see if we can add text to address these concerns/attacks before switching to a yes.\u00a0  1. I think it would be very helpful to include what techniques are used by forensic tools that enable access to decrypt TLS sessions and how to respond/prevent that access.\u00a0 I see you have certificate attacks listed in 2.7, which is what the common forensic tools leverage.\u00a0 However, these tools also require access to the private key, and it would be helpful to mention the importance of protecting the private key, preventing exportability, etc..\u00a0  In 2.7 I thin it would be helpful to explicitly state that commonly used forensic tools such as wireshark require access to the private key as well as use of RSA.\u00a0 Another option might be to add the recommendation to protect the private key in 2.13.\u00a0 If you can't export the key (from an implementation perspective), that could go a long way to helping to reduce this method of exposure. I've included a few links for additional information on the list of tools and explicit details of the attack used in case this is helpful. \u00a0 Forensic tools that rely on a MiTM attack to decrypt TLS and DTLS session: \u00a0 \u00a0   http://forensicswiki.org/wiki/SSL_forensics \u00a0 Wireshark requires you have the key:  http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX116557 \u00a0 Mitigations are to protect the private key and to not use RSA: \u00a0 \u00a0   http://wirewatcher.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/decrypting-ssl-traffic-with-wireshark-and-ways-to-prevent-it/ \u00a0 \u00a0   http://wiki.wireshark.org/DTLS?highlight=%28tls%29 If you would like text suggestions, let me know and I'll help. 2. I realize this draft covers explicit attacks against TLS, however since pervasive monitoring is considered an attack, it could be helpful for this draft also cover techniques used by middle boxes to intercept TLS streams (proxy firewalls, load balancers, etc.).\u00a0 Although these are more of 'attacks' on the user, than of TLS, it could be a short addition to have this documented.\u00a0  The TLS session is intercepted, or in the case of a load balancer it might be terminated, with a second TLS session initiated to the destination allowing traffic to pass in the clear on the middlebox.\u00a0 The user is alerted and warned to accept an untrusted certificate in this process, and many do as a result of corporate restrictions (they have no choice if they want to go to that site).\u00a0  Perhaps implementation recommendations could assist here to improve the warnings to the user, letting them know their traffic may be passing in the clear and they may not want to continue with their session.\u00a0 Some may chose to avoid certain transactions from the work place as a result. If you have already discussed these items and decided they were out of scope, please let me know.\u00a0 I support this work and just wanted to make sure we covered all bases or put some out of scope.\u00a0 Thank you.",
