Is it implicit to be the commercial web site \" github.com \" ? If so, let's be clear in this first document from the GIT WG. Alternatives such as GitLab and BitBucket are only briefly mentioned.  And, I understand that the GIT charter is also quite vague on this topic and SHOULD be updated to make it clear if this document is not clear about what is \"GitHub\". The document itself is clear, easy to read, and sensible except for the unique perceived focus of \" github.com \". Finally, I cannot accept that an IETF document in 2020 proposes to use an IPv4-only web site (see also the IAB statement  https://www.iab.org/2016/11/07/iab-statement-on-ipv6  ).
