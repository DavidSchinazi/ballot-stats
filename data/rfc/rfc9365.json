Special thanks to - Carlos Bernardos for the shepherd's write-up even if a justification for the informational status would have been welcome but the WG consensus description is appreciated.  - Pascal Thubert for his IETF last call INT directorate review at:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking-20-intdir-lc-thubert-2021-06-18/  and for his IESG telechat INT directorate review  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking-27-intdir-telechat-thubert-2022-02-28/  Pascal's Last Call & telechat reviews were (at least partially) acted upon by Paul ;-) I hope that this helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric # DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ## Abstract & Section 1 \"then enumerates requirements for the extensions of those IPv6 protocols\" does not match any IPWAVE WG work item, i.e., it is outside the scope of the charter of IPWAVE WG. As the document does not explicitly specify requirements, I strongly suggest to use the word \"gaps\" rather than \"requirements\" in the abstract and section 1. ## Section 4.1 Using an IPv6 address out of a ULA prefix still requires DAD. So the text below should be updated to be corrected: \u00a0 \"their own IPv6 Unique Local Addresses \u00a0  (ULAs) [ RFC4193 ] over the wireless network, which does not require \u00a0  the messaging (e.g., Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)) of IPv6 \u00a0  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [ RFC4862 ].\" ## Section 4.2 Very similar comment as above (i.e., DAD & MLD must be done for all IPv6 addresses of an interface and not only for the global one): \u00a0 \"... When global IPv6 \u00a0  addresses are used, wireless interface configuration and control \u00a0  overhead for DAD\" ## Section 5.2 \u00a0 \"... If DHCPv6 is used to assign \u00a0  a unique IPv6 address to each vehicle in this shared link, DAD is not \u00a0  required. \" This is incorrect and must be changed (see section 18.2.10.1. of  RFC 8415 )",

        "text": "I'm not an expect on these areas of technology, but I find parts of this document to be quite uncompelling.\u00a0 However, it is an informational document, where considerable latitude is allowed. Although I'm happy for the authors to correct my misunderstandings below, if they wish, I'm doubtful that such a discussion will really be helpful, hence my abstain ballot. Some of my concerns when reviewing this document: (1) It feels like quite a lot of these problems are (or could be) solved today using the existing wireless networks and GPS already included in cars.\u00a0 E.g., presumably they are already making use of IP over 4G-LTE without needing these proposed protocol changes?\u00a0 I.e., how many of the problems described here can really be most efficiently solved by having a local dynamic network? (2) Having some sort of bitcoin/blockchain based micropayment scheme for sharing sensor data between vehicles feels highly implausible to me, given that the world hasn't seemed to manage a micropayment scheme for websites which seems like an easier problem to solve. (3) Would vehicles even be able to safely trust sensor data coming from other vehicles?\u00a0 E.g., hacked vehicles that randomly occasionally inject false sensor readings.\u00a0 Who would have legal liability if your vehicle takes some action based on unreliable 3rd party sensor data?\u00a0 I appreciate that it outside this type of technical document, but I think that it limits the likely hood of solving this in an ad hoc network. (4) I struggle to understand how the V2X use cases really work.\u00a0 In a street (at least in the UK) there would often be people in very close proximity to a vehicle (e.g., walking on the pavement [sidewalk] next to a vehicle, and presumably it is only people in front of the vehicle that are potential collision problems, and for these cases, are radar/lidar/cameras/sensors not a more robust choice (and are already deployed today, and seemingly improving every year).\u00a0 I would think that the only way that this could work with a smartphone is if it sharing very precise (0.1 m) location data all the time to everything around it, which would probably degrade the battery and would also seem to have some serious privacy considerations. (5) In Appendix D, I don't understand how the AERO/OMNI service solves the MTU problem.\u00a0 It seems to be just introducing another layer to solve exactly the problem that are already solved by existing transport layer protocols.\u00a0 If there is some data illustrating how TCP over OAL (with IP parcels) is more efficient that straight TCP over IP then that would be worth sharing.

(1) The Privacy Considerations are under-specified: (1.a) [per -28] Section 6.3 suggests the needs for logging, \u201cTo deal with this kind of security issue, for monitoring suspicious behaviors, vehicles' communication activities can be recorded in either a central way through a logging server (e.g., TCC) in the vehicular cloud or a distributed way (e.g., blockchain [Bitcoin]) along with other vehicles or infrastructure.\u00a0 To solve the issue ultimately, we need a solution where, without\u00a0 \u00a0 privacy breakage, \u2026\u201d.\u00a0 Some discussion on the \u201cprivacy breakage\u201d is needed.\u00a0 What exactly would be the trade offs between a centralized vs. distributed log?\u00a0 Who would get to see this information?\u00a0 What is sensitive about this information? From -29: \u00a0  Alternatively, for \u00a0  completely secure vehicular networks, we shall embrace the concept of \u00a0  \"zero-trust\" for vehicles in which no vehicle is trustable and \u00a0  verifying every message (such as IPv6 control messages including ND, \u00a0  DAD, NUD, and application layer messages) is necessary.\u00a0 In this way, \u00a0  a failure to prevent a cyberattack shall never happen on a vehicular \u00a0  network.\u00a0 Thus, we need to have an efficient zero-trust framework or \u00a0  mechanism for vehicular networks. I\u2019m speculating that the second from last sentence, \u201c[i]n this way, a failure to prevent a cyberattack shall never happen on a vehicular network\u201d was added to partially respond to the above feedback.\u00a0 Saying that an attack will \u201cnever\u201d success due to a zero-trust framework is not plausible.\u00a0 Could this please rephrased. (1.b) [per -28] Section 3.3 notes a V2P use case where the pedestrian\u2019s smart-phone is sharing unspecified information.\u00a0 Does that include location information?\u00a0 Who gets it?\u00a0 What kind of identifiers are shared? Thanks for adding the following text -29: \u00a0  The location information of a VRU from a smart device is multicasted \u00a0  only to the nearby vehicles.\u00a0 The true identifiers of a VRU's \u00a0  smartphone shall be protected, and only the type of the VRU, such as \u00a0  pedestrian, cyclist, and scooter, is disclosed to the nearby \u00a0  vehicles. To clarify, this \u201cmulticasted\u201d in the IPv6 sense?\u00a0 The VRU\u2019s smartphone is using some kind of \u201cfake identifier\u201d (source address?) to announce its presence so as not to reveal its \u201ctrue identifier\u201d?\u00a0 Is there a security consideration (attack) that these \u201cfake identifiers\u201d multicasting to nearby vehicles could convince that vehicle that they are surrounded by pedestrians (e.g., roughly  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-04/man-creates-fake-traffic-jam-on-google-maps-by-carting-99-phones/11929136)? \u00a0  Can we state the security properties or provide a reference to handle this issue.\u00a0 I see the following text later in the section: \u00a0  To support applications of these V2X use cases, the required \u00a0  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange, transport-layer \u00a0  session continuity, and secure, safe communication between a vehicle \u00a0  and a pedestrian either directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU.

I\u2019m having trouble understanding this guidance.\u00a0 The architecture is suggesting \u201caugmented identification and verification with extra means.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t follow what \u201caugmented means\u201d or \u201cextra\u201d -- augmented or extra from what baseline?\u00a0 The security properties this provides is \u201cconfidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization and accounting\u201d don\u2019t seem to match authentication and identity topics.\u00a0  To the specific examples, how does \u201ccredit-based\u201d provide the stated security properties?\u00a0  I have the same question for the others.  ** [per -28 and same for -29] The need for safety properties (very helpful) is asserted multiple times but not further discussed in the Security Considerations: -- Section 3:\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  In addition, IPv6 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 security needs to be extended to support those V2V use cases in a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 safe, secure, privacy-preserving way. -- Section 3.1:  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To support applications of these V2V use cases, the required \u00a0 \u00a0  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange and secure,\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0  safe communication between two vehicles.\u00a0  -- Section 3.3: \u00a0  To support applications of these V2X use cases, the required \u00a0  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange, transport-layer \u00a0  session continuity, and secure, safe communication between a vehicle \u00a0  and a pedestrian either directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU. The explanation from the authors noted that the following text was added to Section 4.2 -29: \u201cA malicious party can be a group of hackers, a criminal group, and a competitor for industrial espionage or sabotage.\u201d \u201cThe verification shall provide security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, and accounting [ RFC7427 ].\u201d I\u2019m having trouble understanding how this text addresses the safety properties.",

Thank you for making edits in response to my DISCUSS positions.\u00a0 Despite these changes, it is my assessment that the security and privacy properties are not sufficiently described given the wide array of enabling technologies cited (e.g., credit-based authorization models, blockchain based authentication and logging, in vehicle credit card transactions).\u00a0 Furthermore, the document references architectural elements such as \u201clegal vehicles\u201d and \u201clegal \u2026 smartphones\u201d; and threats such as \u201cprivacy breakage\u201d without sufficient explanation.
