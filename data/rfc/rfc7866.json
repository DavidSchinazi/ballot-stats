So, the discussion is about how you will deal with that.\u00a0 Specifically, an alternative would be to have an rs-request subtype, with a content-type parameter such as \"req=metadata\" (or even use rs-metadata with \"req=snapshot\") and a rule that req= values that are not recognised be ignored.\u00a0 If this should ever need to be extended, other \"req=\" values could be defined.\u00a0 A registry could be created in future, if there turns out to be a need. There are other options, as well, but the main question is why are you sure that no such extensibility is needed? Also, what you're doing with content-disposition isn't in accord with what that field is for: it is for describing how the information in the message part should be presented -- not what it's meant to contain or be used for.\u00a0 This, too, could be better handled with a content-type parameter. The discussion on this point is whether thus was considered, and, if so, why it was rejected.",

It says \"SHOULD NOT\", but then explicitly allows for the downgrade when the SRC and SRS are in the same administrative domain. This seems to create a whole new \"last hop exception\" for media, similar to the one for SIPS that we took so many years to deprecate. (Except it's worse because the potentially insecure hop goes to an endpoint not necessarily expected to be a party to the media.) Section 6.1.2 includes a \"contract in place\" as a form of recording indication. The other mechanisms seem to say that a given call is being recorded. A contract cannot do that, except in the degenerate case of \"all calls are recorded.\" This doesn't seem to fit the spirit of the \"MUST provide recording indication\" language. Section 12, 2nd paragraph says the SRC and SRS \"MUST support SIP with TLS and MAY support SIPS with \u00a0  TLS as per [ RFC5630 ]\". That actually downgrades the requirement for SIPS support from that in 3261/5630. (3261 says you MUST support SIPS if you support TLS.)",
