I also don't see how this can ever be something to which a normal person can \"consent\" (i.e. consciously agree while fully understanding) so the term is IMO very misleading, and will I fear be used to mislead further.\u00a0 (See also some of the comments below - I do not think we ought be as fast and loose with this aleady terribly badly used term.) To summarise: I'd love if you did s/consent/anything-else/g but if not, please define consent here in a way that clearly and unambiguously distinguishes this usage from other abuses of the term. (2) WebRTC does not require STUN or TURN servers for some calls, even if it does for many. Why is it ok to require such a server be present in all calls (which I think this means) espcially when that means exposing additional meta-data (calling parties in a case where the servers weren't needed and call duration in all cases) to those servers when that is not always necessary?  (3) (end of p5) You have a MUST NOT here that is depenedent on current browser implementations. Why is that an IETF thing and not a W3C thing? But more interestingly, can one securely use this protocol without the kind of JS vs. browser sandboxing etc that's needed in the web? If the answer is \"no\" then don't you need to say that this protocol can only safely be used for such implementations? (In section 2, which almost but not quite says that.) (4) Section 8: Where are these 96 bits defined? I think this \"requires...\" statement needs a precise reference to the place in some ICE/TURN/STUN RFC where it's defined. (And I forget where that is, sorry:-) This should be an easy fix. (5) Why is it ok to approve this while the rtcweb-security-arch and rtcweb-security are still developing? There are section-specific references here along the lines of: \"doing this is ok because of section x.x\" of both of those drafts. Why is it ok to approve this now, when the underlying architecture and overall security model on which this depends are still in-flux? I'm not asking about editorial changes here nor about timing, but about why it's ok to approve this when the basic security concepts have yet to undergo IETF last call, and so could change significantly. I do not think it would be acceptable for a comment/discuss on the security documents to be received with \"yes, but you approved consent-freshness and so we implemented and deployed that so you're too late to make that comment/discuss and expect some change.\"",
