I expect this DISCUSS and COMMENT will be easy to resolve, because I basically had a question about every SHOULD (NOT) in the document, so maybe I just need help understanding.  That wasn't intentional, it just worked out that way :-) In 3.\u00a0 Network Scenarios \u00a0  After receiving RENEW (5) message from the DHCPv6 client, the NAS \u00a0  SHOULD NOT initiate a new Access-Request/Access-Accept message \u00a0  exchange with the RADIUS server; but after receiving REBIND (6) \u00a0  message from the DHCPv6 client, the NAS SHOULD initiate a new Access- \u00a0  Request/Access-Accept message exchange with the RADIUS server. could you help me understand why these are SHOULD NOT/SHOULD, and especially why the second SHOULD is not a MUST? Is there an alternative scenario that can also result in a user being allowed access? In 4.\u00a0 DHCPv6 RADIUS option \u00a0  According to the network scenarios described in section 3, the \u00a0  OPTION_RADIUS SHOULD appear in the RELAY-FORW (12) message relaying \u00a0  SOLICIT (1), REQUEST (3) and REBIND (6) from the DHCPv6 client, and \u00a0  MAY appear in the RELAY-FORW (12) relaying any other message from the \u00a0  DHCPv6 client. I'm not sure I understand why this is a SHOULD, and not a MUST. If I was trying to explain this without 2119 language, I'd say \"the OPTION_RADIUS will probably be in RELAY-FORW relaying some kinds of messages, but it might not be, and it might be in RELAY-FORW relaying any other message\". Is that a fair summary? If so, is it also correct to say that it might not be present at all? (and, if not, what's supposed to happen next?)",
