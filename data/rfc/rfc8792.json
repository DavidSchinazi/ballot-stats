I find the arguments regarding BCP versus Informational to be compelling, and am sympathetic to the concerns about both stream and charter. All of that said, I do want to see this document published, and I hope we can rearrange things in a way that allows that to happen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for taking on this work to fill a hole in the tools that we have for production of RFCs. I have one fairly major comment and several editorial suggestions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Abstract: >\u00a0 This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in >\u00a0 width-bounded text content.\u00a0 One strategy is based on the historic >\u00a0 use of a single backslash ('\\') character to indicate where line- Nit: \"historical\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \u00a71: >\u00a0 According to the RFC Editor, >\u00a0 there is currently no convention in place for how to handle long >\u00a0 lines in such inclusions, other than advising authors to clearly >\u00a0 indicate what manipulation has occurred.

For example, if I were to use this format, I would definitely want to use a string more of the format: \u00a0 \u00a0 NOTE: '\\' line wrapping per BCP XXX ([RFC XXXX]) (taking note of the added brackets). If this has already been debated in the working group and the current text is the result of carefully considering this issue and deciding that the use of the specified string has benefits that outweigh the drawback of not being able to cite the document per ordinary convention, then don't afford my suggestion any undue weight. I'm not trying to change a consensus decision. But if this is a simple oversight, I think it does need to be given significant thought. For example, I personally am rather likely to elect to do things \"the old way\" in my own documents rather than using this format because of the awkwardness of properly citing a normative reference. This same comment applies to \u00a78.1.1, of course. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- > Appendix A.\u00a0 POSIX Shell Script: rfcfold Please add [POSIX.1-2017] as a reference.",
