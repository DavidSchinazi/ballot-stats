What kind of feature negotiation is available to check support prior to using this flag?\u00a0 After all, if the peer does not implement this document it will not implement the override of 8231 error handling and will respond with errors when the D flag is set (or the PLSP-ID of 0 used).\u00a0 If we have to just \"try it and fall back to not using it if we get errors\", that has some associated security considerations as well. What can we say about authorization policy on the PCC?\u00a0 Alvaro touched on this in his Comment, but I think it's important enough to be Discuss-level.\u00a0 Since this policy is the key factor to the security posture of this extension, not only does it seem like there MUST be the ability to configure the policy, but it also seems like we should be able to give some guidance on typical use cases (where the authors believe the security properties to be reasonable).\u00a0 Other use cases might require an additional level of analysis by those proposing to deploy the solution.",
