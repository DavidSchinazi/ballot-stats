I'm promoting it to a DISCUSS because I think this needs to be resolved before publication. The current structure will make it very difficult for readers to figure out which parts of each doc they need to worry about. I think it needs to either go back to \"obsoleting\" 7601, or it needs to be recast to just talk about the changes. Note that if the former path is chosen, the IANA considerations in 7601 will need to be copied forward.",

        "text": "I also appreciate the efforts to reduce the diff between  RFC 7601  and this document; it does help readability greatly.\u00a0 (I also support Ben's  Discuss.)\u00a0 Unfortunately, it also can obscure some aspects where the text of the document did need to change as part of the update, but has not done so. For example, in Section 1: \u00a0  There exist registries for tokens used within this header field that \u00a0  refer to the specifications listed above.\u00a0 Section 6 describes the \u00a0  registries and their contents and specifies the process by which I don't think all of this is still present anymore.\u00a0 (If we were talking about registration policies, for example, we'd need an 8126 reference to replace the 5226 reference that was removed.) \u00a0  entries are added or updated.\u00a0 It also updates the existing contents \u00a0  to match the current states of these specifications. [We should double-check that everything that now allows EAI-formatted stuff is updated to also refer to this document from the IANA registry. On first glance this might include  vbr.mv  and  vbr.md , but probably much more.] Don't we need to mention the updates (or obsoletes) relationship w.r.t. 7601 in the Abstract and Introduction? Section 4.1 has: \u00a0  MUAs and downstream filters MUST ignore any result reported using a \u00a0  \"result\" not specified in the IANA \"Result Code\" registry or a \u00a0  \"ptype\" not listed in the \"Email Authentication Property Types\" \u00a0  registry for such values as defined in Section 6.\u00a0 [...] This would seem to be an internal inconsistency, in that it seems to preclude any sort of experimental usage as described in Sections 2.7.x. In Section 2.3: \u00a0  Combinations of ptypes and properties are registered and described in \u00a0  the \"Email Authentication Methods\" registry, coupled with the \u00a0  authentication methods with which they are used.\u00a0 This is further \u00a0  described in Section 6. The relevant subsection of section 6 is a pretty empty stub now.",
