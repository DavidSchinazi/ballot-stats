END ---- In Section 6, there are problems in the MIME structure in the examples (figures 16 and 17). 1. The XML content should be indented at least as much as the SIP headers, so you should either make sure that all XML lines are indented at least 6 characters, or you should make the SIP headers be indented only by 3. 2. There should not be a blank line between the Content-Type and Content-Length headers. 3. There should not be a blank line after each boundary line; the part headers should start immediately, as the first blank line ends the headers. 4. There should be a blank line between the Content-Disposition header and the XML content; that blank line ends the part headers and signals the start of the part body. 5. The intermediate boundary lines should not have the trailing \"--\"; that's reserved for the ending boundary.\u00a0 The intermediates should all be \"--boundary1\". 6.

(1) section 3: You say these MAY be used.\u00a0 I'm not sure that's a good option.\u00a0 I think the data minimisation recommendations argued for in  RFC6973  and RFC7258  would argue to add a MUST NOT. For example, saying that these additional data MUST NOT be sent in any non-emergency call without explicit user permission on a per-call basis or something similar? I have to admit I'm nervous that defining all of these may mean that some UA somewhere starts sending some of them in other calls without asking. A restriction along those lines would also be more in line with webrtc too perhaps. But maybe this was discussed in the WG, having considered those privacy issues - was it? Either way, would adding such a \"MUST NOT except if...\" be a good plan?\u00a0 4.3.4 is a good example of the kind of thing I'd not want easily emitted in a call. (2) I'd like to (perhaps briefly) argue that the registries here should require more than expert review. Extensibility in dealing with what will inevitably be highly privacy sensitive data structures that are vulnerable to misuse once registered seems to perhaps call for a more stringent registration regime. The document itself also argues (in 4.3.7) that adding new kinds of data here can be counter productive for emergency call handling, so being more conservative in what we add seems unusually correct here. I'd like to suggest we require standards track for extensions.
