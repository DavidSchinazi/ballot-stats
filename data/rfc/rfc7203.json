(2) section 7: Is the content you suggest for the new registry actually conformant to the rules you're setting up? \"xml\" might syntactically be a hostname but \"http://xml/...\" is not really a good HTTP URI is it? And what if ICANN auction off \"xml\" as a gTLD?\u00a0 And what does \"readily...\u00a0 available\" mean?
