COAP URIs are generally subject to  BCP 190  restrictions, which would require the path to either be provisioned, discovered, or under the \".well-known\" tree. The use of a reserved domain name here may change the rationale; but for the sake of not establishing a precedent for path squatting in CoAP, this document needs to clearly explain the rationale of why  BCP 190  should not apply in this case.

        "text": "Thanks for this generally well-written document!\u00a0 It does a great job at making these fairly difficult topics accessible to the reader.\u00a0 I have a few points that should be fairly easy to address, but do need to be addressed before the document should advance. My comment on Section 8.4.4 tries to walk through some scenarios involving a finite lease time on a short address; as a result of that I think it's necessary to direct the 6LN to interpret the time in units of ASN as opposed to wall-clock time. The \"parameter_addinfo\" field in Unsupported_Parameter (Section 8.4.5) feels underspecified to me.\u00a0 The inline text says that only a subset of the link-layer key set from the Configuration could be included here, but how is that formally specified? The string COJP_MAX_JOIN_ATTEMPTS appears only twice in the text, once in Section 8.3.1 and again in the table in Section 8.5.\u00a0 The former text leaves me confused as to what counts as a \"join attempt\" for this purpose, and in particular how it differs from the MAX_RETRANSMIT timer mentioned in the previous sentence. I couldn't find a clear statement that any node sending EBs needs to be prepared to act as a join proxy; Section 4.1 notes that: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During the remainder of the join process, the node \u00a0  that has sent the EB to the pledge acts as the JP. but I couldn't find where that was enforced. I think we may need to say more about how a JP knows that \"secExempt\" is in effect (see comment in Section 5), since that affects a critical piece of the security posture of the network. Finally, can we discuss whether a 32-bit MIC is the most appropriate default for the key usage?\u00a0 I lack the domain background to know how much impact there is in going to an ENC-MIC64 or ENC-MIC128 scheme.",
