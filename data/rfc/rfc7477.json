I don't think there's a clearly correct answer here, but the issue should be documented and, ideally, a choice should be made.\u00a0  To clear this DISCUSS, the document needs to say which of the two sets of comparison operators apply, and needs to explain how serial number wrap events are accounted for (or that they are not accounted for, and this is an open issue with security implications). The easiest way to fix this would be to require a comparison for equality, but I realize that this would place an additional burden on implementations which may be impractical. Point 2-- In 3.2.1, you don't say what to do if the name server returns an NS record listing names queries on which result in NXDOMAIN, or for which neither A nor AAAA records exist. Point 3-- I don't think you've specifically excluded RRtypes not mentioned in section 3.2.\u00a0 It's seems obvious to me based on what's stated in section 2 that the intention of the document is to only support these two RRtypes, but I think it is necessary to say so explicitly, if that is in fact what is intended.\u00a0  If something else is intended, text explaining what is intended should be added.\u00a0  E.g., if it's okay for cooperating child name servers to set bits not listed here, and for cooperating parent name servers to process them, you should say so.",
