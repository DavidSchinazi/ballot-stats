I do have one major concern that I believe rises to the level of a DISCUSS, although I believe it should be trivial to fix. The reason I believe it to be a barrier to publication is that it makes a broad architectural statement that has implications for all application protocols; which, beyond being outside the remit of the working group per its charter, I seriously doubt received the level of cross-area review appropriate for its scope. The statement of concern is in section 5.5.5: \u00a0  As is the case with NAT ALGs, protocol designers are advised to avoid \u00a0  communicating names and addresses in nonstandard locations, because \u00a0  those \"hidden\" names and addresses are at risk of not being \u00a0  translated when necessary, resulting in operational failures. I would expect this statement, if evaluated by the IETF community at large, to be extremely controversial: it implies application-layer protocol designs that provide neither confidentiality nor even integrity protection for protocol parameters. Architecturally, it's important to distinguish between NAT ALGs, which are not a party to the security context of the protocols they carry, and DNS discovery proxies, which are. This makes the guidance in here appropriate in the context of DNS-SD records, while being problematic in the broader NAT ALG case cited. I would find no problem with a narrowly-scoped statement that pertains to DNS usage in particular, although I wonder whether designers of DNS TXT record usage in the future are likely to become aware of such guidance.",
