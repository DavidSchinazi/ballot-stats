Thanks for addressing the SecDir review and agreeing to put some text in about the clear text passwords and the difference between a hashed version.\u00a0 I'll remove the discuss on this once the updated draft is posted. https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg05678.html 2. I see the discussion from the SecDir review changes \"MAY\" to \"may' in section 9, but I'm wondering why the word may is used as many of the attributes are PII.\u00a0 How about: \t\"defines attributes that are sensitive and the contents are considered personally identifiable information(PII)\" I have some more questions on PII and a suggestion to help resolve the concerns. 3. Is there a reason why the considerations are limited to/with an emphasis on the id and externalId?\u00a0 Most of the attributes defined in section 4 are considered PII.\u00a0 The id and externalID provide an index and that's important to protect, but so are many of the (optional) attributes.\u00a0 It would be good to make this clear in the draft.\u00a0 Since it is pointed out on id, it seems like the other attributes don't have privacy considerations when reading the draft, but a summary statement at the start of the draft would help where the index \"id\" is distinguished from the other sensitive attributes. 4. It would help to have a statement that lists the scope of where SCIM is used and that the protocol design requires encryption when this data is in transit (per the api draft), since most of the attributes defined would contain PII when used.\u00a0  I'm making some assumptions, so please correct the text to the scope of SCIM.\u00a0 The abstract has the following sentence: \u00a0  \"This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud \u00a0  service providers.\" What about the following: \u00a0  \"This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud \u00a0  service providers and their customers.\" There is also this statement int he introduction: \u00a0  \"This schema is intended for exchange and use with \u00a0  cloud service providers and other cross-domain scenarios.\" Is it also used between service providers?\u00a0 If so, permission to provide customers user information between service providers gets tricky and I don't think that was covered in the API draft, but please let me know if I missed it. If data exchanged using the SCIM schema is just between an organization and a contracted service provider, there should be SLAs for security and that could be noted in the introduction with the scope statement.\u00a0 This will alleviate some of the privacy and security concerns as you can state the concerns, but leave it up to implementers and contracts to handle the details.\u00a0 If the scope statement changes, something along the lines of the following could help: \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Security service level agreements for the handling of these \u00a0 \u00a0 attributes are outside the scope of this document, but are to \u00a0 \u00a0 be carefully considered by implementers.\"",
