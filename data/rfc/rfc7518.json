        "text": "I've got some suggestions for improvements below, but overall I cannot support this document, so I'm entering an ABSTAIN. I don't think this WG has actually fulfilled its charter with regard to this document set. The WG was supposed to produce a \"JSON syntax that can be used by applications to describe secure data objects\". I don't believe it did that. Instead, it produced a compact serialization for a particular purpose and then backed into a JSON syntax. The compact serialization drove the effort and produced IMO a substandard JSON serialization. I don't believe that (reliable) interoperable implementations of the JSON serialization will be possible using this document set. However, there is at least rough consensus that these documents are usable as-is, and I don't think there's anything to be gained by holding them up any further. I hope the WG will adopt some of the remaining comments, but my intention is not to discuss this any further. If you wish to address any of the comments and need clarification, I'm glad to help with that. ------ 3.1/4.1/5.1/6.1: The implementation requirements do not belong in this document. They should be removed. 3.2ff: None of these algorithm requirements (using MUSTs) really belong in this document. These are requirements for any new crypto algorithm that should be documented elsewhere. They are not JOSE specific. 4.8: I think the MUST for UTF-8 is seriously problematic. Because different system normalize UTF-8 strings differently, there is no way that just saying \"MUST use UTF-8\" makes for any kind of interoperability unless you go into much more detail. I think you should either (a) just say that it is an octet string or (b) refer to PRECIS. 4.8.1.1: s/UTF-8/ASCII 5.2.2.1: OLD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Here we denote the number of octets in the MAC_KEY as \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  MAC_KEY_LEN, and the number of octets in ENC_KEY as ENC_KEY_LEN; NEW \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  MAC_KEY_LEN is the number of octets in MAC_KEY and ENC_KEY_LEN is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  the number of octets in ENC_KEY. OLD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The number of octets in the input key K MUST be the sum of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  MAC_KEY_LEN and ENC_KEY_LEN. NEW \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The number of octets in the input key K MUST be the sum of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  MAC_KEY_LEN and ENC_KEY_LEN.

I'm not going to object to \"none\", even though I think it's a very dangerous feature because of the risk of confusion between Secured and Unsecured JWS. But there needs to be stronger guidance: 1. An implementation SHOULD NOT support \"none\" unless the implementor knows that it will be used in application context s that require it. 2. If an implementation does support \"none\", then it MUST NOT accept it as part of generic JWS validation.\u00a0 Instead, it should require the application to explicitly signal that an Unsecured JWS is expected for a given validation operation. Section 4.2. Systems that support RSAES-PKCS1-V1_5 key unwrap are commonly vulnerable to oracle attacks based on whether they accept the wrapped key or not.\u00a0 See, e.g., https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=25431 http://cryptosense.com/choice-of-algorithms-in-the-w3c-crypto-api/ In light of that, it seems irresponsible to include this algorithm without extensive security precautions, and especially irresponsible for it to be REQUIRED.\u00a0 It's been dropped from WebCrypto, and is being dropped from TLS in v1.3.
