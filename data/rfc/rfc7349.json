The draft specifies:\u00a0 \" If the cryptographic sequence number in the LDP packet is less than \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 or equal to the last sequence number received from the same neighbor, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the LDP message MUST be discarded, and an error event SHOULD be \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 logged.\" Can you please clarify that \"same neighbor\" means \"same source IP address\", if that is the intent?",
