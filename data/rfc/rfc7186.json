To the Security Considerations,  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6779#section-8 , which contains extra security threats. Sometimes the threat could come from the NMS. No need to repeat the information. A since pointer is enough. 2. To the MIB module specified in [ RFC 6779 ], which would help monitoring some of those security attacks with the 3 notifications and with OID polling. An single sentence, similar to the following one, would be enough: \u00a0 \u00a0 [ I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp-olsrv2-sec ] provides further information on how to enable integrity protection to NHDP, which can help mitigating the threats described related to identity spoofing.  Note that, there are some more constraints in a MANET network (the NMS might not be available to receive those SNMP notifications), so you might have to also include a reference to  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nguyen-manet-management/  that contains some more considerations.",
