Please find below two blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Yaron Sheffer for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus **but** without the justification of the intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ###  BCP 14 Please use the right  BCP14  template (including reference to  RFC 8174 ) ### No subject identifier for addresses Like Erik Kline: either suppress the \"IP or MAC address\" in section 1, or **much** better add subsection in 3.2 to handle MAC/IP addresses.",

And to echo Paul's question: Why isn't the mail system doing the canonicalization?\u00a0 Or is the goal here just to tell if two slightly different local addresses are (likely) referring to the same recipient for some aggregation purpose? My general concern here is that now the events implementation has to exactly mirror whatever canonicalization the mail system is doing, which might not be known, or would require duplication of effort, or could allow for configuration drift, etc.\u00a0 None of these are showstoppers, but it seems like more prose around this is probably a good idea if we want to go this route.",
