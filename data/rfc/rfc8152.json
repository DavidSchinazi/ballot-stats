        "text": "I think this is a fine design and well documented, (though long) and I'm sure we'll clear up the points below quickly enough. Some of them may need some discussion but others are mostly checking. (1) general: I think the inclusion of CDDL is an error here and we'd be better off having someone (if interested) generate the CDDL schema stuff later on when/if CDDL is standardised/stabilised. Including it now creates the potential for breakage unnecessarily IMO. However, the WG did explicitly discuss iirc, so this is just a personal comment that I'm also in the rough on inclusion of CDDL in this spec. (As an example, for someone not familiar with CDDL, the inclusion of fragments interspersed in the text is distracting and potentially puzzling when one gets to the end of section 3.) However, I do think there are places where the CDDL is effectively normative despite what is said in the introduction, the ones I've spotted are below. (Happy to chat about 'em as I may be mistaken.) I also wondered if one could really implement this if all the CDDL was removed from the text, which is what I think would be required if CDDL were really to be informative. Anyway the places I think some more text may be needed are: (1.1) table 2: As-is the value type column seems to me to make CDDL normative. I don't see the natural language version that you said would be normative.  (1.2) 4.4, 2nd list point 1: the use of Sig_structure makes the CDDL normative. (Same with the use in 4.5 and Enc_structure in 5.3.) (1.3) 7.1, the key_ops value is only specified in CDDL, in Table 3. (It is well-defined below the table in text though, so this one's borderline.) (1.4) 11.2: it's not clear to me that a reader knows how to handle decoding of the two optional fields at the end (other and SuppPrivInfo) without looking at the CDDL. Can you explain? (That might be just my ignorance of CBOR, but wanted to check.) (2) 3.1, alg: so you're disallowing a setup where the kid alone identifies the key and algorithm to the recipient? That is used in some IETF protocols (OSPF iirc) so rhat's a pity, and will in those (maybe less common) cases consume a few bytes that could otherwise be saved.\u00a0 I think, but am not sure, that the WG already discussed this, but if not, maybe worth a thought? (Or even a 2nd thought:-) And appendix A.1 is really puzzling - as it provides instructions for how to not follow a MUST in the body of the document. (3) 7.1: key_op 8, \"derive bits\" - I don't think this usage is clear enough, can you say what's meant here? (4) Why not make deterministic ECDSA a MUST?\u00a0 8.1.1 says: \"Applications that specify ECDSA should evaluate the ability to get good random number generation and require deterministic signatures where poor random number generation exists.\"\u00a0 I don't think that is sufficiently clear, nor realistic, and I don't recall this being discussed on the list (sorry if I'm forgetting) and bad random values are a killer flaw here that has happened in the wild. (5) Table 6, is this 25519 or 448? Where does it say?\u00a0 Sorry if I'm being dumb here, but I don't see where you say which curve is specified, the definition of 'crv' says defined for this alg which I assume means listed in Table 6. (6) section 10: why MUST the kty values be present always? That seems unnecessary in some contexts and I don't get a security reason why it's needed e.g. if there's an alg id somewhere - can you explain? I can see folks omitting this leading to interop problems for not useful reasons. (Same comment applies in other cases where kty is a MUST, e.g. 12.1.2, 12.2.1.) (7) section 11: given that we know people will use human memorable secrets, why have you not defined codepoints for PBES2 (or the more commonly supported?) PBDKF2?\u00a0 I'm fine if there's a reason, or even if it was discussed by the WG, but just wanted to check as I'd worry that folks will use the ones defined here with human memorable secrets no matter what the spec says so giving 'em something more tailored might be better. (OTOH, one could argue that making this apparent might be worse too I guess.)  (8) 12.4: Why is no ephemeral-ephemeral (E-E) variant supported? Some protocols will allow for that and it seems wrong to disallow it when it could relatively easily be supported. For some applications where content is dealt with in store-and-forward mode, there may be situations (e.g. provisioning, \"introduction\") where E-E could be used. As-is, applications wanting that will have to hack the recipient DH-public into a home-grown structure (or use one of the COSE_Key labels from Table 19) and then treat that as ES-DH. That seems likely to lead to non-interop or security errors being made. I'd be fine if you even said how to re-use the structures currently defined for E-E btw and didn't introduce new structures. (9) 16.4: I'm not sure expert review is right here.\u00a0 What if the expert is asked to add SM2/SM4 while there is still no widely available non-Chinese text to describe those?\u00a0 I think the expert ought enforce a \"specification required\" rule at least and maybe more.\u00a0 (And ought never allow an algorithm with no specification publicly available.) (10) 16.4 (and elsewhere maybe) I think this registry is missing a column - as is being done in the TLS WG, I think there should be a column saying if the IETF is happy enough with an algorithm and that getting a \"Y\" in that ought require standards action. (Or some similar scheme.) I don't think the standards-track range of codepoints is enough here, e.g. at some time we will want to deprecate things, and at other times we may want to define things for the future on the standards-track but not (yet) recommend their use.\u00a0 The last bullet in 16.11 does help here, but I'd argue that we need to do more to protect the expert (and implementers) from the trickle of vanity/national algorithms/curves that are always being proposed.",

        "text": "Thanks for the updates in -20. I think we've only the following points left. Note that all of those are questions to the WG chairs and not to Jim. \u00a0  (2) 3.1, alg: so you're disallowing a setup where the kid \u00a0  alone identifies the key and algorithm to the recipient? \u00a0  That is used in some IETF protocols (OSPF iirc) so rhat's a \u00a0  pity, and will in those (maybe less common) cases consume a \u00a0  few bytes that could otherwise be saved.\u00a0 I think, but am not \u00a0  sure, that the WG already discussed this, but if not, maybe \u00a0  worth a thought? (Or even a 2nd thought:-) And appendix A.1 \u00a0  is really puzzling - as it provides instructions for how to \u00a0  not follow a MUST in the body of the document. I think we left the mail thread on this with you saying \"Best to ask the chairs if they agree that this is WG consensus,\" as you're an admitteddly strong partisan on this topic.  So, COSE chairs - what's your take? (If you say this is ok with the WG, I'll clear.) \u00a0  (6) section 10: why MUST the kty values be present always? \u00a0  That seems unnecessary in some contexts and I don't get a \u00a0  security reason why it's needed e.g. if there's an alg id \u00a0  somewhere - can you explain? I can see folks omitting this \u00a0  leading to interop problems for not useful reasons. (Same \u00a0  comment applies in other cases where kty is a MUST, e.g. \u00a0  12.1.2, 12.2.1.) I think this is the similar to discuss point (2) above. So again, COSE chairs, can you confirm that this design does reflect WG consensus and isn't just a thorough and good editor getting his way? (If you say this is ok with the WG, I'll clear.)",
