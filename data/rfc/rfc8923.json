I see that  draft-ietf-taps-interface-01  has a normative reference to it, so this is effectively setting up a downref situation. That isn't necessarily a problem, but if the point is for this document to recommend an actual minimal set of transport services to be supported and exposed via the API specified in  draft-ietf-taps-interface  and other APIs, shouldn't that set be normative?",

Section 3.3.2 and Appendix A.3.1 are limiting this \"minimal set\" of transport services to exclude discrete messages and allow only the provisioning for TCP-like byte streams.\u00a0 While I can understand the desire to make TCP the \"gold standard\", the surrounding discussion, particularly in A.3.1, seems to be a layering violation.\u00a0 That is, we are hearing that AFra-Bytestream requires receivers (i.e., applications) to be able to consume contiguous bytestreams.\u00a0 But this seems to really be a requirement on the application protocol to be self-framing (and to provide its own sequence numbers if needed)!\u00a0 Normally we think of an application protocol placing requirements on the transport, or a particular transport as being inappropriate for use with a given application protocol.\u00a0 So I think this document needs to more explicitly acknowledge that this is not a \"generic minimal set\" of transport features, but rather a minimal set that is applicable for many, but not all, applications: some application protocols have requirements that are not met by this \"minimal set\". In Section A.3.6, \"Data encryption\" and \"source authenticity\" are absent from the list of \"security related transport features\" (that are relegated to the other document); this seems like a fatal omission.",
