There is too much that is too close to marketing text and that would not really help an implementer or someone investigating these RFCs, or someone further developing those RFCs.  It seems to me that only sections 7.1 and 7.4 contain the kind of information that I'd expect to find in an RFC like this. As far as I can see only those two sections actually refer to sections of, or content from, the RFCs concerned in a way that is useful to document in an RFC. I also could not access the URL in section 1. That seems like it really would need fixing. (I will admit that I may be somewhat biased here - IMO any document with 26+ occurrences of the string \"cyber\" is likely not a good candidate for an RFC;-)",
