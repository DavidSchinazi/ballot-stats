I\u00a0 also appreciate the addition of the \"Policy Conflicts\" section that portrays a fairly clear picture of the interaction between this mechanism, DANE, and MTA-STS.\u00a0 I still wish that we were able to bring the technologies into greater alignment and not need to convey the sense that standards-track mechanisms are in conflict with each other, but cannot justify blocking publication based solely on that desire. In this space, though, I do request an additional wording tweak in Appendix A.2, which currently states \"The TLS-Required header field is used when the sender of the message wants to override the default policy of the recipient domain to require TLS.\" which uses the \"override\" terminology without couching it as a request.\u00a0 Can we reword to include \"request\" here as well? The following paragraph (unchanged from my ballot on -07) received only minimal discussion so far: I'm also concerned about the apparent new burden placed on senders in Section 4.3 to actively decide whether every outgoing message requires end-to-end TLS protection or is safe to forward without TLS (\"when TLS is to be required, [...].\u00a0 When TLS is not to be required, [...]\"), where both \"[...]\" require new behavior not present in a client that does not implement this specification.\u00a0 To some extent this is an editorial matter of how the new mechanisms are portrayed, but I don't see much in this document to justify the stance that the default \"don't care\" option should be removed (for clients that implement this specification at all). It seems that we are in agreement that it's okay to have a \"don't care\" option, which is indicated by not using the extension at all.\u00a0 That said, I still think that the specific text of Section 4.3 conveys an impression that there is a requirement to actively decide, with the language about \"has the authority to decide whether to require TLS\", \"when TLS is\u00a0 to be required\", \"when TLS is not to be required\", and \"in either case, the decision [...] MAY be done based on [...]\".\u00a0  Perhaps I'm just misreading the text, but I haven't seen any signals to that effect yet.\u00a0 I'd suggest (but am open to further refinement\" changing to \"has the option to decide whether to require TLS\" and \"if one of these cases is selected, the decision [...]\" as a way to clarify the language used. [discussion of \"de facto part of the core SMTP spec\" removed, on\u00a0 indications that this is not the intent] We had some good discussion about the three potential cases for authenticating the TLS connection: (1) Dane per  RFC 7672 (2) MTA-STS per  RFC 8461 (3) DNSSEC-validated MX records + WebPKI authentication of the MX hosts I think a little more specificity is needed for the (3) case; we do say to use the  RFC 6125  procedures but still need to specify (e.g.) that the DNS-ID name type is used and (IIRC) that the hostname resulting from the MX lookup is used as the DNS-ID to be validated.",
