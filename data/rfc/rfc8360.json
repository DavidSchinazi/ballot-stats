The last paragraph of section 5 implies that you can, but doesn't say so explicitly. If you _can_ mix policies, what happens if you do? If I read the rules in 4.2.4.4. correctly (and it's likely that I am not), if you run into a cert in the chain that does not follow this profile, it's likely to give a null VRS-IP or VRS-AS value, which would seem to invalidate an certificate further down the chain that _does_ follow this policy? So, I guess it comes down to the following: If mixed policies are allowed, how does that work? If mixed policies are not allowed, there needs to be text that says that. It's quite possible such text exists (here or elsewhere), and I missed it.",

One thing isn't quite clear to me, so I'm balloting this as a DISCUSS with the plan that a small amount discussion will resolve it. With the definition of the new validation OID (a idea that I like BTW), at any stage of the certificate issuance can the validation OID be switched? That is a TA has a particular OID and down the tree an issued certificate has a different OID? If that can't happen (and please make that clear in the document) is there plan to migrate the set of all issued certificates to the new OID? and deprecate the old OID? Logically speaking a trust anchor cannot be thought of as over-claiming. (eg you trust where the self signed cert came from, and its contents) However the new validation\u00a0 constructs suggest that a TA can over-claim, but it seems like there won't be any warning (as the example in S4.3)\u00a0 to highlight this possible eventuality when (in the model where all RIRs issue a TA) a resource is transferred from one RIR to another for the clients use. Is that interpretation correct? OR does this new model espouse the belief that all RIRs each issue a TA that covers 0/0 and ::/0 in perpetuity? In that construct does this mean that  RFC6491  should be updated or made historic?",
