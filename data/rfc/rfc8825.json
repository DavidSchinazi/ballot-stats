        "text": "DISCUSS-DISCUSS: No action for the authors at this point in time. Reading from the document objectives, from the abstract: \u00a0  This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite \u00a0  intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in \u00a0  browsers - \"real time communication on the Web\". \u00a0  It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure \u00a0  all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and \u00a0  that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully \u00a0  specified and on the right publication track. Reading this, I was thinking: great, I will have the full overview. With \"deployed\", \"starting and coordination point to make sure that all the parts ...\" I will have some\u00a0 focus on the operational aspects, basically, how should operators operate theses browser-embedded applications. Now, reading further ... \u00a0  This document is intended to serve as the roadmap to the WebRTC \u00a0  specifications.\u00a0 It defines terms used by other parts of the WebRTC \u00a0  protocol specifications, lists references to other specifications \u00a0  that don't need further elaboration in the WebRTC context, and gives \u00a0  pointers to other documents that form part of the WebRTC suite. ... I thought: Ok, if not covered here, at least I will have a pointer to another operational document. But wait: \u00a0  By reading this document and the documents it refers to, it should be \u00a0  possible to have all information needed to implement an WebRTC \u00a0  compatible implementation. So is this only about implementation? I like this document very much as it explains all the RTCWEB pieces in one location. However, there is one important piece missing: the network management considerations. See  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5706#appendix-A This is where I'm coming from, discussing some more with Warren (this a cut and past from this ballot): \u00a0 \u00a0 [ Edit: So, after more thought (and some discussion) I think that it would be useful for the document to at least note the fact that technologies like this mean that some of the existing operational practices may need to change. For example, many enterprises perform QoS based upon the fact that certain types of devices live in certain subnets (e.g many phones get placed in a specific VLAN using LLDP or CDP). With more real time content coming from browsers, these matching practices break, and so operators may not be able to QoS mark / prioritize traffic accordingly. Perhaps something like: \"One of the implications of a solution like WebRTC is that more real-time traffic will be sourced from computers (and not dedicated devices like telephones or videoconferencing devices). This may have implications for operators performing QoS marking and prioritization\" ? This isn't really specific to webrtc, but rather to a more general set of solutions like softphones and the like, but is accelerated by WebRTC. ] In light of the previous discussions about  draft-mm-wg-effect-encrypt-11 , the operators are used to manage voice, video, gaming a certain way, with their operational current practices. Now, their current practices might not work any longer. What should they do now in term of monitoring, troubleshooting, QoS, SLA monitoring, etc these days with WebRTC? While we should add this note (or a similar one) in the doc, I'm wondering: where are (should be) those operational aspects discussed, if not here? I've seen  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rtcweb-qos-18 , not sure it's appropriate. Anyway, it's now in a RFC-editor state. I could have requested a specific manageability doc in the charter. Too late now.",
