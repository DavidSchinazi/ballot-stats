        "text": "I'd like to discuss the following comments from the Gen-ART reviewer: \"Throughout, but particularly in section 5, this document refers to \"hosts\" doing address selection. To be fair, so does  RFC 6724 , but 6724 is referring to *default* address selection. In reality, *applications* do address selection on a host; the host stack will only do address selection if the application requests a default address. That works well for the scenarios in 6724, but in this document, for example section 5.2.3, I'm not so sure. The idea that a host would receive an ICMP destination unreachable and re-arrange its address selection seems at least an incomplete picture: An application with a (normal, non-multi-path) TCP connection to a remote application is not able to \"try another source address to reach the destination\"; the source address is already set for that TCP connection, so the only choice is to close the connection entirely. If the application chooses to re-establish the connection with a default address, yes, the host stack could then give a new default address back to the application, but this is hardly the dynamic and quickly adjusting process that the document seems to be envisioning. I don't think the above invalidates the core of the document or requires some grand rewrite. But I do think some clarification is in order, saying that the mechanisms described help with the *default* address selection, and some short discussion of the limitations for what applications can (and more importantly cannot) do with these mechanisms would be useful.\"",

However, all solutions discussed in sec 5.3. assume that the endpoint will switch its IP address. In case of TCP, which is not migration-capable, as indicated by the TSV-ART reviewer (Thanks Michael!), this would mean that I have to open a new TCP connection and start over again. That doesn't see optimal. Should this be considered?",
