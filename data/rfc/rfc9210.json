        "text": "(1) This should be pretty easy to resolve, but this text from \u00a74.4 does not seem to match up with the referenced document: \u00a0  The use of TLS places even stronger operational burdens on DNS \u00a0  clients and servers.\u00a0 Cryptographic functions for authentication and \u00a0  encryption requires additional processing.\u00a0 Unoptimized connection \u00a0  setup takes two additional round-trips compared to TCP, but can be \u00a0  reduced with TCP Fast Open, TLS session resumption [ RFC8446 ] and TLS \u00a0  False Start [ RFC7918 ]. Two additional round trips was true of TLS 1.2 and prior versions, but as of TLS 1.3 the application data from the client can be sent after only 1 round trip, accompanying the client Finished (and authentication messages, if in use).\u00a0 Given the nature of the rest of the sentence, we might want to specifically mention TLS 1.3 as an improvement over TLS 1.2, but there are probably a number of ways that we could fix it.\u00a0 Note additionally that for TLS 1.3, session resumption is not a reduction in the number of round trips unless 0-RTT data is used (but AFAIK there is not a published application profile specifying acceptable DNS content for TLS 0-RTT data, so use of TLS 0-RTT data for DNS is forbidden), but is still an efficiency gain due to the reduced number of cryptographic operations (including certificate validation). (2) Trivial to address, but the section heading for Appendix A.8 references  RFC 3326  (The Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)), not  RFC 3226  (DNSSEC and IPv6 A6 aware server/resolver message size requirements)",
