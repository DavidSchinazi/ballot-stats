Do we need to worry about fragmentation overlap attacks when packets are reassembled?\u00a0 I see that you would not have to worry about it in cases where fragmentation is handled at a different layer as is the case with some of the methods as it might be addressed at that layer.\u00a0 Or does it not matter as the reassembled packets would be forwarded and the device reassembling wouldn't be processing the payload where an exploit could avoid detection?",
