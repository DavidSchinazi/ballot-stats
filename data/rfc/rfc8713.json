Either I don\u2019t understand what this is saying or I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible.\u00a0 Paraphrasing, the first paragraph says that it\u2019s OK for the announcement of the sitting IAB member\u2019s resignation to happen at the same time as the announcement of that member\u2019s confirmed replacement.\u00a0 That means that at the time of the resignation, the NomCom already had to have selected the replacement, given that selection to the confirming body, and had it confirmed.\u00a0 Which means that step 4 had to have happened before step 2, or at least before step 3, no? \u2014 Section 4.6 \u2014 \u00a0  Any such appointment must be temporary and does not absolve the Chair \u00a0  of any or all responsibility for ensuring the NomCom completes its \u00a0  assigned duties in a timely fashion. Then where does it say how to permanently replace a NomCom Chair who really does have to leave permanently (say, death or incapacity, unexpected family issues, or even just is no longer willing to do it)? \u2014 Section 4.10 \u2014 \u00a0  The prior year's Chair may select a designee from a pool composed of \u00a0  the voting volunteers of the prior year's committee and all prior \u00a0  Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.\u00a0 If the prior year's Chair is \u00a0  unavailable or is unable or unwilling to make such a designation in a \u00a0  timely fashion, the Chair of the current year's committee may select \u00a0  a designee in consultation with the Internet Society President. Why is it that the prior year\u2019s Chair can pick someone else on her own, but the current Chair has to consult with the ISOC President to do the same thing?",

As I went recently through the process, I read the document with the eyes of someone going through the NomCom interview process as well as transition to an AD role. So, this is a review with bias. == COMMENTS == -- Section 3.5 -- Having been through the transition myself, I wonder why the IESG paragraph is so complex when compared to the IAB one: let's have the IESG terms also overlap during the First meeting. No hard feeling though, just easier / clearer for incoming AD. -- Section 3.6 -- Just wondering in which case(s) this would be desirable: \"The NomCom may choose not to include some names in the disclosed list, at their discretion.\" -- Section 5.6 -- What happens if it is impossible to get the 7 voting members for a candidate selection vote? Of course, the vote can be postponed but not further away than the milestones. Should there be a link with section 5.7 (voting member recall) ? or another 'last resort' process? == NITS == -- Section 1. -- Please expand IASA (or add a reference) before its first use.",

I'm apologize that some of these might be pedantic, but I think that this is an important document to get right and make as clear as possible.  D1: 4.17.\u00a0 Announcement of Selection Results \"If a selected volunteer, upon reading the announcement with the list \u00a0  of selected volunteers, finds that two or more other volunteers have \u00a0  the same affiliation, then the volunteer should notify the Chair who \u00a0  will determine the appropriate action.\" Why is this limited (\"If a selected volunteer...\")? What if someone else notices it? (as an example, the chair notices that they messed up during the previous step?) D2: 6.\u00a0 Dispute Resolution Process \" 4.\u00a0 After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue, the arbiter decides on a resolution.\" Can this be changed to \"After consultation with the principal parties...\"? Disputes get messy and I don't see what specifying \"two\" adds here.  D3: :7.6.\u00a0 3/4 Majority \u00a0  \"A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is required\u00a0 for a recall.\" \"3/4 majority of the members who vote\", or \"eligible voting members\"? If only one person actually casts their vote does that equal 100%?  I'm perfectly fine if that is the intent, just wanted to make sure I'm reading it correctly. I personally feel that everyone should be expected to vote on this - I dislike the idea that people can abstain from voting because they don't want to get their hands dirty, and instead wait for one of their colleagues to stand up and make the hard decision. I also realize that this is already covered in the general confidentiality discussions, but I suspect that there is / will be more drama and intrigue around recalls - might it be worth reiterating that voting is confidential and / or should they be secret ballots? I really don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable voting to recall someone because they fear repercussions....",
