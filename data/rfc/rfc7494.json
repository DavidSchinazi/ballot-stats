Here is a link to the full review: https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg05260.html Here are the specific suggestions: The Security Considerations Section says that this document does not introduce any new security risks compared to  RFC5416 , and that the security considerations described in  RFC5416  apply here as well.\u00a0 I believe that a document that addresses the placement of encryption functionality should say something more, in particular *why* it introduces no new security risks.\u00a0 In the case of negotiation, the main security risk is that an attacker could interfere with the negotiation so that a less secure alternative is chosen even when a more secure one is available.\u00a0 In the security considerations section of  RFC5416  it is noted that there is a possibility of a replay attack if encryption resides at the WTP.\u00a0 The risk is slight, and the only way of closing the security gap is expensive, so the authors of  RFC5416  decide to let the risk stand.\u00a0 However, this presents a conceivable attack in which an attacker could cause an AC to believe that a WTP only supports\u00a0  encryption functionality at the WTP, and the AC would choose the less secure mode.\u00a0 Although the risk this introduces is also slight, I believe that this should be mentioned. Also, would I be correct in assuming that a WTP that supports encryption at the WTP but not at the AC is unlikely? If that is so, it might be possible to close the security gap by having the ATP reject advertisements (request a retransmit?) that only support encryption at the WTP, and if so you should mention that too.  Thank you.",
