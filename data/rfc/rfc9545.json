My understanding is that by default SR-MPLS implements PHP - so the router that receives a packet with a PSID will normally find the PSID at top of stack (it may be the only label but it will be top stack).\u00a0 This however changes in the case of explicit NULL - which may or may not be BoS.\u00a0 Normally explicit NULL would be popped on egress - however, in this case the explicit NULL would have to be \"ignored (stepped over)\" such that the PSID could be processed - and then on egress the explicit NULL and the PSID would have to be popped.\u00a0 Alternatively, the explicit NULL would need to be popped, the PSID processed, and then the PSID popped.\u00a0 I'm not quite sure what the implications of this would be, though, at minimum, this could potentially result in significant performance degradation.\u00a0  Either way, lets discuss because I think this scenario does need addressing.",
