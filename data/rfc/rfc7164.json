When this is discussion has taken place I will certainly move to yes. \"IEEE 1588,[9] GPS [10] and other TAI [11] references do not include leap seconds.\u00a0 \" There is a subtly in 1588 that it might be useful to call out.  Whilst the 1588 clock is TAI based, 1588 does carry leap seconds, which can be used to derive UTC. So there is a risk that an inexperienced user might assume that their 1588 derived clock is LS free, whereas LS are being provided to the application. On the other hand 1588 automatically provides the LS channel you are looking for. The text then goes on to say: \"All participants working to a leap-second-bearing reference SHOULD recognize leap seconds\" In one sense 1588 is LS bearing, and in another sense it is not. This has a bearing on the resolution of Brian's discuss. I think that it's not so much the reference as the timescale that needs to be called out and the SHOULD ought to be a MUST.",
