Hopefully this will be easy to address: \u00a73 says \"Report submitters MAY ignore certificate validation errors when submitting reports via https.\" Yet the security considerations mention how an attacker than can subvert SMTP security might also be able to subvert the TLSRTP TXT records. It seems like one potential result of that could be to redirect the reports to a hostile destination, or at least away from the intended destination. Ignoring certificate validation errors\u00a0 removes a check against that sort of thing. I'm sure there are good reasons to allow that; I can even guess at a few. But I think allowing that sort of behavior needs explicit motivation, and I failed to find text that did that.",

So, if I query for '_smtp._tls.example.com' and get back: \"v=TLSRPTv1;rua=mailto: foo@example.com \" \"v=TLSRPTv3;rua=mailto: bar@example.com \" I throw away the one that contains 'bar', fair enough, got it. What I don't understand is what a record would look like which is a single record (#2), but that contains multiple strings (#3). Can you provide an example of a TXT record with multiple strings? I don't *think* that this is just me being dense, and so I think that the document needs to better explain this / include the example.",
