        "text": "Hi, Thanks for this document, I think that it is a helpful update.\u00a0 Disclaimer, I'm not a security expert, but I would like to discuss some of the  RFC 2119  constraints that have been specified please: (1)  I find some of the 2119 language to be somewhat contradictory: \u00a0 *\u00a0 Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 [ RFC4346 ]. \u00a0 *\u00a0 Implementations MUST support TLS 1.2 [ RFC5246 ] and MUST prefer to \u00a0 \u00a0  negotiate TLS version 1.2 over earlier versions of TLS. The second sentence implies that a TLS 1.2 is allowed to negotiate earlier versions of TLS, but a previous statement indicates that this is not allowed.\u00a0 A similar contradiction appears for DTLS: \u00a0  *\u00a0 Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 [ RFC4347 ]. \u00a0  *\u00a0 Implementations MUST support DTLS 1.2 [ RFC6347 ] and MUST prefer to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 negotiate DTLS version 1.2 over earlier versions of DTLS. (2)   \t\u00a0  *\u00a0 New protocol designs that embed TLS mechanisms SHOULD use only TLS\t  \t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.3 and SHOULD NOT use TLS 1.2; for instance, QUIC [ RFC9001 ]) took\t  \t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 this approach.\u00a0 As a result, implementations of such newly-\t  \t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 developed protocols SHOULD support TLS 1.3 only with no\t  \t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 negotiation of earlier versions. Why is this only a SHOULD and not a MUST?\u00a0 If a new protocol (rather than an updated version of an existing protocol) was being designed why would it be reasonable to design it to support TLS 1.2?\u00a0 If you want to keep these as SHOULD rather than MUSTs then please can the document specify under what circumstances it would be reasonable for a new protocol design to use TLS 1.2. (3)  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  When TLS-only \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 communication is available for a certain protocol, it MUST be used \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by implementations and MUST be configured by administrators.\u00a0 When \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 a protocol only supports dynamic upgrade, implementations MUST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 provide a strict local policy (a policy that forbids use of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 plaintext in the absence of a negotiated TLS channel) and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 administrators MUST use this policy. The MUSTs feel too strong here, since there are surely deployments and streams of data where encryption, whilst beneficial, isn't an absolute requirement? In addition \"MUST be used by implementations and MUST be configured by administrators\" also seem to conflict, i.e., if the implementation must use it then why would an administrator have to enable it? (4)\u00a0   \u00a0  When using RSA, servers MUST authenticate using certificates with at \u00a0  least a 2048-bit modulus for the public key.\u00a0 In addition, the use of \u00a0  the SHA-256 hash algorithm is RECOMMENDED and SHA-1 or MD5 MUST NOT \u00a0  be used ([ RFC9155 ], and see [CAB-Baseline] for more details). So, for clarity, this would presumably mean that SHA-256 is also preferred over say SHA-512?\u00a0 Is that the intention?\u00a0 Or would it be better if the SHOULD allowed stronger ciphers?",
