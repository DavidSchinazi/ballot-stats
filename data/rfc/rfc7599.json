Several of the IESG comments on this document are for the -06 version of this document, which was put forward for Experimental status. This one is put forward for Proposed Standard, but comments haven't been updated. I would like the IESG to be clear what it is balloting on. Along similar lines, the ballot seems to be taken from the shepherd writeup, which is clearly a writeup for this document as Experimental. Probably the ballot should have been cleared and re-issued. But so long as we confirm on the call that nobody's position will have changed due to the status change, that's cool. 2. One the day of the latest Last Call, after the Last Call announcement was generated, there was an IPR Disclosure on this document by a participant in the WG. The Last Call announcement went out indicating that there were no IPR disclosures on the document. The WG participant who made the disclosure is also the listed inventor for both of the patents cited in the disclosure, and the disclosure is for a royalty-bearing license. This appears to me to be a horribly late disclosure. Did the WG discuss this disclosure? 3. I would like to hear some discussion of the abstentions now in light of the fact that the document is going for Proposed Standard. I understand that Brian's position is that the status of the document makes no difference to his assessment, but I'd like to hear from others on this point before I ballot No Objection.",
