I'd like to see some discussion of this; if afterwards people still think it's a good idea, I will clear. If I understand correctly, the interpretation of a component name is entirely contextual to the trust framework. While trust frameworks are encouraged to reuse existing components for similar purposes, there's no real way to enforce that. And given that even if trust frameworks share a component, they may assign entirely different value types, I don't see the value of registering components. Furthermore, since the instructions to the experts asks them to look at things like general applicability vs limited application, I can see registration requests creating a fair amount of discussion (meaning work for people). So, why register components at all? Why not leave them up to trust frameworks to define as they please? Is harm done if different frameworks use the same component name for completely different things? (I could see registering the frameworks themselves, but I leave that to the WG to decide.)",
