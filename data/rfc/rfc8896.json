This document replaces  draft-randriamasy-alto-cost-calendar , but this information is not reflected in the datatracker.\u00a0 The individual draft has an IPR declaration attached to it [1], but the failure to link the two documents has resulted in the IPR indication not carrying over.\u00a0  The direct effect is that the IETF Last Call [2] explicitly says that \"No IPR declarations have been submitted directly on this I-D.\" The Shepherd writeup says that \"The entire author team has confirmed conformance with  BCP 78 /79 with the shephered.\" -- but that doesn't indicate whether IPR is present or not, just conformance.\u00a0 In looking through the mailing list archive, I couldn't find mention of the IPR at adoption [3] [4] or at WGLC [5]. The declaration was made early in the process [6], and there was no discussion in the WG about it.\u00a0 I can see how it would be easy to overlook.

I see value, but have a couple of points I think need to be resolved prior to publication: \u00a73.1, definition of \"time-interval-size\": What is the reasoning behind using a string to define the unit? That requires text parsing/comparison to determine the interval. I assume this is intended more for machine use than for human use. Did the working group consider making this a multiple of some primitive time interval? E.g. number of seconds, or perhaps number of minutes? it seems like that would be easier (and therefore less error prone) to interpret. If there is a reason to use a text field, is there an enumeration of legal unit values? Can I use \"12 parsecs\"? \u00a74.1.2, last paragraph: \"The ALTO Client thus may use the same calendar for the next 4 days starting at \"calendar-start-time\" and will only need to request a new one for Friday July 4th at 00:00:00 GMT.\" This implies that if an ALTO server delivers a calendar with a long duration, it cannot make changes to the metrics in that calendar, or if it does make them it cannot expect the client to learn about those changes. Is that the intent? If so, it seems to contradict language in the security considerations (\u00a76) that future events may change and that the client should ensure information updates. (The operational considerations [\u00a77] also say the client does not need to query again during the calendar duration.)",
