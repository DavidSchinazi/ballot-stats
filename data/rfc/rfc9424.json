It is interesting and an easy read and so refreshing to read the British \"defense\" ;-) Once my DISCUSS is cleared, I intend to ballot a YES. Please find below one blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Jen Linkova for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus (always low response rate in OPSEC) *and* the justification of the intended status.  Other thanks to Dave Thaler, the Internet directorate reviewer (at my request), please consider this int-dir review: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-opsec-indicators-of-compromise-03-intdir-telechat-thaler-2023-01-13/ Dave has raised interesting issues in the text, notably linked to IP addresses, that I fully second; _I have yet to read any reply from the authors_, but the review was posted just before the week-end and we are on the blue Monday. I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Section 3.1 no IPv6 data I am *really* surprised to only see IPv4 addresses in the numbers, even if today AlienVault has 7k IPv6 addresses as IoC vs. 3M IPv4 addresses. Please include some IPv6 statistics. I appreciate that this issue does not really comply to a DISCUSS point but it is so easy to address and I would like to start a discussion with the authors and the AD.",
