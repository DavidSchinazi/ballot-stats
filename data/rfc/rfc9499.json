It defines- \u00a0 \u00a0 Full resolver: This term is used in [ RFC1035 ], but it is not defined there.  RFC 1123  defines a \"full-service resolver\" that may or may not be what was intended by \"full resolver\" in [ RFC1035 ]. This term is not properly defined in any RFC. While section 6 starts with - \"This section defines the terms used for the systems that act as DNS clients, DNS servers, or both. \". It does not really define \"Full resolver\". I am not sure what I am supposed to do with the definition (more like description) provided here. This should be clarified. what was the consideration here?",
