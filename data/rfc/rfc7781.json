(Maybe this helps: I\u2019m not actually sure why in a k-element set you order them based\u00a0 mod k because that would seem to produce likely duplicates. Since your backup option in the case of duplicates is proper numeric sort, why just not do that and only that? E.g. \"RBridges are sorted in byte string ascending order by their LAALP IDs, or if they are equal, by their System IDs considered as unsigned integers.\u201d But it could also be that it is too early and I have not yet had enough Diet Coke\u2026) Also, I am not sure I understand this in Section 5.2: \u00a0  Assuming there are \u2026 k member RBridges in an RBv; ... each RBridge is \u00a0  referred to as RBj where 0 <= j < k-1 Wouldn\u2019t that mean that for 2 bridges you have RB0 only, because j=1 does not satisfy 0 <= j < k-1 because 0 <= 1 < 1 is untrue.
