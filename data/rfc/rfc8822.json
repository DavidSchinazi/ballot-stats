I realize there have been expressions of support on the last-call list since the IESG started balloting, but they didn't speak to the IPR question.  (2) If I understand the vision for the IANA registry here, I think it needs to have a specification required policy rather than expert review. It seems like a large part of the value would be having documented specs for other versions (just as for this version), and given that the version space is small I assume we're not expecting a flood of registration requests without documentation.",

The Shepherd writeup says that the \"document is an Individual Submission that was developed in the Broadband Forum.\"\u00a0 And also adds this opinion: \u00a0  This draft represents a strong-consensus technical solution that has \u00a0  undergone many iterations (and looking at various other alternatives) \u00a0  in Broadband Forum. All the major router vendors and ISPs wanting to \u00a0  do 5G wireline have been involved and are on board... It points to consensus -- but in the BBF.

        "text": "Similar to Alvaro, I am concerned if the intention is for this document to be published in the IETF stream. I agree with Alvaro's concern on consensus and meeting  RFC8789  guidelines. Even more of a concern for me is that it does not follow the guidelines of  RFC4775  ( BCP125 ) if the intention is in support of BBF's work. RFC4775  recommends when there is a formal liaison in place with another SDO, the liaison channel should be used. On this work, there has been no formal liaison communicating this document meets their needs? The document acknowledges \"This memo is a result of comprehensive discussions by the Broadband Forum's Wireline Wireless Convergence Work Area.\" The Shepherd writeup cites informal verification of support for the document. List discussion indicates the same. But there has been no formal communication confirming these statements. While this document's supporters may be correct in their affirmation of BBF's consensus on this document, RFC4774  was done to ensure IETF and another SDO do communicate directly.  RFC4774  has been valuable in setting the guidelines for other SDOs over these last years. It would be a bad precedent to ignore it here. Considering IETF has a formal liaison relationship with BBF, I don't think it will introduce too much of a delay to obtain confirmation on this solution meeting their needs. I would recommend also sending a note to our IETF-IEEE coordination group.",
