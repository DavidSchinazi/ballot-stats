According to the text, both extensions are intended to collect information \"along the path\", and the Figures clearly depict what is intended to happen.\u00a0 However, I don't think that as specified (or at least as explained) the behavior is guaranteed.\u00a0 Specific points: 1.  RFC6940  says (in Section 6.2. (Symmetric Recursive Routing)) that an \"overlay MAY be configured to use alternative routing algorithms\u2026[or]\u2026MAY be selected on a per-message basis\". How is the symmetry enforced if other routing algorithms are used?\u00a0 Enforcing that the ping/trace messages use symmetric routing when other algorithms are in use won't necessarily help because the paths may be different. 2.  RFC6940  also (in 6.2.2. (Response Origination)) reads: \"the response traverses the same peers as the request traversed, except in reverse order (symmetric routing) and possibly with extra nodes (loose routing).\" In other words, even if symmetric routing is used, there is no guarantee that the same path will be followed by the response, unless the originator builds the Via List with strict details of all the nodes in the path -- maybe this is what is intended, but no explicit mention occurs in the document. 3. In 4.3, what does \"directly or via symmetric routing\" mean? Is it directly connected? If so, then (for the text in 4.3) that would mean that C is adjacent to A, and even though it is the next hop after B, the path taken to reach C with the PathTrack request doesn't include B \u2014 the result is that the diagnostic information received from C may not be relevant relative to destination D.   Are there implementations available?\u00a0 What has been the experience? The Shepherd's write-up didn't mention any, and the TBD codes make me think that maybe Experimental might be a better status for this document.",

This is not shown in the table at all. What's perhaps causing the confusion is that there are special values (all 0s and all 1s) that convey nothing is requested and that everything is requested. This does not appear to be the same as having two reserved bits. You may want one or the other or both, but as it stands 9.1 or 5.3 do not seem to be saying the same thing. Also, Section 5.3 uses \"delimited\" when it probably should have said \"terminated\", unless there's more substructure in the SOFTWARE_VERSION string than is identified by the text.",

Are these meant to be normative language and \u201cSHOULD\u201d?   - There are different terms used in the first few sections, which are not introduced properly. One substantial term the reader is surprised with is \"diagnostic kind type\". - I believe the basic terms used in the document should be defined in a Terminology section if not defined in  RFC 6940 . The Terminology section should mention that the terminology from  RFC 6940  is used. - The term \"Kind\" has been defined in  RFC 6940 . If the term \"kind\" is to be used as defined in  RFC 6940  it should be used with a capital \"K\". - There are different very long sentences and a few 5-to-6-part-substantives which don't contribute to readability (e.g.: \u201csingle, general P2PSIP overlay diagnostic framework\u201d). - Concerning: \"The second is a new method and response, PathTrack,\" I would like to suggest to delete \"and response\" or call it \"a new request/response method\".
