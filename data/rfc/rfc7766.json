The Intended RFC Status of this document is \u201cInternet Standard\u201d, which seems like a logical progression from  RFC5966  (Proposed Standard).\u00a0 However, I am concerned that the proper process was not followed: 1.  RFC6410  calls for \u201can IETF-wide Last Call of at least four weeks\u201d, but the LS started on Nov/23 and ended on Dec/7, 2 weeks. 2. In looking at the archives I couldn\u2019t find any discussion about changing the maturity level. 3. It also concerns me that the changes go beyond a simple revision of the old text.\u00a0 For example, there are recommendations that are completely new and for topics that were not even mentioned in the original (e.g. pipelining). I may have missed the discussions in the archive.\u00a0 Not being a DNS expert I may also be overestimating the changes to this document. But knowing that the \u201cdocument was actively discussed and reviewed\u201d and that it \u201chad a broad discussion as the wording of several points were more accurately described\u201d (from the Shepherd\u2019s write up), I think that this document may not be ready to be an Internet Standard. The obvious solution to this DISCUSS is to change the intended status to Proposed Standard.",

While that might sound a bit far-fetched we have seen exactly that kind of issue with HTTPS that had practical impact on Webdav. (The TLS renego and then triple handshake attacks.) So while using TFO may not enable a slam-dunk CVE level 10 attack, I think you do need to consider and talk about it. (Or maybe you did and figured out no attack can work, but then I'd guess you'd be so happy, you'd say that too:-) I'm not sure how this'd best be resolved, but one thing might be to talk to the folks thinking about TCPINC as they have at least hit this as a potential issue for tcpcrypt and for tcp-use-tls.
