I initially thought it was OK, because this is an abstract type, and maybe it's defined elsewhere.\u00a0 But I picked an item defined in the registry as \"string\" (96, applicationName) and checked the reference for that ( RFC 6759 , a nice, recent one), and I see nothing there that specifies the encoding either. What encoding is actually used, and where is that specified unambiguously? -- References -- \u00a0  The process for modifying [IPFIX-IANA] has been improved, and is \u00a0  now described in [IPFIX-IE-DOCTORS] Given that a substantive part of  RFC 5102  is now in the IE-DOCTORS doc, I can't understand why that's an informative reference here.\u00a0 Why should it not be normative? And do you really mean to cite the 1993 version of ISO 10646-1, rather than a more recent one (like maybe 2012)?\u00a0 (And for that matter (this part is non-blocking), why use an ISO reference for ASCII, rather than ANSI X3.4, or even  RFC 20 ?)",
