The YANG doctor's comments about default values for \"local\" configuration (e.g., graceful-restart configuration) causing the global configuration to never take effect should also be addressed. Please include some justification for why LDP IPv6 is considered an \"extended feature\" (which is particularly surprising given that Section 2 classifies \"IP\" to refer to both IPv4 and IPv6 together). We need to define the format/semantics of the md5-key string (e.g., is it hex? base64{url,}?) either directly or by reference (as the YANG doctor notes).\u00a0 Using a crypto-type would probably be appropriate, as would adding a note that tcp-md5 is obsoleted by TCP-AO. In the peer-af-policy-container grouping's label-policy/advertise/prefix-list, we need to say if the filter is for inclusion or exclusion of outgoing label advertisements. Similarly for the incoming label advertisements in the 'accept' container (and most of the -list-ref usages?). In the policy-container grouping's label-policy/assign/independent-mode/prefix-list, the description suggests that the contents will provide not just a list of prefixes that act as a filter, but also a map from prefix to label.\u00a0 This is a qualitatively different usage than the previous occurrences of prefix-list-ref, and it seems like a different type may be needed for it.\u00a0 Similarly for ordered-mode. (pro-forma) This document has 6 authors, and per  RFC 7322 , as this is more than five, we are supposed to consider whether that's appropriate.
