However, I am concerned that the document provides an authorization-by-possession model for clients to access their policies, delivers the policy URLs in the same DHCP and XML structures as other location URLs, and also acknowledges that there is a legitimate need for other entities to access policies: \u00a0  This document does not describe \u00a0  how policy might be provided to entities other than for location \u00a0  configuration, for example, in responses to dereferencing requests \u00a0  [ I-D.ietf-geopriv-deref-protocol ] or requests from third parties \u00a0  [ RFC6155 ]. I predict that policy URLs will be leaked, intentionally, to those who need them, and that this will lead to security issues down the road. Is there something that we could do about this?",
