In this case, I'm explicitly worried about the threat actor identity confidence, as that has possibly severe impacts, so the resolution here could differ from what results from Alissa's discuss.) (2) 3.18.1 - you provide a way to specify e.g. an address and netmask, or v6 prefix. But you don't specify any way to say that some of the address (or prefix) bits are not real or are additionally masked for privacy reasons. E.g. If everyone in 2001:1:1:beef::/64 is misbehaving, but I don't (yet) want to specify the exact prefix, I might want to say \" some 2001:1:1:xxxx::/64\" is misbehaving, meaning one /64 in 2001:1:1::/48 is being bad and not the entire /48.
