The text as written seems to normatively require implementation of that RFC to enable the \"caching\" feature. Did the working group discuss the implications of that? (I also note that this doesn't appear to have been called out at IETF last call. While there has been some discussion about relaxing that requirement, I'm not sure this is an appropriate place to do so.) 2) Section 8.5 contains the \"In an environment where any such protection is required\" language that has been discussed for several CDNI drafts. But in this particular case, the implication that there may be environments where such protection is _not_ required seems to conflict with the multiple occurrences of \"MUST use strong encryption/mutual authentication\" in sections 8.1-8.4.",
