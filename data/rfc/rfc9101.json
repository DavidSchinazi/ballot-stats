There seem to be some pretty serious namespacing issues that are not discussed at all in this document.\u00a0 Specifically, using JWT as a container for OAuth 2.0 authorization request parameters (including extension parameters) introduces the usage of many new names (of JSON name/value pairs) into the JWT claims namespace.\u00a0 Furthermore, the addition is not bounded, as any new OAuth extension parameters are implicitly permitted to be used as well!\u00a0 The IANA Considerations make no mention of the collapsed namespace for JWT claims and OAuth 2.0 (authorization request) parameters, leaving substantial potential for collisions in the future. Relatedly, using \"application/jwt\" as the Content-type of the HTTP response from dereferencing the request_uri with no explicit indication of the type/profile of JWT used (whether in the content type or in the JWT claims themselves) gives some risk of misinterpretation of the content.\u00a0 Consider, for example, when that request_uri is dereferenced not by the authorization server in the process of fulfilling an authorization request, but instead by some other service that expects a different type of JWT.
