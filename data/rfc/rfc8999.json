        "text": "Hi, A trivial discuss that should hopefully be easy to resolve, and it is plausible that the resolution may end up being in the QUIC transport document: In this document, the unused bits are defined as: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Figure 4: Version Negotiation Packet \u00a0  Only the most significant bit of the first byte of a Version \u00a0  Negotiation packet has any defined value.\u00a0 The remaining 7 bits, \u00a0  labeled Unused, can be set to any value when sending and MUST be \u00a0  ignored on receipt. In the QUIC transport document, they are defined as this: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Figure 14: Version Negotiation Packet \u00a0  The value in the Unused field is selected randomly by the server. \u00a0  Clients MUST ignore the value of this field.\u00a0 Servers SHOULD set the \u00a0  most significant bit of this field (0x40) to 1 so that Version \u00a0  Negotiation packets appear to have the Fixed Bit field. I would have expected that these two should be consistent as to whether the Fixed Bit SHOULD be set to 1 or not.\u00a0 Given  draft-thomson-quic-bit-grease-00 , it might be better if the SHOULD is removed from QUIC transport, but I will defer to the experts here.
