By the time we get to the Telechat (tomorrow!) my comments may have already been taken over by events; if so, I will clear. If asked to decide I would have leaned towards Informational \u2014 there is lot of content describing the problem and an architecture (not a solution).\u00a0 I think Adrian made more persuasive points towards Informational (probably not his intent) in one of his messages to the teas WG [1]. The document does present the best thinking of the WG at this point, but I think it falls short of explicitly documenting the \"the best way to perform some operations\" [ rfc2026 ].\u00a0 In fact, the current way to implement the architecture is left to an Appendix. If the resulting Status remains as BCP (or even Standards Track), then I would like to support Brian Carpenter (Gen-art reviewer) in his request for the document to call out which sections are not normative (5 \u2013 Building on Existing Protocols and 9 \u2013 Scoping Future Work, are high on my list).\u00a0 This action shouldn't require more than a couple of sentences. Just to recap.\u00a0 This DISCUSS is for the IESG to talk\u2026\u00a0 I don't expect any action from the authors at this point \u2014 maybe just help the IESG in the discussion\u2026 [1]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/teas/ql2RDMcvMZZU9KPKTdKijIqMtBA [2]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gen-art/yDlSiKhKzkEhrXbuXSJtdYivhbc [3]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/teas/qMbaZkMi4iJMAzZPq8SYrxMmtPg [4]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/teas/aq8YSEDr6BP6V1MdN4ZNTJUQd4k [5]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gen-art/kMwMDZ8nU8t4dKKI1ImN3l6YdbY",
