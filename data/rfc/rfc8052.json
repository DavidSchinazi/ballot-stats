(Or at least I didn't find a version I could access.) That's made worse by my relative ignorance of GDOI as well.  So I wonder should the authors or IESG add a note to that effect? Say along the lines of: \"This memo extends  RFC6407  in order to define extensions needed by IEC62351-9. With the current IANA registry rules setup by  RFC6407 , this requires a standards action by the IETF - essentially that means the production of this document. As the relevant IEC specifications are not available to the IETF community, it is not possible for this RFC to fully describe the security considerations applying. Implementers therefore need to depend on the security analysis within the IEC specifications. As two different SDOs are involved here, and since group key management is inherently complex, it is possible some security issues have not been identified, so additional analysis of the security of the combined set of specifications may be advisable.\" I'd be fine with any wording that calls out that the IETF can't really be sure of the overall outcome here. Note that that's not in any way to doubt the authors' own analysis - but given that we know it is quite possible for fewer eyeballs to lead to gaps, and that this really is a complicated beast solving a complicated problem, I'm a bit concerned that we may miss something.",
