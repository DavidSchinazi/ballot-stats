That is, I would expect to see in sections 2.1,\u00a0 2.2, and 2.3 the list of which documents are updated by each section. I realize this can be intuited, but typically for avoidance of doubt authors specify precisely which updates apply to which documents. This will also clear up the unused references that idnits is pointing out. I would also like to\u00a0 understand why this is going for BCP. There is effectively no shepherd write-up for this draft (it's just a copy of the write-up for  draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf  and talks about this document as the \"companion\" document) so there is no explanation there. One effect of this being BCP is that it adds a huge number of documents to the downref registry. It's not clear to me that the upside of that is bigger than the downside.",
