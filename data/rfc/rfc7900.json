Status: Not ready,\u00a0 three major concerns and two editorial nits:\u00a0  Major concerns: 1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Specification of the Extranet Source Extended Community and Extra Source extended Community Please provide the type of detail as show in  RFC 4360  sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.\u00a0  2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why is there no Deployment considerations section?  The whole draft is a set of rules for handling policy, BGP A-D routes, tunnel set-up, and PIM Join/leaves in the case of an intra net.\u00a0 Unless these rules are followed exactly, traffic may flow into a VPN it is not suppose to. If the customer and the SP must coordinate on setting up filters, the procedure is outside the document. An error in any of these set-ups is considered a \u201csecurity violation\u201d.  Milo Medin stated \u201cwith enough trust\u201d a rock can fly to the moon.\u00a0 However, the NASA flights were fragile and risky.\u00a0 In the journey to the moon, there was no other choice.\u00a0 Instrumentation has 4-5 backups. In this set-up, one has to ask \u201cis there another choice\u201d to this whole design that seem fragile addition of extranets to an intra-AS multicast design.\u00a0 If the design is not fragile, then there should be a deployment section indicating how to manage the RTs, RDs, and policy set-up.\u00a0 Perhaps experience with the Intra-As has shown deployment tips that would make this less fragile.\u00a0 If so,\u00a0 it would be good to include an operations consideration section. If a new class of tools provides monitoring or provisioning, mentioning these would be useful.\u00a0 If yang modules are being developed, that would be useful. Places that indicate issues with violated constraint: p. 11, 12, 19 (2.3.2 \u2013 a priori knowledge, inability to detect), , p. 25 last paragraph (violation of constraints will cause things to not work.\u00a0 However, only policy can control), p. 27 4.2.2 (1st paragraph, Route Reflector must not change), p. 31 (5.1, first paragraph), 3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Is security section really a security section? It seems more like \u201cdo this policy\u201d or this will fail.\u00a0 It should get a stronger review from the security directorate",

Mention of the possibility of active attacks that could alter or tamper with the traffic or passive attacks that could observe the traffic as a risk due to lack of encryption (confidentiality protection) would help or a reason why this doesn't matter.
