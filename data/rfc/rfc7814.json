        "text": "Thank you for a clear and well-written document.\u00a0 I have one point that is peripheral to most of the draft. In Section 4.3, it says:  \" In addition, for any other \u00a0  applications that generate intra-subnet traffic with TTL set to 1, \u00a0  these applications may not work properly in the Virtual Subnet \u00a0  context, unless special TTL processing for such context has been \u00a0  implemented (e.g., if the source and destination addresses of a \u00a0  packet whose TTL is set to 1 belong to the same extended subnet, \u00a0  neither ingress nor egress PE routers should decrement the TTL of \u00a0  such packet.\u00a0 Furthermore, the TTL of such packet should not be \u00a0  copied into the TTL of the transport tunnel and vice versa).\" The idea of not decrementing TTL is quite concerning.\u00a0 I can conjecture cases where there is a routing loop between the relevant PEs - during reconvergence when a host moves from one datacenter to another is a trivial case.\u00a0  One approach may be to ask why a packet would have a TTL of 1 and determine if this case must be resolved.\u00a0 Another might detecting a loop back to an out-of-datacenter PE and dropping the packet.\u00a0 I'm sure you can develop other good ideas and solutions.",

I don't get why there isn't a MUST-like statement here for such protection, and going a bit further, why some interoperable form of protection for such traffic (e.g. IPsec, MACsec) isn't recommended as being MTI in such cases. The huge variety of potentially and actually sensitive traffic being handled by VMs these days and which ought not be, and probably is not, understood by folks doing routing seems to very strongly imply that such protection should in fact be turned on all of the time. (But stating that would be going beyond current IETF consenus on MTI security as expressed in  BCP61 .\u00a0 It'd still be a good idea I think though.) (2) I'm guessing one reaction to the above discuss point could be \"sure, but this is the wrong document.\" In that case, please show me the right document and then tell me why a reference to that is not needed here.
