A very interesting piece of work and a well-written piece of text (even if I am balloting DISCUSS). The examples are also helping. Please find below some DISCUSS points (+ suggestions), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education). Special thanks to Michael Richardson for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the WG consensus *but* it lacks the justification of the intended status. It would have been nice to list the implementations (even if I know one). Please note that Tommy Pauly is the Internet directorate reviewer (at my request) and you may want to consider this int-dir reviews as well when Tommy will complete the review (no need to wait for it though): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-yang/reviewrequest/16806/ Also, thanks to the WG chairs and the responsible AD to bundle this I-D and its companion to the same IESG telechat: it helps a lot! I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ###  BCP14  template As noted by  https://author-tools.ietf.org/api/idnits?url=https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-opsawg-service-assurance-yang-10.txt  and Lars, the  BCP14  template is not correct even if it is required for a proposed standard (it mentions  BCP13  ;-) ). As I have further DISCUSS issues below, I am raising the trivial  BCP14  issue to a blocking DISCUSS. ### Section 3.3 To my SQL eyes, it hurts to use a -1 value for health-score when there is no value. There is no \"mandatory true\" statement for this leaf, i.e., it can be absent in the telemetry. Is there a semantic difference between the absence of health-score and the value of -1 ? Is the SAIN collector expected to process those 2 cases differently ? Suggest to either remove the -1 sentinel value, or add \"mandatory true\" attribute, or be specific about the difference (if any). ### Section 4 It is unclear from this section whether it applies to IETF-specified YANG modules only? I.e., may a vendor augment this IETF YANG module in its own namespace ? I guess so, but worth writing it (or restrict this section to future IETF work only).",
