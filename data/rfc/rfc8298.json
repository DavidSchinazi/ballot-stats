        "text": "I'm confused about whether the text in this document is intended to form a normative description of SCReAM. The document contains the following statement: \u00a0  Note that the pseudo code does not show all \u00a0  details for reasons of readability, the reader is encouraged to look \u00a0  into the C++ code in [SCReAM-CPP-implementation] for the details. This effectively states that the cited C++ code forms the normative specification of the SCReAM algorithm, and that this document is a non-normative companion to help understand the normative code. If this is the case, then: - The [SCReAM-CPP-implementation] reference needs to be moved from \"Informative References\" to \"Normative References\",  - The abstract and introduction need to make it much clearer that the normative definition of the SCReAM algorithm is a body of C++ code rather than the prose and psuedocode in this document, and - We need to coordinate with the RFC editor to ensure proper archival of the code at [SCReAM-CPP-implementation]. At this time,  github.com  does not meet the standards of archival quality that the RFC series is expected to meet. If the C++ implementation is *not* the normative definition of SCReAM, then the psuedocode and definitions in this document need to be complete and sufficient to implement the algorithm; and, in particular, it cannot omit algorithm details \"for reasons of readability.\"",
