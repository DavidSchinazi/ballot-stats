This is closely related to my second discuss point for 2910bis: Section 4.1.8 says \"IPP implementations SHOULD accept any \u00a0  request with the major version \u20191\u2019 or \u20192\u2019, or reject the request if \u00a0  the operation is not supported.\" The SHOULD level requirement for \"forward\" compatibility seems unusual. How is that different than saying implementations SHOULD implement 2.X and be backwards compatible to 1.1? If it's the same thing, then should have text discouraging new implementations of 1.1?",
