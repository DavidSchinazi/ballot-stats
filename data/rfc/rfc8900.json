Section 6.1 says: \"Developers MAY develop new protocols or applications that rely on IP \u00a0  fragmentation if the protocol or application is to be run only in \u00a0  environments where IP fragmentation is known to be supported.\" I'm wondering if there should be a bit more nuance here to make the recommendation clearer. Do we think there is a case where an application protocol developed in the IETF will be known to only run in environments where fragmentation is supported? If we don't think developing such a protocol would be in scope for the IETF, then I'm wondering if that case should be called out explicitly with a stronger normative requirement.",
