        "text": "I have a couple of questions and observations I'd like to discuss. (1) From Section 3: \"The scenarios serve as examples.\u00a0 This document does not restrict the \u00a0  applicability of the THIRD_PARTY_ID to certain scenarios.\u00a0 The \u00a0  THIRD_PARTY_ID can include any Layer-2 identifier like a MAC address \u00a0  or other subscriber identifiers as, for example, mentioned in section \u00a0  6 of [ I-D.boucadair-pcp-sfc-classifier-control ].\u00a0 The THIRD_PARTY_ID \u00a0  can also be used for the firewall control, including the case of a \u00a0  virtual CPE, see section 3 of [ I-D.lee-vhs-usecases ].\" I think the document makes a reasonable case for why carrying a tunnel ID in a THIRD_PARTY_ID option is useful. I don't think it makes a reasonable case for any other use of the option, though, given the potential security and privacy issues associated with sending a potentially unique and permanent subscriber identifier. The drafts mentioned above envision much broader uses for both the option and PCP than the use case in this document, and suggest some uses of the option that seem like a mismatch for what the identifiers embedded within it were originally intended for (e.g., using an IMSI for traffic classification/policing).  Conflating these cases also makes it difficult to understand how the THIRD_PARTY_ID relates back to NAT. Presumably, a PCP-controlled NAT needs traffic on the incoming side to always include the THIRD_PARTY_ID -- otherwise, the fact that the mapping table contains the additional ID is only useful in one direction. This seems workable when the THIRD_PARTY_ID is a tunnel ID, but not for any identifier that anyone might stick in there. Again coming back to the traffic policing scenario, it seems unlikely that every time I as the subscriber send traffic through the NAT, my IMSI will be included to differentiate my traffic from another subscriber who has the same internal address as I do. So by allowing this field to contain any identifier, it becomes less obvious why PCP should be used to communicate it in the first place. In short, I think this draft needs to either more narrowly specify a means to communicate a tunnel ID, or provide both a more thorough security and privacy analysis of the implications of sending any identifier and an explanation of the implications on the availability of those identifiers in traffic sent to a PCP-controlled NAT. (2) Section 5.2 seems underspecified.  RFC 6887  has a lot logic riding on the question of whether two requests are meant to identify the same host or not (in sec 11.3 and sec 12.3) based on the combination of internal address, protocol, and port, but this draft leaves unspecified what the comparison logic is supposed to be or the error conditions that result from adding another field to the determination of whether two hosts are the same or not. For example, is every instance of \"internal address, protocol, and port\" in those sections meant to be replaced with \"internal address, protocol, port, and THIRD_PARTY_ID\"? If a device that already has a mapping for a particular internal address, port, protocol and THIRD_PARTY_ID receives a new request for the same internal address, port, and protocol but has no THIRD_PARTY_ID, what steps is it supposed to follow? Saying that the THIRD_PARTY_ID should be \"used in addition when accessing a mapping table\" doesn't seem like enough detail to go implement this.",

It is a basic issue of building equipment that can interoperate, involving clients and servers and so on from multiple vendors. I have no specific suggestion for a fix, but further standardisation of the formats for typical values while leaving some room for opaque identifiers would perhaps be one avenue.",

What's the purpose of using a stable identifier except to facilitate tracking? if that's the case then it should be a spelled out,\u00a0 a pcp interworking function could use basically anything to distinguish between two hosts when requesting a mapping, e.g. the mapping is bound to ip addresses. Extending the the option to applications outside of the L2 domain (as described in section 3) proposes to extended the use of this mac based identifier still further, which seems like an opportunity for information leakage outside the scope of the L2 domain, when ephemeral or session based identifiers might be more appropriate.",
