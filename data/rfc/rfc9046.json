        "text": "Section 2 says that the \"DTLS certificate values\" are required to return no value when read, but this property seems to be intended for private data such as DTLS private key values, not the certificates themselves (which are public). While I appreciate that IPv6 is the current version of the internet protocol, I do see that 6126bis allows for Babel to run over both IPv6 and IPv4, yet this document in multiple places implicitly assumes that Babel runs over IPv6, to the exclusion of IPv4.\u00a0 Such a restriction from the core protocol spec should only be undertaken by an information model with clear reasoning and loud disclaimer. Similarly (as Roman notes), we are putting requirements on the key length for MAC keys (relative to the block size of the underlying hash function) that have were once present in  draft-ietf-babel-hmac  but have been removed as of draft-ietf-babel-hmac-10.\u00a0 I assume that the intent is not to impose additional restrictions compared to the protocol spec, thus we need to catch up to those changes. The description of the babel-mac-key-test and babel-cert-test operations need to be tightened up, as the secdir reviewer noted.\u00a0 (See COMMENT.) We seem to be using terminology from the Network Management Datastore Architecture without reference or otherwise introducing the concepts. This is a Discuss point because the only candidate reference I know of, RFC 8342 , is specific to YANG and data models, so it's applicability for use in an information model may be subject to discussion.\u00a0 (Hopefully this only reflects my ignorance and not a fundamental lack of datastore architecture for information models.)",
