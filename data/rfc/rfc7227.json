This section also fails to consider the drawbacks of using addresses for configuration.\u00a0 Most obviously, address-based configuration is brittle -- if I add a SIP server to my cluster, should I have to force all the DHCP clients to renew their leases?\u00a0 There's also a security benefit to using domain names, since it's much more common to have credentials tied to domain names than to IP addresses. I would strongly urge the WG to reconsider the advice in this section.\u00a0 The considerations listed are worth noting, but in practice, they are far outweighed by the benefits of using FQDNs.",

If some DHCP options (old or new) expose personally identifying information (PII) and are sent in clear or broadcast/multicast then that's presumably not a great thing. Shouldn't you tell people to avoid doing that unless there's a good reason or something? (If there are such options already then it might be good to list some of those and comment on them too as you've done in other cases.) (2) The security considerations recognises that DHCP is basically used in clear, but doesn't that mean you should recommend that DHCP options not contain values that are sensitive? E.g. presumaby it'd be dumb to try to define a new option that sent a client the key to a VPN except in some really weird circumstance?",
