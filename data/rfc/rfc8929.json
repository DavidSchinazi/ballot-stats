        "text": "Thanks for this -- it was a good read.\u00a0 I just have a few super-boring poitns of apparent internal inconsistency to fix before publication. There seems to be an internal inconsistency relating to the handling of link-local addresses by a Bridging Proxy: Section 8 descriptively says that such addresses are (always) registered (\"[t]he Bridging Proxy registers any Binding including for a Link-Local address to the 6LBR\"), but Section 9 has this behavior as optional (\"[a] Bridging Proxy MAY register Link Local addresses at the 6BBR and proxy ND for these addresses over the backbone\"). Similarly, I see Section 6 saying that when a 6BBR generates an NA in response to an NS(DAD), it \"MUST have the Override flag set\", but Section 9.2 says \"MUST be answered ... the Override flag not set\" (for the \"different registration\" case, i.e., second bullet) and nothing at all about the Override flag for the \"not as fresh\"/\"Moved\" case (i.e., the third bullet).\u00a0 Am I misreading something? Continuing the theme, Section 10 notes that a \"Registering Node SHOULD register all of its IPv6 Addresses to its 6LR, which is the 6BBR when they are connected at Layer 2\", but Appendix B states the stronger condition that \"[t]he 6BBR assumes that if a node registers at least one IPv6 Address to it, then the node registers all of its Addresses to the 6BBR.\"",
