While this problem has been discussed in rtgwg, I do not yet see consensus in the Routing Area that this is the agreed solution.\u00a0 The email sent by v6ops about this problem recommended src-dest-routing as a solution and, indeed, that is being investigated. At a minimum, the language in this section needs to change from SHOULD.",
