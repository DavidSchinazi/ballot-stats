The originator DetNet node MUST set the value of the Sequence Number field before the transmission of a packet. the initial value SHOULD be random (unpredictable). The originator node MUST increase the value of the Sequence Number field by 1 for each active OAM packet.\" (3.2) \"For a DetNet active OAM packet, PREOF MUST use the bit string from bit 4 through bit 31 inclusive of the first 32-bit word of the d-ACH, i.e., the concatenation of Version, Sequence Number, and Channel Type fields, as the source of this sequencing information. In that, DetNet OAM uses a 28-bit field for sequencing and is conforming to Section 4.1 of [ RFC8964 ]. So if a POF is using a 28-bit integer for sequencing, but the OAM sender is incrementing bit 16 on every packet, doesn't that create huge gaps in the sequence space?",
