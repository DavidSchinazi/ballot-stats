Obsoleting an informational implementation description seems a bit weird. Just would like to double-check with the rest of the IESG if that action appropriate...? Also obsoleting and moving to historic is not the same thing. The document says: \"This document recommends the reclassification of [ RFC4757 ] as Historic.\" One of the two actions (obsoleting or moving to historic) is enough. While I think moving to historic might actually be more appropriate than obsoleting an implementation description, it should only be moved to historic if this is not used and deployed anymore. Also moving to historic also requires a status change action.",
