Since this uses the \"+xml\" structured syntax suffix, it has to comply with the fragment identifier considerations associated with that suffix. See: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml In particular, +xml has requirements around citing section 5 of  RFC 7303 (which this document doesn't), as well as requiring support for element() fragments; e.g.: \u00a0 coap:// example.com/temp#element(/1/3) must be allowed as an alias for \u00a0 coap:// example.com/temp#rec=3 If you want to restrict other aspects of XPointerFramework fragment identifiers, I believe you'll have to say so explicitly.",

COMMENT Section 4.4 Just \"Considerations\" is an unusual subject title. Having no Unit and no Base Unit is allowed, but you don't say what the semantics are in that case (presumably just a dimensionless counter for integers, with units not really being applicable to non-numeric types).\u00a0 Interestingly, Section 5.1.7 deems it fit to use \"/\" for the unit for a boolean value, even though \"/\" is supposed to be a (continuous/floating-point) ratio. Section 4.5 Just to double-check: you really do want to privilege this specification's version for eternity, for the purpose of being omitted from resolved records? Section 12.1 is there not some other units registry we can use?\u00a0 I fear begetting  https://xkcd.com/927/ \u00a0 .\u00a0 Also, how is/should the table be sorted? Also in Section 12.1, number 9, is the need for case sensitivity in Units (or otherwise?) normatively covered anywhere?\u00a0 If not, should it? Section 12 Are Base fields supposed to get negative CBOR labels (and not other fields)?\u00a0 Is this mentioned explicitly somewhere? (Yes, I know that the intent is for no more CBOR lablels to be allocated, but that is only a SHOULD-level requirement.) In \u00a0  Extensions that are mandatory to understand to correctly process the \u00a0  Pack MUST have a label name that ends with the '_' character. should that say something about \"mandatory to understand but not defined in this document\"?\u00a0 (Also in 12.3.1 et seq?) Section 13 Why are we talking about \"executable content\" at all?\u00a0 It seems quite unrelated to the rest of the document.",
