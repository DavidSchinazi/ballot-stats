The introduction of the SRMS is also introducing a new way for a protocol participant to make claims about route prefixes directed at \"third parties\" (non-MS, non-MC routers).\u00a0 While routing protocols in general do require high levels of trust in all participants in order for proper routing to occur, this addition seems to create a \"first among equals\" situation that could be called out more clearly in the security considerations.\u00a0 (I do appreciate that the requirement for preferring SIDs advertised in prefix reachability advertisements over those advertised in mapping server advertisements does help alleviate some of the risk.)",
