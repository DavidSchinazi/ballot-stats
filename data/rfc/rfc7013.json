        "text": "(1) 4.3: Why does a CISCO-specific informational RFC end up generating a MUST NOT in a BCP with a set of experts for the vendor-specific protocol whose views are \"exempt\" from review by the reviewers for the IETF standards track protocol? I don't understand why that's appropriate. I would suggest just deleting the last paragraph of 4.3 entirely. Same for the last para of 5.2 and the 3rd last in 5.3 and in section 7, checklist 1, point 8, and section 7, checklist 2, item 10. In an offlist conversation with Ron we figured the changes  below might suffice - they look good to me but I need to just check they hits all the bits and make sure they're clear enough for an editor.

        "text": "I am a little concerned about the advice in Section 4 bullet 2 as being interpreted closer to a MUST than a MAY. Surely the important think is that the Reviewer consider this in the context of the application and then does the right thing for the application and its context.  I think that it would be useful if advice to that effect was more prominent in the document that is currently the case. As I read the advice it is very much written from the traditional use/flow reporting perspective, rather than from the point of view of a general use push protocol, and this conservative approach I think limits the potential of the IPFIX protocol.",
