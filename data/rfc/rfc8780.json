Orderings with \u00a0  respect to the other following objects are irrelevant. The prose and the figure do not exactly match up in this regard (is WA optional or mandatory; does\u00a0 need to be the first of the optional objects?). \u00a0 \u00a0  . Wavelength Selection TLV (32 bits): See Section 4.2 for \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 details. Either this is a proper TLV, in which case it has 32 bits of tag and length plus an additional 32 bits of value, for 64 bits total, or it is not a TLV and comprises solely of the \"value\" field of the Wavelength Selection Sub-TLV.\u00a0 Section 8.2 allocates a TLV type indicator for it, which suggests that the full TLV encoding is intended; where are the 32 bits for type and length reflected in this text and in the figure? Section 4.3 \u00a0  The Wavelength Restriction Constraint TLV type is TBD3 (See Section \u00a0  8.3). This TLV MAY appear more than once to be able to specify \u00a0  multiple restrictions. This is in conflict with the diagram in Section 4.1 (which does not appear to depict multiple occurrences).\u00a0 It's also unclear that the stated reasoning applies, since the RBNF indicates that ( ) can repeat, so the need for multiple TLVs is for different *action* (and count) rather than specifically for the wavelength restrictions. How are future \"Action\" values to be defined? \u00a0  Various encoding errors are possible with this TLV (e.g., not \u00a0  exactly two link identifiers with the range case, unknown identifier \u00a0  types, no matching link for a given identifier, etc.). To indicate \u00a0  errors associated with this type, a new Error-Type (TBD8) and an \u00a0  Error-value (Error-value=3) MUST be defined so that the PCE MUST \u00a0  send a PCErr message with a PCEP-ERROR Object. See Section 5.1 for \u00a0  the details. This normative language is not appropriate -- it in effect is only constraining the current document, so descriptive language of \"a new error type is assigned\" is more appropriate. What is the mechanism for extensibility of future Link Identifier sub-TLV types?\u00a0 Should there be a registry? Section 4.3.2 RFC 6205  says that the \"Identifier\" is a per-node assigned and scoped value that may change on a per-hop basis.\u00a0 I don't see where our base label gets scoped to a node (just that it's part of a PCReq message which does not seem scoped to a node), so this seems problematic. Section 4.4 \u00a0  The END-POINTS type generalized endpoint is extended as follows: \u00a0 \u00a0 ::=  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  [...] Where is the original\u00a0 definition that is being updated?\u00a0 (Why does this definition not include the  component from [PCEP-GMPLS]?)\u00a0 Why is there no Updates: relationship to reflect this extension?\u00a0 Is\u00a0 supposed to be the same TLV as defined in Section 4.3.2 without a separate containing PCEP object? Per [PCEP-GMPLS],\u00a0 is a TLV.\u00a0 Does that not also mean that  and  need to be (comprised of) sibling TLVs?\u00a0 This document allocates a TLV type for Wavelength Restriction Constraint in Section 8.3, but the references to RFC 7581  for\u00a0 and  seem to only be for the encoding of sub-TLVs, with sub-TLV values that live in the separate \"Types for Subfields of WSON Resource Block Information\" registry and are in a colliding namespace.\u00a0 Don't we need to allocate TLV values from the same place as\u00a0 (i.e., first-level PCEP TLVs) in order for this to be en/decodable? Section 4.4.1 \u00a0  The permitted sub-sub objects are the Optical Interface Class List \u00a0  and the Client Signal information whose encodings are described in \u00a0  Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 of [ RFC7581 ], respectively. Similarly to for the , don't we need to allocate XRO Subobject values in order for these structures to be semantically en/decodable? Section 4.4.2 \u00a0  This is supported by adding the sub-object \"WSON Processing Hop \u00a0  Attribute TLV\" defined for ERO in Section 4.2 [ RFC7689 ] to the PCEP \u00a0  IRO object [ RFC5440 ]. The referenced structure is defined as an RSVP-TE LSP attribute. I cannot find any evidence that its usage in PCEP is defined, nor any TLV or subobject type allocated for its usage with PCEP.\u00a0 (Is there some generic equivalence or mapping between (G)MPLS EROs and IROs and the PCEP analogues that I haven't encountered yet?)\u00a0 Don't we need to allocate an IRO Subobject value for this usage in a PCEP IRO object?\u00a0 Also, the WSON Processing Hop Attribute field is encoded as a sequence of sub-TLVs; if we want to reuse the same sub-TLVs from the existing usage, don't we need to document the linkage from the existing registry to the new usage somewhere? How does the error handling translate to PCEP usage? This seems rather underspecified. Section 5 I'm very confused by the structure definition.\u00a0 It claims to be the \"TLV data\", but also includes a type and length field so as to indicate that it is not just the data contents but the header as well.\u00a0 But the length field is truncated by a bit for use as the 'M' flag -- how can we modify the outer TLV header in this way?!\u00a0 Section 8.4 indicates that this type value is to be allocated from the \"PCEP TLV Type Indicators\" subregistry created by  RFC 5440 , that uses the full 2 bytes for the \"length\" field. Section 5.1 This section describes an Error-value=3 that is not reflected in Section 8.8 in the requests to IANA. Section 8.5 Isn't this mentioned in Section 4.4 (not 4.3)?
