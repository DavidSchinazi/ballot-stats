        "text": "I very much approve of the assertions set going ahead.\u00a0 I have a number of things I'd like to DISCUSS on this first: Point 1: -- Section 1.1 -- \u00a0  However, even when profiled for specific assertion types, additional \u00a0  profiling for specific use cases will be required to achieve full \u00a0  interoperability. In other words, even the SAML and JWT profiles aren't sufficient?\u00a0 Or do those documents do this sort of use-case profiling, resulting in something that can actually work?\u00a0 Or is Section 6 sufficient?\u00a0 If they do, or it is, then saying that here will help.\u00a0 (As a side note, I would really have preferred seeing at least the SAML draft in for IESG Eval at the same time as this doc.)  If they don't, then I'm dismayed.\u00a0 OAuth already requires out-of-band agreement on what sort of token one is going to get.\u00a0 This framework additionally requires out-of-band agreement on assertion type.\u00a0 If even those assertion types that are defined *further* require o-o-b agreement on the semantics of the fields they use, it seems that we're adding to the mess and not building broad interoperability.\u00a0  Point 2: Related to point 1, would it not be good to explicitly define an \"assertion type unsupported\" error response (or two: \"grant type unsupported\" and \"client assertion type unsupported\"), so a server can be explicit in saying that that is why this request can't be processed?\u00a0 If not, why not?\u00a0  Point 3: Might it be a good idea, concomitant with the suggested URNs in Sections 4.1 an 4.2, to reserve the namespaces \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:\" and \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:\" here, so they won't be used for anything else?\u00a0 If not, why not?\u00a0  Point 4: -- Section 5.2 -- I'm looking at the \"SHOULD be the client_id\"s in the first two bullets, and remembering the definition of \"SHOULD\" in  RFC 2119  -- it says that not following a SHOULD requires full understanding of the implications and careful weighing.\u00a0 I see nothing here that gives me a clue how to evaluate the implications.\u00a0 *Why* SHOULD these be the client_id, and what will happen if they're not?\u00a0 (This also applies to some of the bullets in Sections 6.x.)  Point 5: -- Section 5.2 -- \u00a0  o\u00a0 The assertion MAY contain an Assertion ID.\u00a0 An Authorization \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Server MAY dictate that Assertion ID is mandatory. How can a client know that an Authorization Server so dictates? Point 6: -- Section 6.1 -- \u00a0  When a client uses an assertion for authentication, it SHOULD do so \u00a0  according to Section 4.2. I'm confused: I thought 4.2 normatively described the protocol.\u00a0 What's that SHOULD here?\u00a0 (Same question applies to the intros to the other Sections 6.x.)",
