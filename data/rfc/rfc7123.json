        "text": "1. This document recommends filtering all IPv6 link-local traffic. Link-local IPv6 traffic is widely used on notionally IPv4-only networks. For example Apple's Bonjour protocol relies on IPv6 link-local addressing. So filtering this traffic would create significant operational problems even in supposedly IPv4-only networks. Bonjour is widely used even by non-Apple devices, including most IP printers and Microsoft Windows printer drivers, so even a non-Apple shop would have a problem with this recommendation. Proposed action: remove the first paragraph of section 2.1. Remove this text from the next paragraph: \u00a0  However, \u00a0  neither RA-Guard nor DHCPv6-Shield can mitigate attack vectors that \u00a0  employ IPv6 link-local addresses, since configuration of such \u00a0  addresses does not rely on Router Advertisement messages or DCHPv6- \u00a0  server messages. Remove this paragraph: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If native IPv6 traffic is filtered at layer-2, local IPv6 nodes \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 would only get to configure IPv6 link-local addresses. As an alternative, the authors could consider a much more restricted recommendation similar to the first paragraph of 2.1, but referring only to RA traffic and DHCPv6 traffic. This requires a fancier switch, but doesn't break Bonjour. A much less satisfactory alternative would be to simply say that breaking IPv6 at layer two breaks Bonjour. In combination with a very strong applicability statement (see point 2), I would feel compelled to clear this item in the DISCUSS, even though I would not actually be happy with the outcome. 2. This document makes broad recommendations about filtering tunnel traffic. These recommendations are appropriate in an enterprise environment where IPv6 is not yet deployed, but are inappropriate in most other contexts (e.g., it would be very damaging if ISPs started filtering all tunnel traffic). Proposed action: This document needs a very clear applicability statement at the top, before it even talks about any sort of recommendation of this type. There is a single sentence in the introduction about applicability, but this isn't sufficient.\u00a0  I would suggest something like the following: \u00a0  Most general-purpose operating systems implement and enable native \u00a0  IPv6 [ RFC2460 ] support and a number of transition/co-existence \u00a0  technologies by default.\u00a0  Support of IPv6 by all nodes is intended to \u00a0  become best current practice [ RFC6540 ].\u00a0 Some enterprise networks \u00a0  might, however, choose to delay active use of IPv6. \u00a0  This document describes operational practices for enterprise networks \u00a0  to prevent security exposure resulting from unplanned use of IPv6 on \u00a0  such networks. This document is only applicable to enterprise \u00a0  networks: networks where the network operator is not providing a \u00a0  general-purpose internet, but rather a business-specific network. The \u00a0  solutions proposed here are not practical for home networks, nor are \u00a0  they appropriate for provider networks such as ISPs, mobile providers, \u00a0  Wifi hotspots or any other public internet service. \u00a0  In scenarios in \u00a0  which the IPv6-capable devices are deployed on networks that are \u00a0  intended to be IPv4-only, native IPv6 support and/or IPv6 transition/ \u00a0  co-existence technologies could be leveraged by local or remote \u00a0  attackers for a number of (illegitimate) purposes.\u00a0 For example, Proposed alternative action: Some kinds of tunnel traffic are okay to filter in all environments, because their use is deprecated.\u00a0 If this document only referred to those types of traffic, this would also satisfy my concern. E.g., I don't think it's a problem to have a blanket recommendation to filter Teredo. 3. This recommendation breaks DNS: \u00a0  For this reason, networks attempting to prevent IPv6 traffic from \u00a0  traversing their devices should consider configuring their local \u00a0  recursive DNS servers to respond to queries for AAAA DNS records with \u00a0  a DNS RCODE of 3 (NXDOMAIN) [ RFC1035 ] or to silently ignore such \u00a0  queries, and should even consider filtering AAAA records at the \u00a0  network ingress point to prevent the internal hosts from attempting \u00a0  their own DNS resolution.\u00a0 This will ensure that hosts which are on \u00a0  an IPv4-only network will only receive DNS A records, and they will \u00a0  be unlikely to attempt to use (likely broken) IPv6 connectivity to \u00a0  reach their desired destinations. Suppose I do a AAAA query and an A query for a name that has non-AAAA records. Returning NXDOMAIN tels the resolver that there is no such domain name, not that there is no such record. The correct answer in this case is NOERROR, and an answer that contains no records. Silently ignoring these queries is bad advice as well, since it could potentially result in 90 second delays in accessing web pages on dual-stack servers. Happy Eyeballs is at this point a widely-deployed solution, present in all modern web browsers, so filtering AAAA records to route around brokenness is probably not needed. However, if the working group really has consensus to make a recommendation like this, it should at least do it in a way that doesn't break the DNS. Proposed action: Delete this paragraph. Alternative proposed action: specify that when filtering AAAA queries, the filtering entity needs to actually do the query, and then return no records if it receives an answer. This is a fairly easy thing to do on a DNS proxy. Explain why just returning NXDOMAIN or dropping the query will break DNS. If you go with the alternative proposed action, whatever text you put in should be vetted by the DNS directorate, because I'm just an amateur DNS geek and can't promise that I got the advice exactly right.",

The \u00a0  solutions proposed here are not practical for home networks, nor are \u00a0  they appropriate for provider networks such as ISPs, mobile \u00a0  providers, Wifi hotspot providers or any other public internet \u00a0  service. \u00a0  In scenarios in \u00a0  which the IPv6-capable devices are deployed on networks that are \u00a0  intended to be IPv4-only, native IPv6 support and/or IPv6 transition/ \u00a0  co-existence technologies could be leveraged by local or remote \u00a0  attackers for a number of (illegitimate) purposes.\u00a0 For example, Proposed alternative action: Some kinds of tunnel traffic are okay to filter in all environments, because their use is deprecated.\u00a0 If this document only referred to those types of traffic, this would also satisfy my concern. E.g., I don't think it's a problem to have a blanket recommendation to filter Teredo. 3. This recommendation breaks DNS: \u00a0  For this reason, networks attempting to prevent IPv6 traffic from \u00a0  traversing their devices should consider configuring their local \u00a0  recursive DNS servers to respond to queries for AAAA DNS records with \u00a0  a DNS RCODE of 3 (NXDOMAIN) [ RFC1035 ] or to silently ignore such \u00a0  queries, and should even consider filtering AAAA records at the \u00a0  network ingress point to prevent the internal hosts from attempting \u00a0  their own DNS resolution.\u00a0 This will ensure that hosts which are on \u00a0  an IPv4-only network will only receive DNS A records, and they will \u00a0  be unlikely to attempt to use (likely broken) IPv6 connectivity to \u00a0  reach their desired destinations. Suppose I do a AAAA query and an A query for a name that has non-AAAA records. Returning NXDOMAIN tels the resolver that there is no such domain name, not that there is no such record. The correct answer in this case is NOERROR, and an answer that contains no records. Silently ignoring these queries is bad advice as well, since it could potentially result in 90 second delays in accessing web pages on dual-stack servers. Happy Eyeballs is at this point a widely-deployed solution, present in all modern web browsers, so filtering AAAA records to route around brokenness is probably not needed. However, if the working group really has consensus to make a recommendation like this, it should at least do it in a way that doesn't break the DNS. Proposed action: Delete this paragraph. Alternative proposed action: specify that when filtering AAAA queries, the filtering entity needs to actually do the query, and then return no records if it receives an answer. This is a fairly easy thing to do on a DNS proxy. Explain why just returning NXDOMAIN or dropping the query will break DNS. If you go with the alternative proposed action, whatever text you put in should be vetted by the DNS directorate, because I'm just an amateur DNS geek and can't promise that I got the advice exactly right.",
