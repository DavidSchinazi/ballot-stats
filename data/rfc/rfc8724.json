(1) I'm concerned about Section 8.2.4's recommendation for the use of a sequential counter: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A sequence counter that is incremented for each new fragmented \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SCHC Packet, counting from 0 to up to (2^T)-1 and wrapping back to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0 is RECOMMENDED for maximum traceability and avoidance of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ambiguity. It seems like there may be substantial privacy and security considerations, here --  draft-gont-numeric-ids-history  has some background about similar cases in the past and links to other documents with analysis and guidance for future protocols.\u00a0 Shall we discuss to what extent those concerns apply here? (2) In Section 8.3.1.2, does the use of the All-1 fragment to signify the end of the packet, combined with the lack of an explicit \"number of fragments\" field, imply that the RCS value is the only thing (at this protocol level) preventing an attacker from inserting, from off-path, additional fragments between the penultimate \"legitimate\" fragment and the final fragment?\u00a0 (I understand that the LPWAN radio technologies generally do have some physical-layer cryptographic mechanisms, though they sometimes involve shared symmetric keys.)\u00a0 If the RCS is to play this pivotal a role, we need to at least document that, and arguably give stronger guidance about how it should be computed. (3) There are several places (noted, for the most part, in the Comment section) where we say that some field is optional.\u00a0 I think this means \"optional at the profile level\" as opposed to \"optional at runtime\", but we should be clear in the document about that. (4) There's an internal inconsistency in Section 8.4.3: \u00a0  In ACK-on-Error mode, windows are used.\u00a0 All tiles MUST be of equal \u00a0  size, except for the last one, which MUST be of the same size or \u00a0  smaller than the regular ones.\u00a0 If allowed in a Profile, the \u00a0  penultimate tile MAY be exactly one L2 Word smaller than the regular \u00a0  tile size. We need to reword this, as the subsequent text contradicts the initial \"MUST\".",
