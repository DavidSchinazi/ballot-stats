I do have a question that I think needs an answer: Regarding Section 4.2.2: \u00a0  o\u00a0 IPv6 header values: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 DSCP: set to 0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 Hop Count: set to 255 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0 Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP) Does anything about the IPv6 flow ID need to be stated here? As this is a path delay measurement, the value of the flow ID field has the potential to change the result. If one would use a new random value for each individual measurement in a sequence one may see different results than from using the same ID for all the measurements. Or is this specified in any of the references? In most case I would expect one use a single value, but likely randomly selected. However, it does depend on what purpose of ones measurement one have, thus I think this do matter.  I think this question applies to all measurements that are multi-packet ones so section 5, 7, 8 and 9 most definitely.  I also wonder if IPv6 Flow ID is an output parameter that needs to be kept?",
