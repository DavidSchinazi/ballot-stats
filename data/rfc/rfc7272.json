NEW:  No new mechanisms are introduced in this document to ensure  confidentiality between the RTP receiver/SC and RTP sender/MSAS.  Encryption procedures, such as those being suggested for a Secure  RTP (SRTP) [REFERENCE] at the time that this document was written,  can be used when confidentiality is a concern to end hosts.\u00a0 For example,  end hosts concerned that being correlated to the same stream as another  end host need to employ encryption between the RTP receiver and RTP  sender. Another thought is what happens if one end hosts is using SRTP with an appropriate algorithm suite but the other end host doesn't?\u00a0 Obviously, the correlation identifier is disclosed and I guess so is the media stream.\u00a0 Is there a way for end hosts to ensure that every other end host is also using SRTP before agreeing to use this protocol?",

In 8.\u00a0 RTCP Packet Type for IDMS (IDMS Settings) \u00a0  Packet Received NTP timestamp: 64 bits.\u00a0 This timestamp reflects the \u00a0  wall clock time at the reference client at the moment it received the \u00a0  first octet of the RTP packet to which this packet relates.\u00a0 It can \u00a0  be used by the synchronization algorithm on the receiving SC to \u00a0  adjust its playout timing in order to achieve synchronization, e.g. \u00a0  to set the required playout delay.\u00a0 The timestamp is formatted based \u00a0  on the NTP timestamp format as specified in [ RFC5905 ].\u00a0 See Section 9 \u00a0  for more information on how this field is used.\u00a0 Because RTP \u00a0  timestamps do wrap around, the sender of this packet SHOULD use \u00a0  recent values, i.e. choose NTP timestamps that reflect current time \u00a0  and not too far in the future or in the past. I don't understand the SHOULD in the last sentence. If a sender doesn't do this, is IDMS still going to work?  I'm curious because I'm reading the Security Considerations discussion about inadvertent or malicious reports of two-hour delays in one device resulting in two-hour delays in other synchronized devices.
