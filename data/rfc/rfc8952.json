(2) Section 4.1 says that: \u00a0  5.\u00a0 The Captive Portal API server indicates to the Enforcement Device \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  that the User Equipment is allowed to access the external \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  network. but I believe this should be the \"Captive Portal Server\" (or, as the previous point has it, the \"web portal\"). (3) Probably a \"discuss discuss\", but ... in Section 1 we have: \u00a0  *\u00a0 Solutions SHOULD NOT require the forging of responses from DNS or \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 HTTP servers, or any other protocol.\u00a0 In particular, solutions \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SHOULD NOT require man-in-the-middle proxy of TLS traffic. I'd like to understand the motivation for this one a little better.
