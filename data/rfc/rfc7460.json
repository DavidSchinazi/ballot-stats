As with others, I think these issues may affect more than one document here so we should consider them for the full eman wg output and even broader (for my point 2) and not just for one document.\u00a0  (1) I think this MIB is for a device that wants to tell the world all about its power consumption. Perhaps that is just not suitable for a device where the owner would prefer to be more discrete. Did the WG consider how to structure a MIB for that latter case?\u00a0 For example, is there any way to tell a device (via SNMP) that I am in fact such a privacy sensitive user and would prefer the device to be discrete, and e.g. aggregate measurements over much longer periods or report less fine grained values generally?\u00a0 If there is no such mechanism, why not? (2) On MIB privacy boilerplate: it is not clear to me that boilerplate is really the right thing here - one common way to handle privacy concerns is data minimisation which here could map to not exposing an element or to only exposing aggregate information rather than fine grained values. Those are things that have to be thought about by the MIB developers and can't just be handled via current SNMP security since once the data is out there the privacy breach has happened. (This point is broader than the eman WG of course so more for the AD and MIB doctors.)",
