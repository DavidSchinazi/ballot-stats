Section 7.2.1 in  RFC 6679  states An immediate or \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 early (depending on the RTP/AVPF mode) ECN feedback packet SHOULD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be generated on receipt of the first ECT- or ECN-CE-marked packet \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 from a sender that has not previously sent any ECT traffic.\u00a0 Each \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 regular RTCP report MUST also contain an ECN Summary Report \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Section 5.2).\u00a0 Reception of subsequent ECN-CE-marked packets MUST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 result in additional early or immediate ECN feedback packets being \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 sent unless no timely feedback is required. There are no specification in this document that says that on reception of ECN-CE marks the feedback packet should be sent using early or immediate. That might not be required given a correctly configured session, where reporting occur on the time scale. However, I think some discussion of the usage of early reporting for ECN-CE mark is needed if longer reporting intervals are used.  Where there any discussion in the WG of this subject?",
