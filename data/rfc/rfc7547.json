The way I read this, there is no statement about general access protections to the device outside of what is designated by a security administrator.\u00a0 I would think a statement on access controls on the device would be very important in consideration of safety concerns that put a strong need for security on such devices (medical, environmental monitors, etc.).\u00a0 Are there additional access mechanisms to the device besides what is possible by the management connection?\u00a0 Could there be factory defaults in place with local access work-arounds or even wireless int he even that there are issues accessing devices from management stations?\u00a0 Do these cause security problems?\u00a0 Are there ports other than those for management open that could lead to security breaches?\u00a0 Or are these out-of-scope because the discussion is about management connections?\u00a0 If it's out-of-scope, it would be good to state that it is even though that would be a concern.\u00a0 Text on this should be added to the security considerations section as a general discussion if it's a concern, but not in scope, similar to what was done for privacy.",
