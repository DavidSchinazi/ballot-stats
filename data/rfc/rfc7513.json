Achieving \u00a0  this is beyond the scope of this document.\" The first sentence says that trustworthy == not filtered, then the later sentence says that messages MUST be ensured to be trustworthy. The implication could be that messages MUST not be filtered, but that seems backwards. On the other hand, it doesn't seem right to have a normative requirement that messages be \"ensured to be trustworthy\" somehow, using some unspecified mechanism, without really explaining what counts as trustworthy. I would suggest deleting the second paragraph altogether unless it can be made meaningful for a network operator.",

The shepherd writeup notes that the reference to  RFC 7039  needs to be moved to informative.\u00a0 This is at DISCUSS-level because no downref was mentioned in the last call.\u00a0 But as part of this DISCUSS point, and before you make the reference informative: Is it really possible to understand this document without understanding what a binding anchor is (and, thus, without reading  RFC 7039 )? 2. In Section 4.3.5, if I understand the first paragraph correctly, you're saying that of the six types of binding anchors described in 7039, one of them -- the MAC address -- is insecure because it's too easily spoofed and one -- switch port -- is secure and recommended... and that the other four need more analysis before a recommendation can be made.\u00a0 Is that correct? The second paragraph then says that switch ports can be shared, and you recommend using an unshared binding anchor.\u00a0 Is that correct? When I put those together, I get a situation where the document can't give me any recommendation about what binding anchor to use (if my switch ports are shared).\u00a0 Why is that not a failure of the spec?\u00a0 Why is no analysys done, and recommendation made, with respect to the other four binding anchor types? 3. I think Sections 6 and 7 need quite a bit of work to be understandable and useful.\u00a0 See my comments below for my suggestions -- but those are only suggestions.\u00a0 The DISCUSS point is to get some sort of clarity there, and, of course, I'm happy to help if I can.",
