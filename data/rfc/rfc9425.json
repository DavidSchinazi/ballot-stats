        "text": "Thanks to Wes for his SECDIR review:  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-jmap-quotas-07-secdir-lc-hardaker-2022-11-17/ Some of his feedback seems to have already made it into the latest version of the document. I feel the types of quota limits has an interoperability issue ? There are three limits: limit, warnLimit and softLimit. First, it would make sense to rename the confusingly named \"limit\" to hardLimit. I was puzzled about warnLimit not being the same as softLimit. What other things does softLimit do than warn the user? Well, that is explained below this and turns out to be \"whatever the mailserver wants this to be\". This is not good for user expectations, unless they would get a detailed description along with the warning what things will get blocked at the softLimit level, as there is no longer a universal concept of what would happen at the softLimit level. The examples in the document do not seem to use the description field for this required user feedback. So when I get a warning from softLimit from Hotmail, this could cause different limitations from when I get a warning from Gmail. But as far as I can tell, the warning appears identical if the softLimit is hit? Or did I miss where custom text can be given to the enduser for such triggers?",
