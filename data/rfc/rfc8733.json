        "text": "This document seems generally useful, and thanks for it.\u00a0 I think there's a couple places where it's ambiguous or unclear, and hopefully we can tighten up the language without needing extensive changes. There may be an internal inconsistency in Section 2.3's definitions relating the Overflow-Count and the Overflow-Threshold: the description of Overflow-Count reads as if it is a reported quantity, but the description of Overflow-Threshold implies that Overflow-Count is a configured parameter.\u00a0 (Similarly for the Underflow- variants.) Specifically, the sentence \"[t]his value indicates how many times consecutively, the percentage or absolute difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the current bandwidth reservation of the LSP is greater than or equal to the Overflow-Threshold value\" uses the descriptive verb \"is\" as opposed to a conditional such as \"needs to be [...] in order to [...]\". Section 5.2.3.2 says: \u00a0  If the percentage difference between the current MaxAvgBw and the \u00a0  current bandwidth reservation is greater than or less than or equal \u00a0  to the threshold percentage, the LSP bandwidth is adjusted to the \u00a0  current bandwidth demand (MaxAvgBw) (as long as the difference in the \u00a0  bandwidth is at least or above the Minimum-Threshold). As written (\"greater than or less than or equal to\"), this is always true, which cannot be what was intended.\u00a0 Probably we should reword to just \"greater than\" and talk about the percentage absolute difference, i.e., 100 * abs(MaxAvgBw - CurrentRes) / CurrentRes .",
