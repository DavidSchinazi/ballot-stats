        "text": "I'm switching to a DISCUSS position until we address the comments that Dave Crocker has brought up in his review: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/msg83488.html Of particular concern are these: 1. ------------------------ > Because of this change in review assumptions, IETF Proposed > Standards should be considered to be at least as mature as final > standards from other standards development organizations. An assertion like this requires some discussion detail that compares the IETF process to specific, other SDO processes, both formally and effectively.\u00a0 I'm not disagreeing with the conclusion, but with its being made rather casually and firmly, but without substantiation. (Part of the real challenge in doing the comparison is looking for alternative forms of quality assurance that other SDOs might do, other than the explicit reviews the IETF does.) ------------------------ 2. ------------------------ > A Proposed Standard specification is stable, has resolved known > design choices, is well-understood, has received significant > community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to > be considered valuable. The text has two major flaws that serve to assert a much higher practical maturity for the Proposed Standard documents we publish than is very often observably true: Well understood: \u00a0  For a specification with any interesting level of innovation or complexity, it is almost never 'well understood' at the time it is approved by the IETF.\u00a0 That requires significant implementation, deployment and use experience. \u00a0  The fact that many eyes might have done a static review or even that a couple of folk have written some code or even that those folk interoperated does not come close to qualifying the specification as \"well understood\". Enough community interest: \u00a0  We often publish specifications that actually have very little community support.\u00a0 This is evidenced by a) very low working group participation levels, and b) failure to successfully deploy and get used. ------------------------ 3. ------------------------ > A Proposed Standard will have no known technical omissions with > respect to the requirements placed upon it.\u00a0 Proposed Standards are > of such quality that implementations can be deployed in the > Internet. And yet we know that this often is not true.\u00a0 However, language like this is going to cause the IESG to naturally raise the bar even higher, for fear that a spec still is not good enough. The real goal of the language change, here, is to give assurances that the specification is \"sufficiently\" mature, in terms of concern for market deployment. The part that the document can't say, but has as an implicit point since it is motivating the draft, is that the maturity is at least as good as that produced by other SDOs. ------------------------",
