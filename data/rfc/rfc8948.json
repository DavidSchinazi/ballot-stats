Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with IEEE 802.1CQ, nor am I a DHCPv6 expert ...\u00a0 Some of these questions/comments may have been answered there. My first question relates to process:\u00a0 Have members of the IEEE 802.1WG had an opportunity to review and provide input into this document?\u00a0 If not, then I think that it would be good for them to be given the opportunity to do so.\u00a0 In particular, they might question whether it is appropriate for a client to be able to request MAC addresses to be assigned from the SAI or \"reserved for future use\" address pools.\u00a0 It is worth noting that there is an IETF-IEEE liaison meeting on Mon 15th, that may help.  I'm not sure that I really like how the algorithm is defined in this document (relative to  draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign ).\u00a0 In  draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign , the client makes a request, and the server can respond with a completely different smaller MAC address range, i.e. the client is just providing hints/suggestions to the server.\u00a0 I would be much happier if the QUAD option specified in this document behaved similarly.\u00a0 I.e. the QUAD option is used by a client to specify an ordered preference of quads to use, but otherwise the server is allow to offer up an address, or block of addresses, outside the preferred quads, which the client could choose to not accept, or release.",
