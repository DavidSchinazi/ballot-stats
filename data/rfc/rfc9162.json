The synthesis of URLs by a protocol in this fashion is prohibited by  BCP 190 : \u00a0  Scheme definitions define the presence, format, and semantics of a \u00a0  path component in URIs; all other specifications MUST NOT constrain, \u00a0  or define the structure or the semantics for any path component. Unless the intention of this document is to update  BCP 190  to change this normative requirement, we can't publish it in its current form. Note that doing so would require a change of venue, as updates to  BCP 190  would not be covered by the current TRANS charter. Please see  BCP 190  section 3 for alternate approaches. All three approaches could be made to work for CT, and I would be happy to explain how to do so if clarification is desired.",

My comments and questions should be easy to address. = Section 10.2, 10.4, 10.5 = A Specification Required registry policy implies expert review. So a registry policy of \"Specification Required and Expert Review\" is duplicative; it should just say \"Specification Required.\" I know this seems trivial but there has been so much confusion about this through the years that it is important to be precise. = Section 10.3 = This section needs to state what the registry policy is for the code points not already registered (presumably Expert Review given 10.3.1, but it needs to be explicit). = Section 10.6.1 = Using the term \"Parameters Required\" as a capitalized term is confusing. FCFS registries by definition can require additional information to be provided in order to get something registered. For avoidance of confusion I think the assignment policy should be listed as First Come First Served and the requirement that parameters be included in the application can use a normative MUST in the last paragraph if there is concern that the parameters won't be supplied. However, I also wonder what will be done with the parameters that are supplied. Is IANA expected to just maintain them privately, or to publish them? What is expected to appear in the 'Log' column in the registry?",

        "text": "First off, thanks for this well-written document!\u00a0 I intend to ballot Yes, but there are a few issues that need to be resolved first. Sections 4.11 and 4.12 have arrays of NodeHash to carry consistency and inclusion proofs, respectively, with minimum array size of 1.\u00a0 However, Sections 2.1.4.1 and 2.1.3.1 (respectively) seem to admit the possibility of zero-length proofs in degenerate cases, which the aforementioned protocol description language forbids the conveyance of. (Section 5.3 explicitly requires the use of an empty consistency proof.) Do those minimum array sizes need to be (implicit) zero? (If they do not, it seems that a minimum size of 32 would have the same effect as that of one, since a NodeHash has minimum size 32.) I support Alexey's Discuss regarding the registration of a \"urn:ietf:params:trans:error\" URN namespace. In Section 6: \u00a0  o\u00a0 An Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [ RFC6960 ] response \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 extension (see Section 7.1.1), where the OCSP response is provided \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in the \"CertificateStatus\" message, provided that the TLS client \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 included the \"status_request\" extension in the (extended) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"ClientHello\" (Section 8 of [ RFC6066 ]).\u00a0 [...] This is not quite a TLS 1.3-compliant formulation -- TLS 1.3 does not use the \"CertificateStatus message\", but rather uses the encoding of that structure in a status_request extension in the CertificateEntry. I also think we need greater clarity on the (non-)usage of CT for TLS client certificates; see COMMENT I also support Alissa's Discuss.",
