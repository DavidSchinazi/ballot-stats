There seems to be an internal inconsistency in the normative guidance for how long a given cookie value should be accepted.\u00a0 Section 4.3 says that \"[t]he DNS Server SHOULD allow Cookies within 1 hour period in the past and 5 minutes into the future to allow operation of low volume clients and some limited time skew between the DNS servers in the anycast set\" (before going on to recommend that the server generates a new cookie if it receives one from the client that is more than half an hour old).\u00a0 In contrast, Section 5 says \"[t]he operator SHOULD wait at least longer than the period clients are allowed to use the same Server Cookie, which SHOULD be half an hour, see Section 4.3\".\u00a0 If I'm reading correctly the \"1 hour\" in Section 4.3 is supposed to line up with the \"half an hour\" in Section 5, but does not. Also, as was mentioned in the secdir review thread, I think we should clearly state what properties we require of a MAC in order to be a useful server cookie (including why the chosen inputs are the right thing to MAC!)\u00a0 That is, what message is being authenticated, and why is that a useful message to authenticate? I will also take this opportunity to consult the CFRG on the suitability of SipHash-2-4 for its stated purpose, though I do not feel a strong need to delay IESG approval of this document until a positive answer is received.",
