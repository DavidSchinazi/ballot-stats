The shepherd writeup says: \u00a0  This draft is being targeted for Informational status.\u00a0 While the \u00a0  draft recommends a number of timer values, they are suggested for \u00a0  interoperability while not mandating that any particular value be \u00a0  supported. \u00a0  There was discussion on the mailing list that while the draft was \u00a0  listed as Informational that some customers were likely to take the \u00a0  RFC as a base set of standard values - thus a de facto standard.  \u00a0  Consensus of the list seemed to judge that this was okay and provided \u00a0  values that implementors may want to look at targeting as part of \u00a0  their implementations. First of all, the values defined/specified (cf. Alia: not \"proposed\") in this document are described as \"SHOULD support all values in the set\". That seems perfectly reasonable, but that's a protocol requirement. (\"SHOULD\" does not mean \"OPTIONAL\".) Further, the WG itself is clear that this is likely to turn into a de facto standard anyway. IETF standards are voluntary anyway. If the BFD community has consensus that this is something that SHOULD be supported by 5880 implementations and that implementers are going to do it anyway, why not call it a Proposed Standard, mark it as updating 5880, and move along?",
