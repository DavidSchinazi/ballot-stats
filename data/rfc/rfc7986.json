Some that occur to me are: \u00a0  - names, descriptions and identifiers here are all ones that \u00a0 \u00a0  might allow (re)identification in unexpected ways \u00a0  - the UID property in particular probably ought be random and \u00a0 \u00a0  probably ought not be re-used for anything else, some  RFC2119 \u00a0 \u00a0  SHOULD statements about that would seem like they'd be good. \u00a0  - doing a refresh against a calendar at the expected frequency \u00a0 \u00a0  could be a good way to re-identify someone - if I can read the \u00a0 \u00a0  expected frequency and some IP address connects (even all over \u00a0 \u00a0  TLS) at about that regularity then I can be reasonably sure \u00a0 \u00a0  that the client is someone subscribed to that address, and \u00a0 \u00a0  maybe use that to track a person's movement across various \u00a0 \u00a0  networks. (That's different from the text in section 7 which \u00a0 \u00a0  assumes that the URL is what's tracked, but the connection \u00a0 \u00a0  can be just as revealing, for some calendars.) I'm not trying to insist all that analysis be documented in this draft but I would hope that the WG have considered the issues and how best to document those and have a plan to do that. (If I'm told such a plan exists and what it is, I'll clear.) This is related to, but a little different from, Kathleen's discuss, depending on the added privacy considerations text which I've not managed to find in the secdir review thread.\u00a0 But this should be as easily cleared I'd guess.",
