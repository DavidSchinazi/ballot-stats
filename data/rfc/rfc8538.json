A suggested default value for the stale timer is 180 seconds. An implementation MAY provide the option to disable the timer (i.e., to provide an infinite retention time) but MUST NOT do so by default.\" The \"infinite retention time\" part of this makes me deeply uncomfortable -- I can see a good reason for the stale timer, and the default \"feels\" fine to me, but having an infinite retention time (or, really anything over 10 to 15 minutes) feels like a really dangerous idea, and that it will come back and bite.  I'm hoping that I'm missing something obvious, but can you please explain under what conditions an infinite retention policy makes sense? It seems like there would be multiple opportunities for blackholing traffic with this.",
