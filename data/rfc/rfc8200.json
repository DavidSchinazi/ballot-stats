(IPv6 Extension Headers), which leaves itself open to interpretation and should be cleaned up. (A)\u00a0 The main piece of text that has been discussed now reads: \u00a0  With one exception, extension headers are not examined, processed, \u00a0  inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery path, \u00a0  until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes, in \u00a0  the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of \u00a0  the IPv6 header.\u00a0 Note: If an intermediate forwarding node examines \u00a0  an extension header for any reason, it must do so in accordance with \u00a0  the provisions of [ RFC7045 ]. \u00a0  ... \u00a0  The exception referred to in the preceding paragraph is the Hop-by- \u00a0  Hop Options header, which carries information that may be examined \u00a0  and processed by every node along a packet's delivery path, including \u00a0  the source and destination nodes.\u00a0 The Hop-by-Hop Options header, \u00a0  when present, must immediately follow the IPv6 header.\u00a0 Its presence \u00a0  is indicated by the value zero in the Next Header field of the IPv6 \u00a0  header. \u00a0  NOTE: While [ RFC2460 ] required that all nodes must examine and \u00a0  process the Hop-by-Hop Options header, it is now expected that nodes \u00a0  along a packet's delivery path only examine and process the Hop-by- \u00a0  Hop Options header if explicitly configured to do so. While the first sentence seems clear on what this document wants forwarding nodes to do (or not), there are two notes that define exceptions: any forwarding node can examine the headers \"for any reason\", and, the Hop-by-Hop Options header doesn't really have to be examined and processed by everyone. This text needs some more work to at least not contradict itself: there is more than one exception, and they are not absolute, anyone can examine the headers \"for any reason\"... (B) As it stands, the note about the changed expectations for the Hop-by-Hop options header opens a significant door to work around the \"limitations\" of other options.\u00a0 For example, it would be relatively straight forward to define a new Hop-by-Hop option to carry any type of information that could then be \"examined, processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery path\".\u00a0 In the world of controllers and programmatic access to forwarding nodes, changing the explicit configuration on the fly to customize which nodes do what, is trivial. Is that the intent of this document, to provide a generic mechanism for cases that may need extension headers to be \"examined, processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery path\"?\u00a0 Will the WG/IETF be in a position to charter, adopt and/or publish these types of documents?\u00a0 I ask this question not only in the context of my concerns expressed above, but also because the definition of the Hop-by-Hop Option would seem to be able to handle anything (\"used to carry optional information that may be examined and processed by every node along a packet's delivery path\" - I didn't see any constraints), even if (for example) the Routing Header \"is used by an IPv6 source to list one or more intermediate nodes to be \"visited\" on the way to a packet's destination\" -- so it makes me wonder whether using the Hop-by-Hop Options header to carry (for example) routing information so that it can be \"examined, processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery path\" would pass the bar set in Section 4.8. (Defining New Extension Headers and Options): \u00a0  New hop-by-hop options are not recommended because nodes may be \u00a0  configured to ignore the Hop-by-Hop Option header, drop packets \u00a0  containing a hop-by-hop header, or assign packets containing a hop- \u00a0  by-hop header to a slow processing path.\u00a0 Designers considering \u00a0  defining new hop-by-hop options need to be aware of this likely \u00a0  behaviour.\u00a0 There has to be a very clear justification why any new \u00a0  hop-by-hop option is needed before it is standardized. In the context of a controlled domain, it should be relatively easy for the operator to account for those issues.\u00a0 So my interpretation of whether a Hop-by-Hop option is ok to carry (for example) routing information is a strong \"Yes!\".\u00a0 Whether my interpretation is what was intended or not, I believe the overall text could benefit from more clarity.",

        "text": "My discuss is mainly on text in section 4.8 (also based on the tsv-art review -> Thanks Martin!): I find the recommendation to basically just not use hop-by-hop headers in section 4.8 extremely unsatisfying. Can we maybe do better? Wouldn't it be maybe time to just deprecate the current hop-by-hop number an assign a new one? I know that also has deployment problem but maybe it's worth a try. I guess the assignment could happen in a new document though, but the deprecation could be done here. This related to this comment from Martin's review, also proposing a potential way forward: \"- Section 4.8. \"Defining New Extension Headers and Options\": It says new hop-by-hop headers must never ever defined. This is problematic, as this closing the door forever, even if future instances of the IETF do would like to wish to define new hop-by-hop headers. A better way would have to say \"that new hop-by-hop headers must have IETF consensus\". - Section 4.8. \"Defining New Extension Headers and Options\": Also the \u201enot recommended\u201c to define new extension headers looks strange, especially with the phrase \"There has to be a very clear justification\". The term \"clear justification\" is not an exact engineering specification. Why not using \"technical protocol specification and real word use case required, plus IETF consensus\"?\" As a side note, there is at least one experimental RFC that defines a destination option to be inspected by a network device, given the know problems of hop-by-hop option which renders them unusable.",
