A common practice is to hold such drafts behind the WG standards track work, so that it is clear to the reader which is the IETF preferred approach, and which is documenting an alternative approach proposed by another group of workers. Additionally we normally insist that this relative status is reflected in the title and abstract, again to avoid any ambiguity on the matter. My preferred approach would be to modify the title and abstract to reflect the relative status, include a normative reference to  draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe  and put the draft on hold until  draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe  is sent to the RFCeditor, but we could let it simply sit in the RFCeditor's queue pending the normative reference.",

This was the approach taken with  RFC5143  which was written in similar circumstances. In my original discuss I stated: \"Additionally we normally insist that this relative status is reflected in the title and abstract, again to avoid any ambiguity on the matter.\" I see that the abstract now reflects the status, but still not the title. As originally noted it is better to have this sequenced behind the recommended protocol because as an informational there is a danger that readers will say \"this informational seems to work and the ST RFC is not available so we might as well use this\" thereby perpetuation a design that the IETF is deprecating. By either publishing as Historic and/or sequencing publication the IETF's message to the reader not to deploy this is much clearer.",
