However, I believe this document shouldn't be published in the IETF stream, regardless of its status.\u00a0 I mainly considered the proposed applicability (for example, \"GTP-U protocol [TS.29281] is replaced by SRv6\") and the fact that it \"is not related to any current technical work\" in 3GPP [1]. I am then ABSTAINing and not standing in the way of publication. [1]  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/3gpp-ietf-coord/XV5GRtdJLLyqpuJr1unw03sf1-A/",

I always like the use of innovative technologies. Please find below two blocking DISCUSS points (easy to address), some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated even if only for my own education), and some nits. Special thanks to Sri Gundavelli for the shepherd's detailed write-up including the very descriptive WG consensus ***but*** the justification of the intended status is plain wrong as it is about the original intended status.  I hope that this review helps to improve the document, Regards, -\u00e9ric ## DISCUSS As noted in  https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/ , a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion on the following topics: ### Intended status  The shepherd's write-up is about a standard track intended status, but this document text & meta-data say informal. I know the sad history of the intended status as well as that the IETF Last Call was done a 2nd time for 'informational', but I am afraid that the shepherd's write-up must be updated. ### Section 2.2 What is \"gNB\" ? (I know the term, but a reference and definition should be given) Unsure how to parse the bullet list as `SRH[n]: A shorter ` appears in the middle of apparently a single list. Or is it two lists ? Then what is the relationship with the 2nd list ? (possibly just a formatting issue).",
