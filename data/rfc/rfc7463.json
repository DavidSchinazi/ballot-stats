        "text": "I generally agree with Barry's DISCUSS item regarding 2119 language. The following are a couple of examples from section 5.3 that I find particularly egregious: \u00a0  When calls are placed on hold, the \u00a0  \"+sip.rendering=no\" feature tag MUST be included in dialog package \u00a0  notifications. This MUST seems completely bogus. What if I want to have a feature called \"Hold but keep private\" so that someone can be put on hold, but nobody else knows that I'm not listening to what the person says? You're saying that I MUST NOT do that? I don't buy it as an interoperability requirement. \u00a0  In the following cases, before sending the INVITE, A UA MUST send a \u00a0  dialog package PUBLISH request and wait for a 2xx response before \u00a0  proceeding: \u00a0  [...] \u00a0  An exception is an emergency call, when a UA MUST never wait for a \u00a0  confirmed seizure before sending an INVITE.\u00a0 Instead, the emergency \u00a0  call MUST proceed without waiting for the PUBLISH transaction. The first MUST is really a SHOULD; there are circumstances (or at least one circumstance: the emergency call) in which you do not need to send the PUBLISH and wait. The other two MUSTs seem all about usability, not interoperability or damage to the network. That is, the MUSTs are not protocol requirements; they are user requirements. The last paragraph should be rewritten. \u00a0  An exception is an emergency call, where the UA will certainly want \u00a0  to send the INVITE immediately and not bother waiting for the \u00a0  PUBLISH transaction. It is more important for the emergency call to \u00a0  go through than to confirm the seizure. 2119 text there is wrong. \u00a0  Appearance numbers are a shorthand label for active and pending \u00a0  dialogs related to an AOR.\u00a0 Many of the features and services built \u00a0  using this extension rely on the correct rendering of this \u00a0  information to the human user.\u00a0 [...] The 2119 language in this paragraph is simply bogus. As the paragraph says, these are about \"correct rendering\" along with \"value and usefulness\". They are not about interoperability and not about limiting potential for harm. Describing the intended semantics is fine, but trying to dictate particular user interface elements is not. As 2119 says, \"they must not be used to try to impose a particular method on implementors where the method is not required for interoperability.\" Below in the COMMENTs are additional 2119 uses that might be a problem, but I've got some questions about them. They might end up as part of the DISCUSSion if there are not good reasons to use them.",

The MUSTs are wrong here. Instead: \"User Agents that support the Shared Appearance feature use the dialog state package...\" or even better: \"The Shared Appearance feature uses the dialog state package...\". There is no interoperability warning here; you're simply describing what the protocol does. Just as you don't ever say \"MUST support SIP\" (which would be silly), it is equally silly to say say that you \"MUST support the dialog package stuff\". If I could not sensibly choose to do otherwise, the MUST is not useful. \u00a0  When publishing or notifying dialog package information, a UA MUST \u00a0  include all dialog identification available at the time of \u00a0  publication, with the exception that a UA may omit information if it \u00a0  wishes to prevent other UAs from joining or picking up a call. Again, you're not saying something about timing (\"at the time of publication\") or other interoperability concern. You're saying, \"If you want to include dialog information, you MUST include dialog information.\" That's not a needed MUST. (Again, unless I'm missing something.)  \u00a0  If the call is an emergency call, a UA MUST never wait for a \u00a0  confirmed seizure before sending an INVITE.\u00a0 Instead, the emergency \u00a0  call MUST proceed without waiting for the PUBLISH transaction. \u00a0  Otherwise, in the following cases, before sending the INVITE, a UA \u00a0  MUST send a dialog package PUBLISH request and wait for a 2xx \u00a0  response before proceeding: I still don't really understand the MUST in the second paragraph. If you don't have to wait for the response to send the INVITE in the emergency case, what harm is there in not waiting in non-emergency cases?",
