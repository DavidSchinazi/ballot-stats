If  RFC4013  also prohibited zero length passwords (I couldn't tell at a quick glance) or if the WG did debate this and having done so decided to prohibit zero length passwords then I will clear the discuss immediately. But if not, I'd like to chat about it... There are situations where an empty password is ok (say when I'm not \"protecting\" something but just want to know what user's profile to use, e.g. for weather) and that is supported in many systems (that hence won't be able to exactly adopt this) and insisting on a non-empty password could be more damaging than allowing a zero-length password, whenever a user re-uses a password for something for which no password is really needed (and which hence is less likely to be well protected) and where that password is also used to protect something of significantly higher value. The zero-length password is also not an interesting subset of the set of stupid passwords really so doesn't deserve to be called out as such (and you say that in the draft when you talk about length-1 passwords.) So I think allowing zero length passwords is better overall, and more consistent with implementations.",
