If it's possible to tap the connection to generate traffic, couldn't it also be tapped for monitoring purposes?\u00a0 This would leave the possibility of active attacks (you've already described one) and passive attacks, which we see with pervasive monitoring.\u00a0 If this is possible, how about the following text to include this consideration (or some other variation is fine too if you'd like to propose something): \u00a0  The data traffic between CE and PE is not encrypted and it is\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0  possible that in an insecure environment, a malicious user may tap\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0  into the CE to PE connection and could conduct an active or passive \u00a0  attack.\u00a0 An example of an active attack would be generating traffic \u00a0  using the spoofed destination MAC address on the Ethernet \u00a0  Attachment Circuit and a passive attack could include targeted or \u00a0  pervasive monitoring [ RFC7258 ] between the CE and PE.
