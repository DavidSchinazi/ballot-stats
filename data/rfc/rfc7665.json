If this architecture is what ongoing standardization of SFC should be based on, then I think it should be on the Standards Track.\u00a0 There are already a number of drafts that intend to be on the standards track that are using this document as a normative reference [1], which makes sense based on the text above.\u00a0 Note that none of the drafts that use the document as a normative reference have been adopted by the WG, but the point is still the same: if the intent is for this document to be used as a base for future standardization, then I think it should belong in the standards track.\u00a0 I know that we can always add a downref exception, but why would that be necessary if this document is intended to be guide future standardization for SFC? OTOH, if the WG decided that this is just \u201can architecture\u201d (vs. *the* architecture), and that is why the intended status changed in -07, then it should be made clear in the text.
