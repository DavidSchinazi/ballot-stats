        "text": "Thank you for a well written document, it was a pleasure to read. I have a small list of issues that I would like to discuss before recommending approval of this document: In Section 5.3: \u00a0  If the zero touch information artifact contains redirect information, \u00a0  the device MUST, within limits of how many recursive loops the device \u00a0  allows, process the redirect information as described in Section 5.5. \u00a0  This is the recursion step, it will cause the device to reenter this \u00a0  algorithm, but this time the data source will definitely be a \u00a0  bootstrap server, as that is all redirect information is able to \u00a0  redirect a device to. I think you need to specify a \"max redirect\" value in order to prevent intentional or unintentional misconfigurations. Without such limit it is trivial to introduce denial-of-service attack on naive device implementations. 2)  10.3.\u00a0 The SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type Registry \u00a0  IANA is kindly requested to add two entries in the \"SMI Security for \u00a0  S/MIME CMS Content Type\" registry (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1), with \u00a0  values as follows: \u00a0  Decimal\u00a0 Description\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  References \u00a0  -------\u00a0 --------------------------------------\u00a0 ---------- \u00a0  TBD1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 id-ct-zerotouchInformationXML\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [RFCXXXX] \u00a0  TBD2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 id-ct-zerotouchInformationJSON\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  [RFCXXXX] \u00a0  id-ct-zerotouchInformationXML indicates that the \"zerotouch- \u00a0  information\" is encoded using XML.\u00a0 id-ct-zerotouchInformationJSON \u00a0  indicates that the \"zerotouch-information\" is encoded using JSON. You define these values, but they are not used anywhere in the document. It looks like you intended for this to be used in several places, for example: 3.1.\u00a0 Zero Touch Information \u00a0  When the zero touch information artifact is unsigned, as it might be \u00a0  when communicated over trusted channels, the CMS structure's top-most \u00a0  content type MUST be one of the OIDs described in Section 10.3, or \u00a0  the OID id-data (1.2.840.113549.1.7.1), in which case the encoding \u00a0  (JSON, XML, etc.)\u00a0 SHOULD be communicated externally.\u00a0 In either Did you intend to use the above OIDs here? \u00a0  case, the associated content is an octet string containing \u00a0  \"zerotouch-information\" data in the expected encoding.",
