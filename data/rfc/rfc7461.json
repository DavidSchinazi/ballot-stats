Is it time to update the MIB security considerations template to include privacy considerations and a mention of the importance of the protections for all environments including home and those that effect an individual?\u00a0 I think it would save us a lot of time and would be helpful.\u00a0 I think the security considerations are very good, but that adding a statement that the recommendations for secure authenticated access controls applies to home networks would be good.\u00a0 This additional text would also explain privacy considerations that Alissa proposed (in another discuss for  draft-ietf-eman-energy-monitoring-mib-12 ).\u00a0 I'd hate to see assumptions that a home device doesn't matter when developers/implementer reads the security considerations section for MIB drafts related to IoT.

The draft already calls out the read/write objects, which is great, so there is no need to call out specific attacks that could occur using these settings to an individual or home (IMO).\u00a0 When I went through the draft, I did try to think through possibilities for attacks, but will leave that out as to keep the discussion focused and see how we might improve the considerations.

In the first paragraph of the Security considerations template, a change to the sentence on implications of SET operations would also be helpful.\u00a0 It seems that all of the SecDir reviewers (& I) had fun thinking up scenarios that are becoming real that we would rather see avoided for the IoT related reviews. The following sentence in the current template doesn't cover the attack implications that are possible for IoT if some of the possible SET operations are attacked: \u00a0  \"The \u00a0  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper \u00a0  protection can have a negative effect on network operations.\"  We are moving to a world where the security of the environment can be effected, where a home or individual can be attacked in new ways (burst pipes in the winter through heating settings, muck with backup power to the refrigerator spoiling food during a power outage, set alarms on batteries to go off as an annoyance or to not go off at all to do real damage to home, building, etc.).\u00a0 Tero and Steve K. came up with a few 'fun' attacks as well. How about changing the above sentence to the following (or to something that gets at the same point): \u00a0  \"The \u00a0  support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper \u00a0  protection can have a negative effect on network operations or leave \u00a0  cyber physical devices used by individuals, homes, and business \u00a0  vulnerable to attack.\"  Steve Kent's SecDir review:  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg04897.html For the energy monitoring mib review:  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg04881.html Thanks!",
