The draft says \"When operating in secure mode...\", but it doesn't discuss when one might want to run in secure more vs non-secure mode. It would be helpful to discuss the actual threads. You mention TCP DoS attacks, but, for example, can an eavesdropper learn sensitive or private information? Is there a risk of someone impersonating a partner? Tampering with messages on the network? There's a mention of using TLS certs for authentication/authorization, but I think there's more to be said there. Is there any authentication or authorization if you aren't using secure mode? How do you match a TLS certificate to the partner name? The section opens saying that the security considerations from 3315 and 3633 apply, but I doubt either of those contemplated that you would be sending DHCP messages over TCP connections between partner servers.",
