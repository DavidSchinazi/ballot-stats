Notably, the detnet charter states: \"WG sustaining/informational documents may include: These documents may not necessarily be published, but may be maintained in a draft form or on a collaborative Working Group wiki to support the efforts of the Working Group and help new comers: Problem statement and (constrained) deployment environments User-driven use cases\" So I would not have expected this document to be published as an RFC. I also could not find any other WG documents referencing this normatively. There are a few places in the document that are particularly problematic for an archival document: 4.2.1 \"There are many field protocols used today; some are standards-based \u00a0  and others are proprietary (see standards [lontalk], [modbus], \u00a0  [profibus] and [flnet]).\" I would suggest s/today/at the time of this writing/ 5.1.2 \"Note: Current WG discussion indicates that some peer-to-peer \u00a0  communication must be assumed, i.e. the PCE may communicate only \u00a0  indirectly with any given device, enabling hierarchical configuration \u00a0  of the system.\" This seems like it could be rendered out of date. I would suggest deleting \"Current WG discussion indicates that.\" 12.4 \"Current WG consensus is that this item won't be \u00a0  directly supported by the DetNet architecture, for example because it \u00a0  implies guarantee of in-order delivery of packets which conflicts \u00a0  with the core goal of achieving the lowest possible latency.\" Same comment as above. I would suggest deleting \"Current WG consensus is that.\"",
