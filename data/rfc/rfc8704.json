Still looking at Figure 4, if the operator of ISP4 uses Algorithm A (because he/she thinks they may not be in a \"challenging scenario\"), then it opens the door to ISP2 changing its policy so that the uRPF check in ISP4 fails, as shown in Figure 4.\u00a0 IOW, an attacker in ISP2 could stop advertising reachability to some prefixes and cause ISP4 to fail the uRPF check and drop the traffic.\u00a0 The victim in this case could be AS1, whose traffic (through ISP2 to ISP4) was flowing fine and then it stopped. I am balloting DISCUSS because the guidance provided for the selection of an Algorithm is not clear enough to be certain that the selection is the correct one; and the election of Algorithm A creates a vulnerability (as explained in the text) that is not mentioned.",
