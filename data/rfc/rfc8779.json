        "text": "This document makes some well-needed extensions to existing PCEP concepts such as bandwidth, but I'm not convinced that the way they interact with existing PCEP functionality is sufficiently well specified to admit interoperable implementation.\u00a0 Specifically, we introduce the generalized bandwidth structures and reuse that encoding for the generalized load balancing structures, which includes a notion of \"minimum bandwidth specification\".\u00a0 But now that the bandwidth specification is a compound data structure instead of a scalar type, it's not guaranteed that we have a strict linear ordering with well-defined minimum.\u00a0 If we consider the specific case of Intserv, do I insist upon all three of the minimum bucket rate, minimum bucket size, and minimum peak data rate?\u00a0 Or perhaps I only care about the peak data rate and not the bucket size/rate.\u00a0 We need more text in order to specify what \"minimum\" actually means/measures. Similarly, I'm not sure all the referenced generalized bandwidth types/traffic parameters in Section 2.3 clearly indicate which structures/fields we are to incorporate by reference (see COMMENT). Section 2.1.2 says: \u00a0  GMPLS-CAPABILITY TLV it is RECOMMENDED that the PCC does not make use \u00a0  of the objects and TLVs defined in this document. Why is this not \"the PCC MUST NOT make use of the objects and TLVs defined in this document\"?\u00a0 Ignoring the peer's (non-)advertisement and plowing ahead seems like a recipe for non-interoperability. Section 2.5.1 notes that: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ::= \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  [ []]... \u00a0  For endpoint type Point-to-Multipoint, several endpoint objects MAY \u00a0  be present in the message and each represents a leave, exact meaning \u00a0  depend on the endpoint type defined of the object. If all s represent leaves, then how is the head node specified? I couldn't find a full spcification for some of the fields in the XRO Label subobject (Section 2.7) by chasing the indicated references (see COMMENT).",
