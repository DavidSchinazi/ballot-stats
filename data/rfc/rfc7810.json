        "text": "(1) There seems to be some inconsistency in the way the A-bit is described as applied to the min/max delay sub-TLV. Section 4.2 says: \"A-bit.\u00a0 The A-bit represents the Anomalous (A) bit.\u00a0 The A-bit is set \u00a0  when the measured value of this parameter exceeds its configured \u00a0  maximum threshold.\u00a0 The A bit is cleared when the measured value \u00a0  falls below its configured reuse threshold.\u00a0 If the A-bit is clear, \u00a0  the sub-TLV represents steady state link performance.\" Is the A-bit meant to apply only to the min delay? Or only to the max delay? Then Section 5 says: \"For sub-TLVs which include an A-bit (except min/max \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 delay), an additional threshold SHOULD be included \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 corresponding to the threshold for which the performance \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is considered anomalous (and sub-TLVs with the A-bit are \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 sent).\" Since min/max delay is excepted from this recommendation, I don't understand what the A-bit means in the min/max delay sub-TLV. (2) Section 11 says: \"This document does not introduce security issues beyond those \u00a0  discussed in [ RFC5305 ].\" This seems false. First,  RFC 5305  doesn't seem to discuss any security issues. It points to  RFC 5304 . But even compared to  RFC 5304 , it seems this document does introduce new issues, because it exposes real-time performance information about the network which may be commercially sensitive, and which  RFC 5305  does not expose. So, for example, the claim in  RFC 5304  that \"Because a routing protocol contains information that need not be kept secret, privacy is not a requirement,\" does not seem true. It may be that the same authentication mechanisms can be used, but that doesn't mean the threat model is the same. Happy to defer to others with more routing security clue than I, but it seems like at a minimum the potential value of the information contained in the new sub-TLVs to an attacker needs to be acknowledged.",
