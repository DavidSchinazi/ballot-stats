In line with it's title, I would like to see this document include rules about processing of multiple flags.\u00a0 I know that it is not possible to set out rules for the interaction of yet-to-be-defined flags, but at least adding text to the effect of \"documents defining additional flags MUST discuss how they interact with existing flags\" would go a long way. I am balloting DISCUSS because even though this document is not introducing new issues, the combination of what is defined in  rfc8231 /rfc8281/I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-control-request does...and a document titled \"Updated Rules for Processing Stateful PCE Request Parameters Flags\" is then the optimal place to address them. [Aside: If this DISCUSS is resolved as suggested above, then  I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-control-request , which is on the RFC EDitor's queue, will have to be updated.]",
