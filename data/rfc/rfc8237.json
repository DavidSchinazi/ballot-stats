        "text": "0) The intended scope of this protocol is not clearly specified in the Abstract or Introduction.\u00a0 By \u00a0 \u00a0 looking at  RFC 6478 , I can see that the original method (and hence the optimization) is for  \u00a0 \u00a0 static pseudo-wires.\u00a0  However, in the introduction, it says \" When PWs use a Multi Protocol  \u00a0  Label Switched (MPLS) network as the Packet Switched Network (PSN), they are setup according \u00a0  to [ RFC8077 ] static configuration mode and the PW status information is propagated \u00a0  using the method described in [ RFC6478 ].\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Looking at  RFC8077  - I see a single line about static \u00a0  assignment. \u00a0  From reading the abstract & introduction, I cannot tell whether this technology applies to: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  a) statically configured PWs across a dynamically controlled PSN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  b) statically configured PWs across an MPLS-TP network \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  c) any PWs across a dynamically controlled PSN \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  d)\u00a0 any PWs across an MPLS-TP network \u00a0 I'm sure that the authors and WG have a clearly understood scoping - but\u00a0 it isn't obvious, even \u00a0 after scanning references to me.\u00a0 I think that it is intended for \"statically configured PWs\" because \u00a0 if LDP were used to create the PWs, there would be information about the PW status in LDP so this \u00a0 mechanism (optimizing the mechanism that is in  RFC 6478 ) is only needed for statically configured PWs. 1) In Sec 2, it states \"A PE using the PW status refresh reduction protocol MUST send the PW \u00a0  status refresh reduction Message as soon as a PW is configured on a \u00a0  particular LSP. \"\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I have several questions as I think about implementing this and dig into the nuances.\u00a0 As it \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  is stated, I think it has issues. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  a) Is the assumption that a PE will use the PW status reduction protocol for every LSP it has? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wouldn't that depend on the egress of the LSP & specifics of configuration?\u00a0 This MUST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  removes such flexibility without any discussion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  b) Do you mean the PW status refresh reduction message MUST be sent as soon as the first PW \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  is configured on an LSP?\u00a0  If this is for every new PW without consideration for dampening, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I could see a new configuration being loaded, processed, and resulting in a flood of PW status \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  refresh reduction messages.\u00a0  Surely there should be a maximum rate at least. 2) In Sec 3: \"If the refresh reduction protocol session is terminated by entering \u00a0  the INACTIVE or STARTUP states, the PE MUST immediately re-send all \u00a0  the previously sent PW status messages for that particular LSP for \u00a0  which the session terminated. In this case the refresh timer value \u00a0  MUST NOT be set to zero, and MUST be set according to the local \u00a0  policy of the PE router.\" \u00a0  This MUST forces a flood of messages.\u00a0 Is there a reason that the PW status messages \u00a0  shouldn't be staggered out in time based upon 2x the refresh timer for PW status messages? \u00a0  At a minimum, something like \"the PE SHOULD re-send .... as soon as possible and MUST \u00a0  resent them within .... interval\" would be safer for the spiked load.",
