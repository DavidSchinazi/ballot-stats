This is a major technical change from -03, which, AFAIK, prohibited the server from negotiating these algorithms with TLS 1.1 and below and maintained the usual TLS version 1.2 negotiation rules. This is a very material technical change. I don't consider it wise, but in any case it would absolutely need WG consensus, which I don't believe that it has given the recent introduction. The discussion of dictionary attacks here seems inferior to that in 4279. In particular, you only need to actively attack one connection to capture the data you need for a brute force attack despite the text there referring to trying \"different keys\".
