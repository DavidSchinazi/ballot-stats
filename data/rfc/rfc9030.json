I don't have a deep enough understanding to make a final judgement of which draft would need to be listed as normative references, however, I wanted to raise this point on the discuss level in order to ensure that this is considered before publication. To give an example: Section 4.6.3 goes quite seep into details of what's described in [ I-D.ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery ]. However as long as [ I-D.ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery ] is not published yet, the 6tisch arch should probably not rely on the content of this draft that strongly. Putting [ I-D.ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery ] as a normative reference ensures that this draft will not be published before [ I-D.ietf-6lo-fragment-recovery ].",
