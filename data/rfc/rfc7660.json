        "text": "No general objection to the publication of the document. However, I am relaying a question from David Black as a DISCUSS point.  I assume that the draft is more than unclear in Section 3.2\u00a0 about what traffic means. Is it a particular flow, a single packet, etc? \"I found an ECN concern, and hence added the TSV ADs to the CC line. Section 3.2 says: \u00a0  The Congestion-Treatment AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped and \u00a0  indicates how congested traffic, i.e., traffic that has Explicit \u00a0  Congestion Notification Congestion Experienced marking set or some \u00a0  other administratively defined criteria, is treated.\u00a0  That appears to say that the congestion treatment may be applied solely to packets that have the CE (Congestion Experienced) marking. That would be a problem, because the defined semantics of a CE marking is that it applies to the entire flow (e.g., causes TCP to react as if a packet has been dropped), hence the congestion treatment ought to apply to the entire flow. In other words, one wants to be able to use the ECN-IP-Codepoint AVP as part of the condition that determines whether the filter rule matches, but ignore that AVP (i.e., wildcard it) in determining what traffic the action applies to, so that the response to detecting a congested flow (i.e., packets with ECN field containing CE) applies to all packets in the flow, regardless of the value in the CE field. Otherwise, the result may be ineffective, as it won't encompass packets in the congested flow that aren't CE-marked. Am I reading the draft correctly?\"",
