The recursive resolver \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 remembers what opportunistic encrypted transport protocols have \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 worked recently based on a (clientIP, serverIP, protocol) tuple. This makes little sense to me. If the passive attackers sees the outgoing port 53 cleartext query, it doesn't even matter if DoT or DoQ is then established in parallel. The privacy is already lost. I strongly believe that DoT/DoQ should be tried first without unencrypted DNS, and only when that doesn't work in a very short time (eg 3s? 5s?) send out the unencrypted query. ### DNS cache handling It does say anything about what it expects should happen with the cached DNS data through a restart. Note that dropping the cache and restarting, especially on mobile devices, will lead to easy fingerprinting for passive attackets in recognising users when their browser tabs reload (eg if queries to apollo.ns.cloudflare and katelyn.ns.cloudflare.com . happen, even when encrypted, it could be a sign of the mobile device trying to reach the ACLU. If that same IP is trying to reach  ken.ns.cloudflare.com . or  jill.ns.cloudflare.com , it could be that  ietf.org  is being looked up. The two of these combined would most likely mean the device on or behind this IP address is dkg) While I understand that DNS cache handling over restarts is kind of out of scope for this document, if this document is being read as \"how to run a DNS resolver with maximum privacy on your mobile device\" then without this advise, the whole unilateral probing gives us nothing. (note: in Fedora I had this exact issue, where some people insisted on purging DNS cache on interface change, and I insisted on keeping DNS cache, so the NetworkManager got an option to tweak this behaviour). DNS cache handling for DNS resolvers on non-mobile devices, eg those on static IPs shared by many independent clients, might not need to consider this. ### Section 4.6.2 Pseudocode Either I don't understand the pseudo code, or it is wrong: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Otherwise: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * Remove Q from Do53-queries[X] \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If R is successful: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * If Q is in Do53-queries[X]: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [...] Since Q was just removed from Do53-queries, isn't this condition now always false ? Also, what is \"R is successful\" ? because that seems to happen before \"R is further processed\".\u00a0 Wouldn't processing be needed to determine if R is successful? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But if R is unsuccessful (e.g. timeout or connection closed): But the whole state starts with: \"When a response R for query Q arrives\" ??? ### Section 4 / Section 7 : Security advise Should it not clearly state the resolver MUST enable query minimalization? Otherwise, sending queries to the root would leak all privacy even if the TLD supports DoT/DoQ. Or the same one level lower if the TLD doesn't support this yet. Possibly it should RECOMMEND (or even REQUIRE) using  RFC 8806  to prevent leaking root queries. (I noticed later this was mentioned in the Security Considerations, but  I think it would be good to promote those into Section 4 as SHOULDs) ### Zone owner recommendations ? Should zone owners get a recommendation for using out-domain nameservers to reduce leaking at the root and TLD? Eg if  nohats.ca  uses  ns1.example.com and  ns1.example.com  supports DoT/DoQ, but the root and .com do not, then queries for  nohats.ca  are not leaked to the root or .com. While when using in-domain nameservers, the target domain is leaked.",

I do not see any use of this draft. In its regular use, the user is still sending their queries in the clear initially. The draft assumes that after the initial leak, queries for the same target will be encrypted opportunistically. I tried pointing out that on most mobile devices, this is not the case due to frequent network changes and DNS cache purges. Any Operational or Security Considerations related to this were deemed out of scope. I can only conclude that no privacy is gained, and that the additional complexity in code is not worth the effort of implementing. Additionally, since the draft requires the DNS servers to generate a certificate, the difference between generating a self-signed certificate, and using an ACME based certificate that CAN be validated and wouldn't need unilateral opportunistic security, I see even less reasons to attempt to deploy this. As no indications are given back to the user, the draft does the enduser no harm (other than possibly introducing bugs due to added complexity on the code) and I see no reason to further block it with a DISCUSS.",
