I'd like to see improvements from the SecDir review, still in discussion: http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg04910.html 1. On Ben's first point, could a reference be provided since this draft is discussing stuff that exists (security considerations are included in...) >> Indeed, this RFC discusses many things that have quite serious >> security considerations, without mentioning any of them. For example, >> section 4 \"How Do I Find My PCE?\" (the very first question) advocates >> a number of potentially completely insecure mechanisms with no mention >> of their security properties (or otherwise). This is obviously >> pervasive, given the stance taken in the security considerations. 2. For Ben's second question, Adrian provided a list of references, are they already planned to be included in the next update? From Adrian:  > Previous PCE RFCs have given some attention to security concerns in the use of PCE ( RFC 4655 ), PCE discovery ( RFC 4674 ,  RFC 5088 .  RFC 5089 ), and the PCEP ( RFC 4657  and  RFC 5440 ). As such, \"PCE Security\" was not deemed by the authors to be a previously \"unanswered question\" and so did not need attention in this document. From the rest of the discussion, I'd be happy to see the issues called out with references on where to find more information.\u00a0 This strikes a balance and ensures the security considerations are made known to the user and provides the pointer of where to look.\u00a0 I agree that we don't need to bloat the draft, but do agree that the issues should be made known.
