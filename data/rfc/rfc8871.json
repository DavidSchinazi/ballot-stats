However, there are some one issues we do need to discuss if they should be better handled before this document is ready for publication.  A significant security vunerability in PERC that should be made more explicit and is totally missing is the risks with compromised endpoints. Beyond the very evident thing that this endpoint can decrypt all media it receives there are far more sinister risk here. Namely the potential for injection of media that attempts to impersonate another endpoints media stream. Most of SRTP's cipher suits only use symmetric crypto functions, thus enabling anyone with the key to send a packet with any SSRC, and have that being accepted as that source. Where it is has no practical usage in point to point communication, in conferencing it becomes an issue. It allows the usage of media level replay or deep fakes to be used to create media streams that are injected into the media distributors using an SSRC of another endpoint.  The mitiagations that are missing from this document. The fact that a media distributor that is not compromised or collaborating with the compromised endpoint could actually prevent such media injection by applying source filtering of SSRCs and drop all that aren't associated with the endpoint. The other potential mitigation is to introduce another cipher suit that uses a non symmetric integrity protection mechanism, such as TESLA to prevent this type of injection.",
