        "text": "Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this document over the many years of its development. The document currently appears to contain normative statements that, while not literally contradictory, certainly point implementors in conflicting directions. \u00a75.1.1.1 says: >\u00a0 o\u00a0 Host candidates corresponding to IPv6 link-local addresses MUST >\u00a0 \u00a0  NOT be gathered. Further down, \u00a76.1.2.2 says: >\u00a0 To keep the amount of resulting candidate pairs >\u00a0 reasonable and to avoid candidate pairs that are highly unlikely to >\u00a0 work, IPv6 link-local addresses [ RFC4291 ] MUST NOT be paired with >\u00a0 other than link-local addresses. This second passage is nonsensical if IPv6 link local addresses MUST NOT be gathered. Please remove or amend one of these normative statements. If the first statement is retained, please add rationale. (As an aside, it makes more sense to cite 4291 the first time you mention IPv6 link local address rather than the second)",
