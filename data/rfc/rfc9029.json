But the guidance to experts in this draft seems to closely match \"IETF Review\" (sec 4.8 of 8126) except that it allows documents to get an allocation at an earlier stage in the process. The shepherd comment that \"RFC Required\" was an alternative proposal also indicates that the intent to become more, not less, strict. Indeed, the main change appears to be eliminating allocations to non-IETF-stream documents. So why not simply change the registry to \"IETF Review\" and allow provisional allocations? It would be much easier to use established mechanisms and standard definitions than rewriting them in this document. Is the SHOULD in Sec 2.1 carrying a lot of weight here?",
