An example for a well-managed and monitored environment is a data center network.  The reason for this is that there now back off mechanisms defined to loss.  2) It is not clear to me how this extension is reacting to all kinds of packet loss. Right now, it assumes sporadic losses that require a retransmission of a single or a few packets. However, more heavily losses that require an action from the data sender are not covered. Such a heavily loss could be due to congestion on the network path between both TFTP peers.  In short, it doesn't make sense to keep sending large windows, if the network path is congested. My proposal is to half the window-size on losses and potentially, depending on the desired compelixty, to allow an increase of the window size if there is no loss experienced anymore.  3) What is the error handling for this (Section 3, last paragraph): \"\u00a0 The rules for determining the final packet are unchanged from \u00a0  [ RFC1350 ] and [ RFC2348 ]. \u00a0  The reception of a data window with a number of blocks less than the \u00a0  negotiated windowsize is the final window.

        "text": "Thank you, Patrick and Joel, for our pre-ballot conversation. It was helpful, and short-circuited a number of points that didn't need to be part of a DIscuss. And for the record, I\u2019m sympathetic to a desire to decrease boot times in the 21st century, and something like this proposal seems a reasonable way to satisfy that desire. My original Discuss would have overlapped Martin\u2019s significantly, so I\u2019m downsizing to a couple of points that I\u2019d like to talk about, to avoid duplication. First (as my Discuss point) - as Joel has stated in various emails, this document does contain a significant number of \u201chealth warnings\u201d about where TFTP is appropriate to use, but they are tilted toward (very real) security concerns. I\u2019d suggest text that also points to concerns about congestion behavior. Perhaps something like this, in Section 4: \u201cThe windowsize extension is intended for use in managed networks, where any instances of sustained congestion loss will be noticed and corrected. The choice of an appropriate windowsize value depends on the underlying networking technology and topology, and likely other factors as well. This document does not make recommendations for a specific value, and it allows the operator considerable flexibility, with a maximum windowsize of 65535 blocks. Operators are encouraged to test various values, as shown in Section 5. Operators are encouraged to be conservative when selecting a windowsize, because as the table and chart in Section 5 shows, the benefit of continuing to increase the windowsize is subject to diminishing returns. Operators are encouraged to consider the possibility of events such as power-on/avalanche restarts, when a large number of clients may issue Read Requests to reboot within a small interval of time.\u201d I think I'm capturing points that we've chatted about in e-mail already, But please rephrase as appropriate.",
