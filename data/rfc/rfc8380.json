The document (including the security considerations) is written assuming that the TRILL-ENs can be trusted (and are not compromised), and that the directory information is accurate.\u00a0 However, I believe there are several cases that have been overlooked. (1) There aren't any basic safeguards specified to at least make sure that a TRILL-EN is doing the right thing (or something sensible).\u00a0 For example, what if the Ingress RBridge Nickname field in the TRILL header doesn't correspond to the first rBridge at the domain boundary?\u00a0 Should that frame be accepted? (2)  rfc8171  talks about issues with incorrect directory mappings.\u00a0 Consider the case where a TRILL-EN uses (on purpose!) an incorrect mapping.\u00a0 That \"can result in data being delivered to the wrong end stations, or set of end stations in the case of multi-destination packets, violating security policy.\" [ rfc8171 ]\u00a0 How can this risk be mitigated? I don't think that there are easy mitigations for these issues, but at least mentioning them so that operators are aware of the risk would be enough to clear this DISCUSS.",
