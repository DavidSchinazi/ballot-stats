(See COMMENT for more quibbles with \u00a75.1.) I think Appendix E is also using the wrong \"kty\" for X25519 (but is properly using \"X25519\" as the \"crv\"). I'd also like to discuss our treatment of channel binding, as the current mention seems dangerously incomplete.\u00a0 I don't remember if there is generic discussion of channel binding in the core EAP RFCs (if so, a specific reference would help), but otherwise if we're going to mention that protocol elements can be used for channel binding we should give some indication of how to actually do so in a secure manner (e.g., what protocol element needs to be verified against external channel information and what to do if they don't match).",

FP: IANA is requested to create a sub registry to the EAP registry, but there is no actual \"Nimble out-of-band authentication for EAP Parameters\" registry defined, nor values registered in it. Either this is a new page or (I would suggest) the subregistries are just created directly under the EAP page. 2. ----- Section 5.1 and following FP: This document defines several new registry with policy Specification required, which will need designated experts.  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-5.3  states that: \u00a0  When a designated expert is used, the documentation should give clear \u00a0  guidance to the designated expert, laying out criteria for performing \u00a0  an evaluation and reasons for rejecting a request.\u00a0 In the case where I believe designated expert guidance should be added to this document.",
