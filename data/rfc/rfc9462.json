        "text": "# SEC AD comments for { draft-ietf-add-ddr-08 } CC @paulwouters ## Discuss See my discuss on  draft-ietf-add-ddr-11  for my generic ADD DNR/DDR concerns ### \u00a0  Clients MUST NOT automatically use a Designated \u00a0  Resolver without some sort of validation Why not? What is the alternative? Using unencrypted DNS to the party that told you how and where to contact these (unvalidated) Designated Resolvers. ### \u00a0  However, if a given Unencrypted Resolver designates a Designated \u00a0  Resolver that does not use a private or local IP address and can be \u00a0  verified using the mechanism described in Section 4.2, it MAY be used \u00a0  on different network connections so long as the subsequent \u00a0  connections over other networks can also be successfully verified \u00a0  using the mechanism described in Section 4.2. This seems to go against a lot of advise in the documents that networks must be treated independently. Also, the network _wants_ you to use their designated resolver, so to say it is okay to use a totally different Designated Resolvers seems to violate the whole DNR/DDR architecture. This will also cause failure if there is split-DNS or internal-only data. Also, using \"public IP\" is not a good trustworthy method to prove that these IPs are truly the same Designated Resolver used by both networks. I can easily use an internal only zone with  dns.nohats.ca . IN A 8.8.8.8 and get a valid ACME'd certificate with SAN= dns.nohats.ca . The user connecting to another network might now be switching from my private DNS on my stolen 8.8.8.8 IP to the real google DNS. ### \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.\u00a0 The client MUST verify that the certificate contains the IP \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  address of the designating Unencrypted Resolver in a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  subjectAltName extension. How feasible is it to get a certificate with SAN=ip from one of the generally accepted root store CA's? Can you give me one example where I can get a certificate for  nssec.nohats.ca  with SAN=193.110.157.123 ?\u00a0 I do not think this is currently possible or easy. If I am right, that means all of Section 4.2 is wishful thinking and not realistic to get rolled out. (I know we can see the cert for 1.1.1.1, so it is possible, but I know of no ACME supported CA that issues these) ### \u00a0  If these checks fail, the client MUST NOT automatically use the \u00a0  discovered Designated Resolver. This creates a strange policy when compared to DNR where if you get a DHCP or RA for the Designated Resolver, which is also not validatable, that you do end up using it? And section 6.5 states DNR trumps DDR. ### \u00a0  If the Designated Resolver and the Unencrypted Resolver share an IP \u00a0  address, clients MAY choose to opportunistically use the Designated \u00a0  Resolver even without this certificate check (Section 4.3). Why only when the IP is the same? Why not for when the IP is different? What's to lose, since the only fallback option is stick to using the unencrypted resolver? ### \u00a0  If resolving the name of a Designated Resolver from an SVCB record \u00a0  yields an IP address that was not presented in the Additional Answers \u00a0  section or ipv4hint or ipv6hint fields of the original SVCB query, \u00a0  the connection made to that IP address MUST pass the same TLS \u00a0  certificate checks before being allowed to replace a previously known \u00a0  and validated IP address for the same Designated Resolver name. How does the appearance of an (unsigned) Additional Answer entry convey any kind of real world trust/authentication? In other words, why should it not ALWAYS pass the same TLS certificate checks ? ### Opportunistic Discovery has the same \"same IP\" issue. As the alternative is to use unencrypted DNS, why not just use it anyway? ### \u00a0  A DNS client that already knows the name of an Encrypted Resolver can \u00a0  use DDR to discover details about all supported encrypted DNS \u00a0  protocols. It's a little odd to mention this as the DNR draft really tries hard to say to only use the network's offered encrypted DNS servers, so this option is in conflict with the DNR draft. ### \u00a0  A DNS forwarder SHOULD NOT forward queries for \" resolver.arpa \" upstream. Unfortunately, all currently deployed software does not know this, so it will be very common that this happens. ## \u00a0  DNS resolvers that support DDR by responding to queries for \u00a0  _dns.resolver.arpa SHOULD treat  resolver.arpa  as a locally served \u00a0  zone per [ RFC6303 ] Why is this not a MUST ? ### \u00a0  To limit the impact of discovery \u00a0  queries being dropped either maliciously or unintentionally, clients \u00a0  can re-send their SVCB queries periodically. I don't see how this would improve security for the client. It also mixes up behaviour of proper DNS clients that have their own retransmit logic for if they get no answer. ### \u00a0  Section 8.2 of [ I-D.ietf-add-svcb-dns ] describes a second downgrade \u00a0  attack where an attacker can block connections to the encrypted DNS \u00a0  server, and recommends that clients prevent it by switching to SVCB- \u00a0  reliant behavior once SVCB resolution does succeed.\u00a0 For DDR, this \u00a0  means that once a client discovers a compatible Designated Resolver, \u00a0  it SHOULD NOT use unencrypted DNS until the SVCB record expires I wonder which attacker can block encrypted DNS connections but not spoof (or block!) an unsigned SVCB record to the local client? And even if that is the case, this would be a denial of service attack if the DNS client cannot fallback to unencrypted DNS. Spoofing an SVCB to a bogus IP with an SVCB TTL of a few hours would be a very cheap 1 packet attack to keep the DNS client down for hours. This seems dangerous to implement. ### \u00a0  DoH resolvers that allow discovery using DNS SVCB answers over \u00a0  unencrypted DNS MUST NOT provide differentiated behavior based on the \u00a0  HTTP path alone, since an attacker could modify the \"dohpath\" \u00a0  parameter.\u00a0 For example, if a DoH resolver provides provides a \u00a0  filtering service for one URI path, and a non-filtered service for \u00a0  another URI path, [...] It seems likely that this advise will get ignored a lot, eg by people who have limited public IPs to use to spin up a DoH server, or who have to pay-per-IP. This advise seems more appropriate for local private IP DoH servers. So I would change this MUST NOT to SHOULD NOT for that reason. ### \u00a0  If the IP address of a Designated Resolver differs from that of an \u00a0  Unencrypted Resolver, clients applying Verified Discovery \u00a0  (Section 4.2) MUST validate that the IP address of the Unencrypted \u00a0  Resolver is covered by the SubjectAlternativeName of the Designated \u00a0  Resolver's TLS certificate. How would one obtain such a certificate via ACME? Since on the IP of the unencrypted resolver, there would be no HTTP server running? Additionally, if the client notices a failed verification of the Designated Resolver's TLS certificate, wouldn't it fallback to the Unencrypted Resolver? But now it may not? So this becomes a denial of service then ? ### \u00a0  Clients using Opportunistic Discovery (Section 4.3) MUST be limited \u00a0  to cases where the Unencrypted Resolver and Designated Resolver have \u00a0  the same IP address. Based on earlier text, this should read \"the same non-public IP address\". ### I kind of miss the mode of where there is no indication of DDR or DNR, and you use \"unilateral probing\" ( draft-ietf-dprive-unilateral-probing ) to just connect to the DoT or DoQ ports of the Unencrypted Resolver and see if you get anything back. It might be unauthenticated TLS but better than port 53? ### \u00a0  This document calls for the addition of \" resolver.arpa \" to the \u00a0  Special-Use Domain Names (SUDN) registry established by [ RFC6761 ]. Why not pick resolver.local? As .local is already handled to not be forwarded by DNS forwarders. It would also not require an addition to SUDN. Even if someone was already using resolver.local, it would not interfere with that usage because that usage would not be using SVCB records. ## Comments ### section 3 \u00a0  To avoid name lookup deadlock, Designated Resolvers SHOULD follow the \u00a0  guidance in Section 10 of [ RFC8484 ] regarding the avoidance of DNS- \u00a0  based references that block the completion of the TLS handshake. I find that reference to list more the issues than solutions that can be followed. The solution to use another DoH server is not really appropriate in most cases The client's other interface likely resides on other networks where its private DoH server cannot resolve the name of another network's private DoH server. It is also not easy to get an IP based certificate (eg SAN=ip) that is accepted by general webpki root stores. And things like OCSP stapling doesn't help if the target is malicious - they just would omit the stapling that proves against its malicious use. The only real advise usable from  RFC8484  is \"use the local unencrypted resolver to resolve the encrypted resolver\". Might as well say that and remove the 8484 reference. ### I would argue that  I-D.ietf-add-dnr  is not an informative but normative reference, as the protocol is mentioned throughout the document as interacting with this protocol. ### \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clients that support SVCB will generally send out three queries \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 when accessing web content on a dual-stack network: A, AAAA, and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 HTTPS queries.\u00a0 Discovering a Designated Resolver as part of one \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of these queries, without having to add yet another query, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 minimizes the total number of queries clients send. I don't understand this paragraph. Once clients can send SVCB queries for web content, they already have had to do all the DDR/DNR related queries, so I don't understand the argument of \"saving queries\" ? Also, it is adding queries for a specific target, eg  resolver.arpa , and this cannot be \"saved\" either? What am I misunderstanding here? ### NITS provides provides -> provides",

Hopefully, a BoF/WG in the future will attempt to address this security problem. ## unresolved DISCUSS items Below follows my specific old DISCUSS items that were not addressed. ### \u00a0  Clients MUST NOT automatically use a Designated \u00a0  Resolver without some sort of validation Why not?
