(2) 'The path computation effects of the P bit are described in the \"P\" item in section 5.2 and section 5.5.\u00a0 But the descriptions are unclear, or perhaps they presume that there are only two LSPs in the group.\u00a0 I think the intended meaning is that all of the LSPs in the group with P=1 are computed first, and then with those LSPs fixed, the LSPs in the group with P=0 are computed.\u00a0 This will cause shortest-path constraints (and other objective functions) to be optimized on the P=1 LSPs, and those paths will not be de-optimized by competition from the other paths.\u00a0 This should probably be pulled out of the description of the \"P\" in its TLV and put into a separate paragraph.'",
