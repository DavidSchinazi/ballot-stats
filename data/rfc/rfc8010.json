I think these should be reasonably easy to resolve: - 8.1.1: The first paragraph requires support for MD5 and MD5-sess, and has no discussion of other algorithms.\u00a0 But the reference has been updated to  RFC 7616 , which is not quite compatible with that guidance. 7616 deprecates MD5, but allows it for backwards compatibility. It also makes SHA2-256 MTI. I realize there may be backwards compatibility issues, but I think the text should at least discuss the issue and encourage people to move away from md5. -9 If I read this section correctly, it requires (at SHOULD level) IPP/1.1 implementations to understand and correctly respond to IPP/2.X messages. How is this different from saying they SHOULD implement 2.X, but be backwards compatible with 1.1? ( I think this also applies to 2911bis).",

Sections 8.1.1 & 8.1.2: Preference: Could the text be re-written to have TLS as a MUST unless restrictions of the device make it so it is not possible or feasible?\u00a0 Not having TLS for authentication at least is a really bad idea.\u00a0 If it is just a SHOULD, when it is possible, developers may opt to not use TLS when there is no reason.\u00a0  If TLS stays as a SHOULD, I'd like to see stronger language around why it is recommended for use as the security considerations section only really talks about why it is not a MUST.\u00a0 It would be good to have sufficient motivation for developers and implementers to do the right thing.",
