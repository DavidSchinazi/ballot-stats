After some analysis ... When comparing the imports lines from  RFC4008  and the ones from this draft, those 4 lines magically appeared in this draft. Why? This asks the question: have you actually started your work from the MIB module extracted from  RFC4008 ? I started to file a DISCUSS on that very point. However, I was so bothered by this difference that I actually compared the MIB modules extracted from this draft and from  RFC4008 . I see two occurences of this change: InetAddress (SIZE (4|16) versus InetAddress Why? Also, I wanted to check this condition in  RFC4181 : \u00a0  - On the other hand, the module name MUST NOT be changed (except to \u00a0 \u00a0  correct typographical errors), existing definitions (even obsolete \u00a0 \u00a0  ones) MUST NOT be removed from the MIB module, and descriptors and \u00a0 \u00a0  OBJECT IDENTIFIER values associated with existing definitions MUST \u00a0 \u00a0  NOT be changed or re-assigned.

See the discussion captured on the MIB-doctors list.  - Let me check something. As noted by Jouni\u00a0 in his OPS-DIR review, \u00a0 \u00a0 The smilint reports the following warnings: \u00a0 \u00a0 * mibs/NAT-MIB:15: [5] {import-unused} warning: identifier `DisplayString' imported from module `SNMPv2-TC' is never used \u00a0 \u00a0 * mibs/NAT-MIB:27: [5] {import-unused} warning: identifier `InterfaceIndex' imported from module `IF-MIB' is never used \u00a0 \u00a0 * mibs/NAT-MIB:33: [5] {import-unused} warning: identifier `InetAddressPrefixLength' imported from module `INET-ADDRESS-MIB' is never used \u00a0 \u00a0 * mibs/NAT-MIB:36: [5] {import-unused} warning: identifier `VPNIdOrZero' imported from module `VPN-TC-STD-MIB' is never used  My first reaction: it's normal because some objects are now deprecated (so not used any longer). After some analysis ... When comparing the imports lines from  RFC4008  and the ones from this draft, those 4 lines magically appeared in this draft. Why? This asks the question: have you actually started your work from the MIB module extracted from  RFC4008 ? I started to file a DISCUSS on that very point. However, I was so bothered by this difference that I actually compared the MIB modules extracted from this draft and from  RFC4008 . I see two occurences of this change: InetAddress (SIZE (4|16) versus InetAddress Why? Also, I wanted to check this condition in  RFC4181 : \u00a0  - On the other hand, the module name MUST NOT be changed (except to \u00a0 \u00a0  correct typographical errors), existing definitions (even obsolete \u00a0 \u00a0  ones) MUST NOT be removed from the MIB module, and descriptors and \u00a0 \u00a0  OBJECT IDENTIFIER values associated with existing definitions MUST \u00a0 \u00a0  NOT be changed or re-assigned. A word expressing that all  RFC 4008  MIB objects are included in this version, but with only the STATUS changed to deprecated would be helpful.",

Inserting a few lines that there are not implementations (as mentioned by Dave H.) would be sufficient. Dave's messages copied here for your convenience: The NAT-MIB was designed largely to be a NAT configuration MIB, back when it was hoped the security features of snmpv3 would make configuration using snmp more tenable. In reality, the complexity of snmpv3 security, and the continuation of snmp being listed as a top-ten vulnerability, discouraged people from moving to it quickly, and the other difficulties of snmp led to Netconf being started, and SNMP being identified a reasonable choice for monitoring, but not configuration. So the nat-mib was overtaken by events related to IETF management protocols. RFC4008  was treated as an individual submission after the NAT WG closed, and it was reviewed by the MIDCOM WG. The IESG questioned whether NAT-MIB should be an IETF standard, because the official IETF stance at the time of IESG review\u00a0 was \"NATs are bad; use IPv6\". See comments for  RFC4008 .  So  RFC4008  never had strong support from the IETF community. Other technologies for working with NATs, such as STUN and TURN and ICE, were already gaining traction by the time the nat-mib was approved. I think Jon Peterson was one of the transport ADs at the time, and working for a service provider that used NATs.  I recall him saying when the mib module was approved that he was glad the MIB work was finally completed so the community could focus on USEFUL approaches to nats and stop dealing with the NAT-MIB module. So the NAT-MIB was overtaken by NAT-related events even before its approval. NATs have had so many varieties, the behave WG was created to try to get all the various NAT approaches to work together better. The configuration approach of the nat-mib only addressed a subset of available NATs. So the nat-mib never got much implementation support, and the behave WG checked and found few implementations.",
