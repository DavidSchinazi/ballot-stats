        "text": "Hi There, Firstly thanks for the document.\u00a0 I have two issues I'd like to discuss and see if we can find some clarity on. The first stems from  RFC8200  Section 4.8 Third Paragraph, which reads: New hop-by-hop options are not recommended because nodes may be \u00a0  configured to ignore the Hop-by-Hop Options header, drop packets \u00a0  containing a Hop-by-Hop Options header, or assign packets containing \u00a0  a Hop-by-Hop Options header to a slow processing path.\u00a0 Designers \u00a0  considering defining new hop-by-hop options need to be aware of this \u00a0  likely behavior.\u00a0 There has to be a very clear justification why any \u00a0  new hop-by-hop option is needed before it is standardized. I believe that the document potentially needs to spell out a clearer justification to meet the requirements laid out in the above text. The second question relates to dealing with IOAM in the context of SRv6.\u00a0 With the HbH option - this is processed on a hop-by-hop basis and, as per  RFC8200 , is placed directly after the IPv6 header.\u00a0 This I don't see as a problem.\u00a0 My question comes in the case of the destination option.\u00a0 In SRv6, where a SID is, for all intents and purposes, acting like an address - I'd like to see some text dealing with what happens when the DO is applied in the context of the SRv6 where the destination address is not a normal address - but rather an IPv6 SID.\u00a0  Does the router drop the entire packet?\u00a0 Does the router \"de-encap\" as if it were a tunneled packet? Basically - I see a situation where that could lead to undefined behavior that always makes me nervous.  Could the authors, therefore, expand slightly on how the destination option is handled in the context of SRv6 and its various flavors?",

I'm so sorry to have to raise another one, related to the new text.  \u00a0  C1\u00a0 IOAM MUST be deployed as a limited domain feature as defined in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 [ RFC8799 ]. I applaud your desire to be prescriptive and concise. Unfortunately, I think there are a few problems here. First the small ones: you have  RFC 8799  as an Informative reference, which is problematic since you want to make adherence to it mandatory. But, if you move it to be a Normative reference (as seems indicated), then we encounter two further issues: first and less importantly, it\u2019s not an IETF document, so possibly needs to be treated as a downref?  But most importantly, as far as I can tell  RFC 8799  does not define \u201ca limited domain feature\u201d. It provides a taxonomy for talking about limited domains and various considerations, but nothing I would call a \u201cdefinition\u201d. I confess I\u2019ve only briefly reviewed 8799 just now, not fully re-read it, so maybe you will be able to point me to a clear and actionable definition, that an implementor of your spec could apply in order to comply with C1. If so, please do let me know what that definition is, and also update your reference to cite it specifically, rather than just the RFC number. In my own review of 8799, the closest I see is Section 6, \"Functional Requirements of Limited Domains\u201d. I will be a little surprised if you really want to require adherence requirements 1-11 in that section, though. Sadly, I suspect that you\u2019ll end up concluding that  RFC 8799  isn\u2019t fit for the purpose you\u2019re trying to use it for and that you\u2019ll need to write out in your own words what the specific requirements are for your case. It looks to me as though the taxonomy section of  RFC 8799  might be quite useful to you in that respect, indeed that seems to be partly what it\u2019s for: ``` A.9. Making Use of This Taxonomy This taxonomy could be used to design or analyze a specific type of limited domain. ``` It\u2019s unfortunate that we don\u2019t have a good, citable definition of \u201climited domain\u201d in our document set... but we don\u2019t. This might be merely because nobody has bothered to write it yet, although I think the real reason is more likely that it turns out to be a sticky problem to nail it down to a definition that is both general enough to be broadly applicable and specific enough to be actionable.",

        "text": "I spent a while oscillating between DISCUSS and NoObjection when balloting on this document, before finally settling on Abstain (a non-blocking position). Like others, I have concerns about what happens when IOAM EH packets invariably leak outside the IOAM domain. My views align very strongly with John Scudder's, but seeing as he is already carrying the DISCUSS, I'm going to cowardly abstain and hide behind him. The document feels like it is creating something very similar to a \"limited domain\"; the reason that I'm not balloting DISCUSS is that the document \"feels\" like it is trying to minimize the damage when IOAM packets do leak. This includes \"failing closed\" ('IOAM MUST be explicitly enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM domain'). I am, however, quite troubled by the \"As additional security, IOAM domains MUST provide a mechanism to prevent unauthorized injections at ingress or leaks at egress.\" without actually stating how this would be performed. The fact that the IOAM data is information (it doesn't obfuscate the source of the traffic, nor (hopefully!) change routing / forwarding) also helps push this from DISCUSS to Abstain for me - when a domain *does* leak packets with IOAM info, they will either exceed the MTU and so be dropped, or will \"just\" be leaking traffic stats from that domain, and should otherwise be forwarded OK. There are some Considerations in Sec 5 which I think are unrealistic, but not harmful - for example: * I suspect that in some cases adding IOAM will change ECMP hashing (C1); * they *will* leak (C3), but this shouldn't break things;  * they *will* leak (C4), but I suspect that external devices will simply ignore the EH header; I have a horrible feeling that I'm being inconsistent with my balloting: normally I would ballot DISCUSS on documents which either add information to an in-flight packet, or which create any sort of closed domain, but in this case I feel that the document has sufficiently attempted to mitigate the (external) consequences of leaks that I'm choosing Abstain instead.",
