Should there also be a recommendation that DHCP addressed assigned should not be logged or that the life of such logs is short?\u00a0 If it's the case that operational practices is such that this information is not logged often, but if it's possible a recommendation would be very helpful, otherwise rotating the assigned IP addresses doesn't really offer any anonymity as was intended.",
