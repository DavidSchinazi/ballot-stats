The first one may just be something that I missed, but does this document actually say anywhere that there needs to be a real zone with real configured A and/or AAAA records for the query names used for these tests? The Appendix sort-of-mentions it, but I feel like there needs to be a mention in the main body text. The other point basically is a procedural one, in that we are in effect claiming a couple of leaf name prefixes in all domains to exhibit \"weird and surprising behavior\" (that is, for parties unaware of this specification).\u00a0 We generally try to avoid this sort of namespace squatting, preferring (e.g.) /.well-known for HTTP requests, various underscore-prefixed tricks for the DNS, etc.\u00a0 I see in the changelog that initial attempts did use an underscore prefix but ran into implementation difficulty, and acknowledge that using a \"magic\" name is much easier to get deployed than (e.g.) a new RR type.\u00a0 But I do not want the IESG to implicitly approve a namespace claim like this; it's better to be explicit about it if this is the best way to go.",
