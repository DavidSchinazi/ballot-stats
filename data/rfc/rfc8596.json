As far as I can tell, the comment made by the secdir reviewer of draft-ietf-mpls-sfc-04  about circular references between that document and RFCs 7665 and 8300 regarding security properties, is also somewhat applicable to this document.\u00a0 I do recognize the validity of first paragraph of the security considerations here (the NSH is an opaque payload for MPLS), but that in and of itself does not present a security analysis of the NSH in the MPLS environment.\u00a0 The last paragraph of the security considerations of this document attempts to provide some analysis, but it seems to be incomplete and perhaps overly optimistic, particularly with respect to the use of MPLS with Inter-Carrier Interconnect and the processing of MPLS traffic from external interfaces.\u00a0 Is there any reason not to fully harmonize (i.e., synchronize) the security considerations of  draft-ietf-mpls-sfc  and draft-ietf-mpls-sfc-encapsulation ?\u00a0 (I guess the first paragraph of this document's security considerations doesn't apply to the other document, that allocates extended-special-purpose label values, but that's the only thing I saw.)",
