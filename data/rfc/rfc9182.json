Many WGs in the routing area work on related technology, including bess, idr, lsr, pim, bfd, rtgwg, and teas. However, I found no evidence in the archives that any of these WGs were consulted or asked to review this work. Both points (lack of reuse and lack of review) have been mentioned in the mailing list, so I assume they have been considered.\u00a0 This fact and the existence of multiple implementations lead me to ABSTAIN.",

(2) In a similar vein as Roman's Discuss (and perhaps obviated by it?), if we're going to allow raw keys to be specified, as a string type, we should be very clear about whether the string is hex-encoded, base64-encoded, etc., in light of deployed experience with devices that take the string and use it as the raw key (thereby eliminating a good chunk of the key space from potential use).

(4) I'd also like to have a discussion about the NTP configuration options; in particular, we currently have an enumeration to select between broadcast client and broadcast server, with no option apparent for symmetric or other NTP modes.\u00a0 Given the rigidity of YANG enumerations, I'd like to confirm that no other NTP modes could be appropriate on the network access before we lock in to this model.",

While doing my due diligence to see if I missed or misunderstood something, I researched the RFCs mentioned in the beginning of the YANG module: \u00a0  This module uses types defined in [ RFC6991 ] and [ RFC8343 ].\u00a0 It also \u00a0  uses groupings defined in [ RFC8519 ], [ RFC8177 ], and [ RFC8294 ]. And found no use of the \"msec\" unit. A quick google search shows that  RFC 8299  uses it, so there is precedence for it, but I couldn't find its definition from that document either. All the other leaves use \"milliseconds\" (which is defined in  RFC 8294 ), so my preference would be to have consistency, if \"msec\" was defined and I just missed it. (Note that a similar remark could be made for \"bps\" used, which does not appear in the description text, and is also used in  RFC 8466 , however there is no issue about consistency there).",

        "text": "I am abstaining for similar reasons to Alvaro -- there are inconsistencies that make deriving the mapping between the model and implementations tricky. However, I don't really think that that is the \"fault\" of this document, but rather is an artifact of the fact that there are so many different \"types\" of VPNs, and every standard/implementation/vendor has their own special knobs and features. This makes creating a generic model largely impossible - it either needs to be so restrictive that it is basically pointless, or so comprehensive that it is unwieldily. I think that this document did a good job of trying to thread this needle (and I thank/congratulate the authors), but I still think that it is not really usable.  I also support Erik's discuss on Sec 7.6.2 -- this is also (I think) an artifact of trying to cover both too much and too little.",

This specification specifies qos classification based on L4 criteria and describes the procedure for TCP and UDP. It is possible that new L4 protocols (for example QUIC) use UDP as substrate hence can create ambiguity based of the procedure described in the specification. This specification should consider such potential substrate usage of L4 protocols (specially UDP) and hint on the potential augmentations (there might be several ways to do that) or scope it down to not support such cases.",
