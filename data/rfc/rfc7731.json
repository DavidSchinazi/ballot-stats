        "text": "I have two points that I want to discuss that should be relatively easy to address. 1. The document defines MPL Domain Address and indicates that all multicast data dissemination within an MPL domain is sent to that address.\u00a0 The document does not say how that address is selected or negotiated within a domain.\u00a0 One might infer from the 2nd paragraph of section 4.1 that the MPL Domain Address is the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address, but the wording of that section would make that an inference. Additionally, point #2 below makes me wonder if that is really the case.\u00a0 This document should be clear on the origin of the MPL Domain Address so that implementations do the right thing and can interact correctly. 2. Section 4.1 talks about devices participating in multiple MPL domains and segregating those domains by using different MPL Domain Addresses.\u00a0 Given the question above about how the MPL Domain Address is assigned/selected/negortiated, using the address to separate zones of the same scope is problematic.\u00a0 This spec should be clear that implementations need to follow the use of scope zone IDs ( RFC 4007 , Section 6) to keep different zones of the same scope separated.",
