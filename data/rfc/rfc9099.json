[ section 2.3.2.4 ] * \"Only trivial cases [...] should have RA-guard...\" \u00a0 Only?\u00a0 This doesn't strike me as being obviously the best recommendation. \u00a0 Definitely in trivial cases it should be enabled, but surely it should \u00a0 also be enabled even in more complex cases, albeit ones where \u00a0 knowledgeable administrators can configure things appropriately \u00a0 (vis. the applicability statement in section 1.1)...maybe?",
