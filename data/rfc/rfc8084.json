Rules 12 and 13 in section 4 seem more pertinent to sender-based flows than to tunnels. Is it best current practice to terminate all tunnel traffic in the face of long-term congestion rather than attempt to terminate/regulate the worst offenders within the tunnel? If the circuit breaker capability is implemented within the tunnel ingress point (as is recommended), it would seem straightforward to penalize the flow(s) causing the congestion rather than all the flows. Or am I misinterpreting the rules 12 and 13? 2. Does the need for these types of circuit breakers imply that raw UDP (and UDP-Lite) is no longer sufficiently functional and that DCCP (or an equivalent) needs to be used? 3. If this BCP is expecting to influence the implementation of traffic sources and sinks, should there be some guidance on what should be used (e.g., ECN) prior to invoking circuit breaker logic? The text says numerous times that CBs are a last resort, but I don't see much in the way of what should be used prior to this last resort.",
