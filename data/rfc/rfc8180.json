        "text": "I agree with Mirja's comments about the use of Normative Language and believe that for a BCP document its use is not clear enough such that it could result in different \"compliant\" implementations that may not interoperate properly.\u00a0 So I am making the issue a DISCUSS. As Mirja mentioned, this statement in the Introduction opens the door for other configurations: \"Any 6TiSCH compliant device SHOULD implement this mode of operation.\"\u00a0 The question to answer for this \"SHOULD\" (and others) is what are the particular circumstances when ignoring this recommendation is ok.\u00a0 The document doesn't elaborate at all on details. I understand that there are in fact other posible configurations, but if this document is describing the Best Current Practice then I think it should be explicit as to what that BCP is. Another example of the lack of clarity (besides those already mentioned by Mirja) is the use of RPL:\u00a0 The Introduction mentions that \"RPL is specified to provide the framework for time synchronization in an 802.15.4 TSCH network.\", but Section 5 (RPL Settings) makes it optional: \"In a multi-hop topology, the RPL routing protocol [ RFC6550 ] MAY be used.\"",
