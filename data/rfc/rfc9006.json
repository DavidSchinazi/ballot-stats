I would delete everything after the first sentence in this excerpt. While RFC6691  is informational, it clarifies  RFC1122 , which is a standard, and Sec 4.2.2.6 is quite clear that senders MUST consider TCP and IP option length when sizing TCP payloads. Absent any evidence that there are TCP endpoints or middleboxes that are violating  RFC1122 , further reducing the MSS because someone might be violating it is excessive.",
