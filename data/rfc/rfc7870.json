        "text": "As mentioned by Dave Thaler in his MIB doctor review: I was assigned to do the MIB doctor review of this document, since I previously did an early review of -03.\u00a0 My full comments are in the marked up copy at http://research.microsoft.com/~dthaler/draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-12.pdf Below is a summary of the issues called out therein. Substantive issues: 1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  RFC 4001  requires each InetAddress object to explicitly state which other InetAddressType object indicates the type.\u00a0 None of the objects in this document do so.\u00a0  RFC 7659  (the NATv2 MIB) does, and can be used as an example. 2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dsliteNATBindEntry includes dsliteTunnelStartAddPreLen in the INDEX. To confirm this was intended: Can you really have 2 entries that have all other INDEX values the same and differ only in the prefix length? 3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dsliteNATBindTable states that it extends natv2PortMapTable in  RFC 7659 , but rather than reusing the not-accessible objects from that table in its own INDEX clause, it defines its own.\u00a0 That\u2019s fine, but it is then not clear whether each such object in the dsliteNATBindTable INDEX needs to match a corresponding value in the natv2PortMapTable INDEX, or whether there can be additional entries that do not appear in the natv2PortMapTable.\u00a0  This should be clarified. 4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many objects in that table, such as dsliteNATBindMappingIntRealm, have very terse DESCRIPTIONs, whereas the DESCRIPTION of the corresponding object in the natv2PortMapTable is quite detailed.\u00a0 Hence this draft is far less clear than  RFC 7659 , since this draft has no such language. 5)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Objects of type InetAddress incorrectly have a REFERENCE clause pointing to the definition of the InetAddress TC. REFERENCE clauses should be used to point to the spec defining the semantics, rather than the syntax.\u00a0 For example, dsliteNATBindMappingIntAddress is incorrect, whereas the corresponding object in  RFC 7659  (natv2AddressMapInternalAddressType) is correct and points into the DS-Lite RFC ( RFC 6333 ). 6)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  I didn\u2019t understand DsliteNATBindEntry at all.\u00a0 Its dsliteNATBindMappingMapBehavior object has a value addressAndPortDependent(2) which \u201cmaps to a separate external address and port combination for each different destination address and port combination reached through the same external realm\u201d.\u00a0  However, the external port is in the INDEX clause and the destination address does not appear to be in the table at all.\u00a0 Since the 0 value for the external port already has a different special meaning, it can\u2019t be 0 either.\u00a0  So I don\u2019t understand how this table can work. 7)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dsliteAFTRAlarmProtocolType is underspecified.\u00a0 It\u2019s a string, but the description is very confusing as to what the legal string values are, making it sound more like an INTEGER was intended. (\u201cThis object indicate the protocol type of alarm, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 0:tcp,1:udp,2:icmp,3:total\u201d) E.g., does that mean the string is \u201c0:tcp\u201d or \u201c0\u201d or \u201ctcp\u201d or what? 8)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The dsliteStatisticTransmitted object seems to combine sent + received packets into a single counter with a name that implies only one direction. This is confusing, especially since most other MIB modules separate sent vs received into different counters. 9)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 dsliteAFTRUserSessionNumAlarm and dsliteAFTRPortUsageOfSpecificIpAlarm both refer to \u201cthe threshold\u201d without stating what threshold that is. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any such threshold object in this MIB module or elsewhere that I could find. 10)\u00a0  dsliteAFTRAlarmScalarGroup is mandatory and requires read-write access. But a lesson learned from the NAT MIB (and many other MIBs) is that many people don\u2019t want write support in their MIB modules.\u00a0 Does the WG really feel that write support is required in all implementations?\u00a0 I\u2019d recommend also having a read-only compliance statement, as is done in many other MIB modules. 11)\u00a0  The security considerations section uses the correct boilerplate for sensitive read-only objects, which includes \u201cThese are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability\u201d.\u00a0 However it then only lists the tables/objects and contains no discussion of their sensitivity/vulnerability. This is required in order to comply with MIB review guidelines in  RFC 4181 . 12)\u00a0  Per discussion on MIB Doctors, the root OID should probably not be { transmission xxx }, since that space usually implies that xxx is an ifType (not tunnel type) value. BENOIT: as discussed with the MIB Doctors, it should be under mib-2. 13)\u00a0  A number of undefined terms are used that I could not find in the DS-Lite RFC (6333) either, e.g., connection, session, etc.\u00a0 As such, I couldn\u2019t tell what was meant, and whether there were issues with the meaning.\u00a0 At minimum, REFERENCE clauses should be added to point to a specific section of a document that defines the terms.",
