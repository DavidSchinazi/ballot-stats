Having registered your \"gsma\" namespace and defined a \"urn:gsma:imei:\" sub-namespace, do you really want to require IETF consensus to create other sub-namespaces under \"urn:gsma:\"?\u00a0 That seems odd.\u00a0 I should think you'd want to have the authority to register things under \"urn:gsma:\" go to some GSMA management entity instead of to the IETF. I discussed this with Cullen, and I understand the issue: the SIP community wants to be sure that other sub-namespaces, with different semantics, can't be used where gsma:imei: URNs can, as an instance ID.  I think we're already mostly there, because the other document, draft-allen-dispatch-imei-urn-as-instanceid , is already full of references to \"GSMA IMEI URN\". I propose the following changes to this document, which should give full control of the gsma: URN namespace to GSMA, where it belongs, while highlighting that only the gsma:imei: URNs are applicable to the SIP instance ID.\u00a0 I've discussed this with Cullen, and he's OK with it.

FWIW, I appreciate that the authors were responsive to the privacy issues raised in that discussion, but I also think there's maybe a bit more work to be done. (1) I accept that there are valid uses for these URNs at least within mobile operator networks, but, like others, am concerned that we're defining a pretty invasive form of PII that can be perhaps too easily dropped into protocols that don't properly protect such information or that are typically not deployed with such protection enabled. I'm not sure how best to address this in general and would like to discuss that with the IESG and authors in general as well as the more specific discuss points below.  (2) I think the abstract should have a brief mention of the privacy issue, e.g. something like \"URNs from this namespace almost always contain Personally Identifying Information and need to be treated accordingly.\" If doing this, then a slightly longer paragraph along the same lines in the intro would probably also make sense. (3) Given that IMEIs are PII, and that devices may then emit those, would there not be value in defining an \"I'm not telling\" URN value that could be used by devices (whose users) would (sometimes) prefer privacy over convienence? As-is, when a protocol uses one of these URNs, then the only option is to not run the protocol or to expose the PII. Wouldn't the existence of such a URN value help there, e.g. perhaps \"urn:gsma:imei:anon\" or it could of course use the existing syntax but just some numbers never allocated to a real device as an IMEI, and I'm sure there are such values that could be added here as a special case.  (4) \"care SHOULD be taken\" seems meaningless to me and \"MUST NOT be delivered to devices that are not trusted\" is definitely meaningless in my universe (though perhaps it seems less so in GSM). I think you need to say when these URNs can be safely used, and then say that other uses are NOT RECOMMENDED. Is there a way to characterise that crisply? If there's not, then how is this safe really? (5) \"loosely correlated to a user\" seems like its trying to hide that IMEIs are PII. And \"messages intended to convey any level on anonymity\" is not meaningful - what does that really mean when you look at it? (I suspect that might just be unfortunate phrasing from IETF LC discussion.) I suggest you simply state that \"almost all IMEIs are almost always PII and so these URNs MUST be treated as PII in all cases.\"  (6) I personally think you should state that protocols carrying these URNs MUST or SHOULD do so over strongly hop-by-hop encrypted channels at least, and ideally encrypted end-to-end.\u00a0 I can imagine that might not fit with some real planned uses though, but I'd like to discuss it a bit to see.
