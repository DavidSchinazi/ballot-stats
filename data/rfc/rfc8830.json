I wondered about the privacy properties of these (and related) WebRTC identifiers, esp. if they are being handled at various different layers. Is there work somewhere in the WebRTC space that's analysing that? For example, one concern might be that msid-appdata could end up with some kind of privacy sensitive value, but there's no guidance here about that and as the examples use UUIDs it's not clear to me those represent nor what typical values will be used. (Note: I'm not saying that I believe this is a problem, I'm just checking if it's been considered.) I hope that there's no reason why these can't be very ephemeral values that don't identify (or help re-identification of) people or their preferences, locations etc., and I'd imagine there's little reason to e.g. log them. If that's the case wouldn't it be useful to add such guidance (somewhere, maybe not here) to help developers to do the right thing?",
