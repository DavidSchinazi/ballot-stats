        "text": "(1) The statement \"Bytes with no bits set at the end of the byte string are removed.\" in Section 6.7 seems confusing to the point of being potentially harmful, and I'm not sure why it needs to be there.\u00a0 In the context it appears in, it seems to leave the value to be used for the bit string offset in an ambiguous state.\u00a0 If the intent is that such strings should not be generated (and MAY/SHOULD/MUST be rejected by recipients), that's okay, but having them silently ignored is very surprising and may merit discussion. (2) I think we should discuss the relationship between this document and draft-ietf-core-sid , which are before the IESG at the same time.\u00a0 This document says that core-sid is \"one example for\" a specification defining the management of SIDs, but  draft-ietf-core-sid  claims to be the document that \"defines the semantics, the registration, and assignment processes of YANG SIDs\".\u00a0 I'm having a hard time seeing the two statements as compatible with each other, but maybe I'm missing something. (3) The second example of instance-identifier using SID (\u00a76.13.1) seems malformed, with \"key name country\" appearing under both \"list user\" and \"list authorized-key\" and no \"country\" leaf within \"list user\" other than the one under \"list authorized-key\".\u00a0 (The actual identityref example appears to correctly only use \"name\" as the key for \"list user\" and not \"list authorized-key\".) (4) Relatedly, the second example of instance-identifier by name (\u00a76.13.2) does not show a country for \"authorized-key\", and I'm not sure if that's a valid way to represent the given YANG element.",

The document should be clearer on its use of terminology around schema nodes.\u00a0 Mostly the encoding related to YANG data nodes, not YANG schema nodes.\u00a0 I've provided more information in the comments section. 2. As also raised by Ben, this document should probably cover the YANG data structure extension in  RFC 8791 .\u00a0 This could potentially be done in addition to rc:yang-data, but perhaps better in its place. 3. Did the WG consider supporting encoding YANG metadata ( RFC 7952 )?\u00a0 Presumably this would be expected to be covered as future work? 4. How does the CBOR encoding of SIDs apply to YANG features?\u00a0 This draft references features and the SID draft allows SIDs for them, but I don't understand how they are used in the encoding (since features don't appear in the instance data, they are only at the schema level).  5. I also support Ben's second discuss point.\u00a0 I think that as written, this draft needs a normative reference to the SID draft.",
