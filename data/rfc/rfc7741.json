From the shepherd writeup: \u00a0 \u00a0 There are a few ID nits. \u00a0 \u00a0 1) Unused reference:  RFC 3984 \u00a0 \u00a0 2) Obsolete normative reference:  RFC 4288  (Obsoleted by  RFC 6838 ) \u00a0 \u00a0 3) Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC:  RFC 6386 Why weren't these fixed before the document went out for Last Call and then IESG Evaluation?\u00a0 I don't care about #1, but... On #2, it's not just that 4288 is an obsolete reference.\u00a0 It's that the template used in Section 6.1 is from 4288, and that template *changed* in 6838.\u00a0 These idnits warnings have a purpose: you're supposed to fix the reference *and* you're supposed to make sure that the new reference still applies, and make any necessary changes to the document. The template changed in 6838 (\"Fragment identifier considerations\" was added; there were a couple of other minor changes, but that's the important one).\u00a0 The shepherd writeup says, \"The media subtype registration is compliant with the registration template ( RFC 6838 ).\"\u00a0 It is not.\u00a0 The procedure for media-type registrations also changed, but I don't think that affects this document. DISCUSS POINT 1: Please update the document with respect to  RFC 6838 . On #3, the downref was not called out in the Last Call message; that's required in order to support a downref, unless the referenced document is in the downref registry (which 6386 isn't).\u00a0 That means we'd need to re-run a two-week last call for that. DISCUSS POINT 2 (for the AD, not the authors): I think we need to re-run the Last Call for this document.",

        "text": "This discuss point should be easy to clear - there were just a couple of places that were too unclear for me to be confident that implementers would read them the same way. In 4.2.\u00a0 VP8 Payload Descriptor \u00a0  PictureID:\u00a0 8 or 16 bits including the M bit.\u00a0 This is a running \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 index of the frames.\u00a0 The field MUST be present if the I bit is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 equal to one.\u00a0 The 7 following bits carry (parts of) the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PictureID.\u00a0 If the extension flag is one, the PictureID continues \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 in the next octet forming a 15 bit index, where the 8 bits in the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 second octet are the least significant bits of the PictureID.\u00a0 If \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the extension flag is zero, there is no extension, and the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PictureID is the 7 remaining bits of the first (and only) octet. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The sender may choose 7 or 15 bits index.\u00a0 The PictureID SHOULD \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 start on a random number, and MUST wrap after reaching the maximum \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ID.\u00a0 The receiver MUST NOT assume that the number of bits in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PictureID stay the same through the session. Did I miss (or does everyone know) how to set the PictureID if you're using a 15-bit index, you have a current value that won't fit in 7 bits, and then the sender decides for whatever reason to start using 7-bit indexes? Should the receiver expect to see the lower 7 bits of the incremented 15-bit PictureID, a newly random 7-bit PictureID, 0, or \"something else\"? \u00a0  TL0PICIDX:\u00a0 8 bits temporal level zero index.\u00a0 The field MUST be \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 present if the L bit is equal to 1, and MUST NOT be present \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 otherwise.\u00a0 TL0PICIDX is a running index for the temporal base \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 layer frames, i.e., the frames with TID set to 0.\u00a0 If TID is \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 larger than 0, TL0PICIDX indicates which base layer frame the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 current image depends on.\u00a0 TL0PICIDX MUST be incremented when TID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 is 0.\u00a0 The index SHOULD start on a random number, and MUST restart \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 at 0 after reaching the maximum number 255. \u00a0  KEYIDX:\u00a0 5 bits temporal key frame index.\u00a0 The TID/KEYIDX octet MUST \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 be present when either the T bit or the K bit or both are equal to \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1, and MUST NOT be present otherwise.\u00a0 The KEYIDX field MUST be \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ignored by the receiver when the K bit is set equal to 0.\u00a0 The \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 KEYIDX field is a running index for key frames.\u00a0 KEYIDX MAY start \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 on a random number, and MUST restart at 0 after reaching the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 maximum number 31.\u00a0  I'm not quite sure why PictureID says \"MUST wrap\" and TL0PICIDX and KEYIDX say \"MUST restart at 0\". Are these the same thing (I would have thought so, but I'm not the codec guy). If they are the same, and you could consider using one term or the other in the document, that would be great. If they aren't the same, please say more about that.",
