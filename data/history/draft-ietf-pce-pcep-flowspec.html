 one L2 Flow Filter TLV or both Flow Filter TLV as well as L2 Flow Filter<br>&nbsp;  TLV, which describes a traffic flow."<br><br>&nbsp;  §6: "Only one Flow Filter TLV or L2 Flow Filter TLV can be present and<br>&nbsp;  represents the complete definition of a Flow Specification for traffic to<br>&nbsp;  be placed on the tunnel....The set of Flow Specification TLVs in a single<br>&nbsp;  instance of a Flow Filter TLV and L2 Flow Filter TLV are combined to<br>&nbsp;  indicate the specific Flow Specification.&nbsp; Note that the PCEP FLOWSPEC<br>&nbsp;  object can include just one Flow Filter TLV, just one L2 Flow Filter TLV,<br>&nbsp;  or one of each TLV."<br><br>&nbsp;  §7.1: "when both Flow Filter TLV and L2 Flow Filter TLV are present, they <br>&nbsp;  are combined to produce a more detailed specification of a flow"<br><br>That first sentence from §6 indicates one or the other, but the other text talks about the possibility of both.<br><br>If they are combined, how is that done?<br><br><br>(2) Entity Identifier<br><br>§5: The Speaker Entity Identifier TLV can be optionally included in the OPEN [<a href="/doc/rfc8232/">rfc8232</a>]...and it is required in the FLOWSPEC object.&nbsp; Should there be a relationship between the two?&nbsp; If the TLV is included in both objects, then I would expect the identifier to match.&nbsp; What should the receiver do if they don't match?<br><br>Related...&nbsp; Should a receiver check that the same identifier is included in all FLOWSPEC objects?&nbsp; What if they're not?<br><br><br>(3) §5: "All subsequent PCEP messages can identify the FlowSpec using the FS-ID."&nbsp; [This point is related to Ben's DISCUSS.]&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>The description of the use of the Speaker Entity Identifier TLV says that it is "used in conjunction with FS-ID to uniquely identify the FlowSpec information."&nbsp; I take this to mean that the FS-ID *and* the identifier in the TVL are used in the identification.&nbsp; Is that correct?<br><br>The text in §5 also talks about using only the FS-ID: "the Flow Specification identified with a FS-ID does not exist".&nbsp; And §8.3 emphasizes it again: "FS-ID field of the PCEP FLOWSPEC object is used to identify a specific Flow Specification".<br><br>If only the FS-ID is needed, what is the Speaker Entity Identifier used for?<br><br><br>(4) §8.4: "it is possible to to define these within a single PCEP FLOWSPEC object: for example, two Destination IPv4 Prefix TLVs could be included to indicate that packets matching either prefix are acceptable."<br><br>Two Destination Prefix TLVs would be equivalent to two Type 1 components in a BGP FS, but that is not allowed by rfc5575bis.&nbsp;

 implementation MAY ignore them.&nbsp; If the implementation checks the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification TLVs against those recorded for the FS-ID of the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification being removed and finds a mismatch, the Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification MUST still be removed and the implementation SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  record a local exception or log.<br><br>Which "Flow Specification MUST still be removed"?&nbsp; The one previously advertised using the FS-ID, or the one specified in the TLVs, or both?<br><br><br><br><br>[minor comments]<br><br>(6) §1: "For convenience we term the description of a traffic flow using Flow Specification Components as a "Flow Specification" and it must be understood that this is not the same as the same term used in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis</a>] since no action is explicitly included in the encoding."<br><br>&nbsp;

A given IP packet is <br>&nbsp;  said to match the defined Flow Specification if it matches all the <br>&nbsp;  specified criteria.<br><br>The actions are encoded separately.<br><br>Note that the definition in §2 of FlowSpec, apparently from rfc5574bis, is not included there.<br><br><br>(7) §5: "L bit...If the bit is set, only Flow Specifications that describe IPv4 or IPv6 destinations are meaningful in the Flow Filter TLV."&nbsp;

This doesn't seem to apply to<br>PCEP, so presumably we are supposed to ignore such requirements.&nbsp; Is<br>there a concrete list of which parts of the procedures are affected in<br>this way?<br><br>I agree with the TSV-ART reviewer that the Abstract and Introduction<br>could likely be improved by a restructuring.<br><br>In some places we call out that our usage of "Flow Specification"<br>diverges from that of 5575bis, since we do not have an "action", whereas<br>in other places we say that there is an implicit action of "forward all<br>matching traffic onto the associated path".&nbsp; It might be better to try<br>to stick to just one of these two worldviews.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>I did a little bit of a double-take at "may be unsolicited<br>instructions", given my understanding that PCE-initiated LSPs are at a<br>protocol level just requests to the PCC to initiate the path.<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; Decide what properties to assign to an LSP.&nbsp; This can include<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  bandwidth reservations, priorities, and DSCP (i.e., MPLS Traffic<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Class field).&nbsp; This function is also determined by user<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  configuration or response to predicted or observed traffic<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  demands.<br><br>nit: I think there's a missing word/words before "response", perhaps "as<br>a response to" or "in response to".<br><br>side note(?): I see that (4) refers to the "PCC" as signalling the LSP<br>across the network, but (5) refers to the "head end" being told what<br>traffic to put on the LSP.&nbsp; I can see how the respective functionalities<br>are important for those functions, but I am not sure if the roles will<br>ever be played by different entities (if they are always the same entity<br>there may be some rhetorical value in using a consistent term for that<br>single entity).<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Flow Specification information/state must be synchronized between<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PCEP peers so that, on recovery, the peers have the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; understanding of which Flow Specifications apply.<br><br>I don't remember seeing much specifically about recovery and state<br>synchronization in this document; should we have a little more<br>exposition (somewhere later on, perhaps §3.2.3) about how normal<br>recovery mechanisms suffice to synchronize the flowspec state along with<br>other LSP state?<br><br>Section 3.2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in<br>&nbsp;  a PCE's OPEN message indicates that the PCE can distribute FlowSpecs<br>&nbsp;  to PCCs and can receive FlowSpecs in messages from PCCs.<br><br>&nbsp;  The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in<br>&nbsp;  a PCC's OPEN message indicates that the PCC supports the FlowSpec<br>&nbsp;  functionality described in this document.<br><br>(nitty nit): is there a reason to not use the "supports the FlowSpec<br>functionality described in this document" for both cases?<br><br>&nbsp;  If either one of a pair of PCEP peers does not indicate support of<br>&nbsp;  the functionality described in this document by not including the PCE<br>&nbsp;  FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN Object in its OPEN message, then<br><br>(I expect the RFC Editor to ask about the apparent double negative here<br>if the text doesn't change before it gets to them.)<br><br>Section 3.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; PCRpt messages so that a PCC can report the traffic that the PCC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plans to place on the path.<br><br>(nit) I just want to confirm that "plans to place" is still correct,<br>given that <a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC 8231</a> defines PCRpt as "a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a<br>PCE to report the current state of an LSP".<br><br>&nbsp;  The PCEP FLOWSPEC object carries zero or one Flow Filter TLV or one<br>&nbsp;  L2 Flow Filter TLV or both Flow Filter TLV as well as L2 Flow Filter<br>&nbsp;  TLV, which describes a traffic flow.<br><br>(nit): this sentence was hard for me to parse ("zero or one&nbsp; or one<br> or ..." leaves the grouping of conditionals unclear).&nbsp; From<br>subsequent text, I believe that the allowed possibilities are (one Flow<br>Filter TLV and no L2 Flow Filter TLV), (no Flow Filter TLV and one L2<br>Flow Filter TLV), and (one Flow Filter TLV and one L2 Flow Filter TLV).<br>If that's correct, I'd suggest rephrasing this more like "carries either<br>or both of the Flow Filter TLV and the L2 Flow Filter TLV".<br><br>Section 4<br><br>I'm a bit confused as to the usage of the two-octet "value" field that<br>is apparently always set to 0, the same as the padding.&nbsp; I would perhaps<br>have expected some kind of flags word if there was to be any non-trivial<br>content in this capability TLV.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  the PCEP object format defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc5440/">RFC5440</a>].&nbsp; It is OPTIONAL in the<br>&nbsp;  PCReq, PCRep, PCErr, PCInitiate, PCRpt, and PCUpd messages and MAY be<br>&nbsp;  present zero, one, or more times.&nbsp; Each instance of the object<br>&nbsp;  specifies a traffic flow.<br><br>(I know we've covered this before, and apologize for the noise, but I<br>feel obligated to note that "zero, one, or more times" is equiavlent to<br>"zero or more times" anyway.)<br><br>&nbsp;  The PCEP FLOWSPEC object carries a FlowSpec filter rule encoded in a<br>&nbsp;  TLV (as defined in Section 6).<br><br>nit: not just a single TLV, per se, right?<br><br>&nbsp;  FS-ID (32-bits): A PCEP-specific identifier for the FlowSpec<br>&nbsp;  information.&nbsp; A PCE or PCC creates an FS-ID for each FlowSpec that it<br>&nbsp;  originates, and the value is unique within the scope of that PCE or<br>&nbsp;  PCC and is constant for the lifetime of a PCEP session.&nbsp; All<br>&nbsp;  subsequent PCEP messages can identify the FlowSpec using the FS-ID.<br>&nbsp;  The values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF are reserved and MUST NOT be used.<br><br>It might be worth a reference to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> (I'm AD sponsoring it) as<br>guidance for how the FS-ID is generated.&nbsp; There does not seem to be a<br>need even for monotonicity of assignment, so some of the random<br>assignment schemes might be best.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 7.&nbsp; Only one Flow Filter TLV or L2 Flow Filter TLV can be<br>&nbsp;  present and represents the complete definition of a Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification for traffic to be placed on the tunnel.&nbsp; This tunnel is<br><br>nit: I suggest rewording, as the current wording might be taken as<br>implying that having both Flow Filter and L2 Flow Filter at the same<br>time is forbidden; perhaps, "at most one Flow Filter TLV and one L2 Flow<br>Filter TLV can be present".&nbsp; (I do see that the explicit list of options<br>is given again a few sentences later.)<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Though value 0 is currently reserved by the BGP specs, we are perhaps<br>setting ourselves up for a conflict if it ever becomes "un-reserved" for<br>BGP.&nbsp; Lumping it into the 1..255 range doesn't seem like it would<br>introduce any problems, and would ameliorate this risk.&nbsp; (Doing this<br>would have knock-on effects on text throughout the rest of the<br>document.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Type values are chosen so that there can be commonality with Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specifications defined for use with BGP [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis</a>].<br><br>We probably should reference <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6/">draft-ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6</a> here as well,<br>since our TLV can work with either IPv4 or IPv6, but the corresponding<br>BGP registry is different.<br><br>&nbsp;  The content of the Value field in each TLV is specific to the type/<br>&nbsp;  AFI and describes the parameters of the Flow Specification.&nbsp; The<br><br>This suggests that any new allocations from the PCEP-only range should<br>say what AFI(s) they are defined for, but no such guidance is provided<br>in Section 10.3.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>(Same comment about the value 0 as above.)<br><br>&nbsp;  All L2 Flow Specification TLVs with Types in the range 1 to 255 have<br>&nbsp;  Values defined for use in BGP (for example, in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis</a>] and [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6/">I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6</a>]) and are<br>&nbsp;  set using the BGP encoding, but without the type octet (the relevant<br>&nbsp;  information is in the Type field of the TLV).&nbsp; The Value field is<br><br>nit: this "all [...] in the range 1 to 255 have Values defined for use<br>in BGP" makes it sound like they are all currently defined, which does<br>not seem to be the case.&nbsp; Rewording to something like "L2 Flow<br>Specification TLVs with Types in the range 1 to 255 have their Value<br>interpreted as defined for use in BGP ([...]) and are set using the BGP<br>encoding, but without the type octet" might help.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  not the addition of a new flow as described in Section 8.4.&nbsp; The FS-<br>&nbsp;  ID field of the PCEP FLOWSPEC object is used to identify a specific<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification.<br><br>I'd suggest mentioning again that this is in conjunction with the<br>Speaker Entity Identity TLV.<br><br>&nbsp;  When modifying a Flow Specification, all Flow Specification TLVs for<br>&nbsp;  the intended specification of the flow MUST be included in the PCEP<br>&nbsp;  FLOWSPEC object and the FS-ID MUST be retained from the previous<br>&nbsp;  description of the flow.<br><br>(and likewise, if there is a requirement to preserve the Speaker Entity<br>Identity TLV, though perhaps that's already required by <a href="/doc/rfc8232/">RFC 8232</a>.)<br><br>Section 8.5<br><br>&nbsp;  To remove a Flow Specification, a PCEP FLOWSPEC object is included<br>&nbsp;  with the FS-ID matching the one being removed, and the R bit set to<br><br>(Presumably the Speaker Entity Identity TLV also has to match?)<br><br>&nbsp;  If the R bit is set and Flow Specification TLVs are present, an<br>&nbsp;  implementation MAY ignore them.&nbsp; If the implementation checks the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification TLVs against those recorded for the FS-ID of the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification being removed and finds a mismatch, the Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification MUST still be removed and the implementation SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  record a local exception or log.<br><br>Thank you for specifying the behavior in the event of a mismatch!<br><br>Section 8.7<br><br>&nbsp;  PCCs MUST apply the same ordering rules as defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis</a>].<br><br>(side note) I noted in my ballot comments on 5575bis that the ordering<br>rules allow for situations where the priority of a rule with given<br>semantic content can be different depending on how it is encoded, which<br>seems risky to me.&nbsp; It would in principle be possible for this document<br>to impose additional restrictions on how things are encoded to remove<br>this potential disparity, though I do not actually expect us to want to<br>do so (hence, this is just a side note).<br><br>&nbsp;  Furthermore, it is possible that Flow Specifications will be<br>&nbsp;  distributed by BGP as well as by PCEP as described in this document.<br>&nbsp;  In such cases implementations supporting both approaches MUST apply<br>&nbsp;  the prioritization and ordering rules as set out in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis</a>] regardless of which protocol distributed<br><br>This MUST seems to just be saying the same thing as the previous<br>paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;  the Flow Specifications, however implementations MAY provide a<br>&nbsp;  configuration control to allow one protocol to take precedence over<br>&nbsp;  the other as this may be particularly useful if the Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification make identical matches on traffic but have different<br>&nbsp;  actions.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>And this MAY seems to be contradicting the MUST, making it "no longer a<br>MUST".<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification that it cannot resolve against other Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specifications already installed MUST respond with a PCErr message<br><br>I'm not entirely sure I understand what "resolve against" means in this<br>context -- if I had to guess, it would be something about having a<br>unique interpretation that is not in conflict with existing rules, but<br>I'm pretty hazy on what the details of that would entail.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>We should probably say that&nbsp; is specified in <a href="/doc/rfc5440/">RFC 5440</a>.<br><br>I also couldn't tell if there was a clear rule we are using for when to<br>expand out sub-structures that we are not modifying vs. leaving them to<br>the referenced document.&nbsp; Many are left out, but we do expand, e.g.,<br> in PCUpd/PCRpt.<br><br>(I also note that we cover PCUpd and PCRpt in the reverse order to <a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC<br>8231</a>, not that it really matters for much of anything.)<br><br>Section 12<br><br>&nbsp;  modified or torn down.&nbsp; Such systems, therefore, apply security<br>&nbsp;  considerations as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc5440/">RFC5440</a>], [<a href="/doc/rfc6952/">RFC6952</a>], and [<a href="/doc/rfc8253/">RFC8253</a>].<br><br>In my reading, the security considerations of <a href="/doc/rfc6952/">RFC 6952</a> are directed more<br>at protocol designers than at operators; could you say a little more<br>about what you expect the reader to take away from that reference?<br><br>Also, I think that at least some of the security considerations from<br>5575bis are also relevant to our usage of the data structures.<br><br>&nbsp;  The description of Flow Specifications associated with paths set up<br>&nbsp;  or controlled by a PCE add a further detail that could be attacked<br>&nbsp;  without tearing down LSPs or SR paths, but causing traffic to be<br>&nbsp;  misrouted within the network.&nbsp; Therefore, the use of the security<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms for PCEP referenced above is important.<br><br>I might consider mentioning that the BGP flowspec work can use the "same<br>originator" check for flowspec destination address and longest-prefix<br>match for routes to that address, which is unavailable in the PCEP<br>scenario.&nbsp; On the other hand, the PCE is fairly trusted already, so<br>maybe there is less need for such a check in the PCEP case.<br><br>&nbsp;  usually considered private customer information.&nbsp; Therefore,<br>&nbsp;  implementations or deployments concerned with protecting privacy MUST<br>&nbsp;  apply the mechanisms described in the documents referenced above.<br><br>(A construction of the form "if you care about , you MUST "<br>doesn't actually impose much of a normative requirement...)<br><br>&nbsp;  Although this is not directly a security issue per se, the confusion<br>&nbsp;  and unexpected forwarding behavior may be engineered or exploited by<br>&nbsp;  an attacker.&nbsp; Therefore, implementers and operators SHOULD pay<br>&nbsp;  careful attention to the Manageability Considerations described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 13.<br><br>I appreciate that you mention this risk in this way; thanks!<br><br>Section 13.1<br><br>&nbsp;  which path.&nbsp; Unlike the behavior in a distributed routing system, it<br>&nbsp;  is not important that each head-end implementation applies the same<br>&nbsp;  rules to disambiguate overlapping Flow Specifications, but it is<br>&nbsp;  important that:<br><br>Just to check my understanding: this is "important" in the sense of<br>"important to the stability of the network"?<br><br>Section 13.3<br><br>This section seems like it could be roughly summarized as "someone<br>should please write some YANG".&nbsp; My personal preference would be to say<br>this more along the lines of "YANG models describing the functionality<br>in this document have not yet been written, but are desirable.&nbsp; Some<br>relevant preexisting work is: [...]", but I can understand if your<br>preferences are different (or there is precedent for this kind of<br>formulation).<br><br>Section 15.2<br><br>Since we depend on <a href="/doc/rfc4364/">RFC 4364</a> for the format of the RD, that seems to make<br>it a normative reference.<br><br>(We also use <a href="/doc/rfc7399/">RFC 7399</a> as the source for a couple of defined terms, but<br>that doesn't seem like a big deal to me, personally.)<br><br>I think technically you need <a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC 8231</a> to implement the updated PCUpd<br>message we define, which arguably makes it normative as well.&nbsp; (Likewise<br>8281 for PCInitiate.)<br><br>We do, however, require <a href="/doc/rfc8232/">RFC 8232</a> for the Speaker Entity Identifier TLV,<br>which is required in the FLOWSPEC object, so it's clearly a normative<br>reference.</div></td>
