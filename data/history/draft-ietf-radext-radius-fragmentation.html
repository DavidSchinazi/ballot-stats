But I do want to briefly DISCUSS a procedural point. I am quite sure I will clear the DISCUSS on the call.<br><br>The issue of "Updates" worries me a bit. Here's the part that concerned me:<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that if this experiment does not succeed, the<br>&nbsp;  "T" flag allocation would not persist, as it is tightly associated to<br>&nbsp;  this document.<br><br>That's true, but using Updates will mean that <a href="/doc/rfc6929/">RFC 6929</a> will *always* have an "Updated By" pointer pointing to this Experimental RFC. That itself could cause serious confusion, and would likely result in the "T" allocation never being able to be used again.<br><br>I really don't think this document needs to, or should, update the other documents. 2865 and 6158 are only being updated because this document violates a MUST and a SHOULD. But it's an experiment. Any implementation of 2865 or 6158 not participating in the experiment is going to need to honor those MUSTs and SHOULDs. There's no real reason to call out this update to people who are only looking at those two documents. 6929 is a bit trickier, because of the issue of other folks trying to use the reserved value, but as you say in the document: "not such a great number of specifications extending that field are expected." If/when this document goes to Standards Track, that's the time to let people know. If there's a real fear of this experiment interfering with other implementations, it really is time to make the registry. Finally, I'm concerned about the precedent of Experimental documents updating Standards Track and BCP docs, especially on the grounds provided. Perhaps there's a case for that to happen once in a while, but we don't want pointers to possibly failed experiments to be in the meta-data forever.<br><br>Like I said, we can sort this on the call pretty quickly. But I want to make sure we understand the implications here.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>This document is aiming for Experimental status. This is the correct choice because it <br>proposes complex changes to the RADIUS operational model to achieve transmission <br>of payload sizes beyond the current maximum (4096 bytes). It aims for backward <br>compatibility when being transmitted over legacy intermediate proxy systems which are<br> not yet upgraded to support the requirements of this document. The real-life suitability <br>of these changes needs further study; hence Experimental. There are other <br>approaches to the same problem discussed in the working group, but they are not <br>backwards compatible to non-upgraded proxies.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is<br>&nbsp;  limited to a total packet size of 4096 octets.&nbsp; Provisions exist for<br>&nbsp;  fragmenting large amounts of authentication data across multiple<br>&nbsp;  packets, via Access-Challenge.&nbsp; No similar provisions exist for<br>&nbsp;  fragmenting large amounts of authorization data.&nbsp; This document<br>&nbsp;  specifies how existing RADIUS mechanisms can be leveraged to provide<br>&nbsp;  that functionality.&nbsp; These mechanisms are largely compatible with<br>&nbsp;  existing implementations, and are designed to be invisible to<br>&nbsp;  proxies, and "fail-safe" to legacy clients and servers.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  The content of this document was discussed at length in the working<br>&nbsp;  group, and there are multiple other approaches to the same problem.<br>&nbsp;  The document thus got significant exposure at the experts of the<br>&nbsp;  working group. The document has a few rough edges which were the cause<br>&nbsp;  of discussions. Considering the target status of Experimental, they<br>&nbsp;  appear minor enough to carry on with the experiment. The authors have<br>&nbsp;  documented the friction points in their section 11 "Operational<br>&nbsp;  Considerations". 11.1 in particular shows a process question: is it<br>&nbsp;  appropriate for an Experimental RFC to update a Standards-track RFC?<br>&nbsp;  The document attempts to follow that course; if this is ultimately<br>&nbsp;  agreed after IESG review, the text in that section will be changed<br>&nbsp;  accordingly.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp;  At least one implementation is known which implements this<br>&nbsp;  specification: FreeRADIUS. The sheperd has no information about plans of<br>&nbsp;  other vendors. There were no particular expert reviews outside the<br>&nbsp;  working group process; i.e. no MIB doctor review nor Media Type review<br>&nbsp;  (and no need for those two as the document contains neither MIBs nor <br>&nbsp;  requests a Media Type). Since the document adds new transport<br>&nbsp;  capabilities, a thorough review by transport experts (e.g. TSVDIR) during<br>&nbsp;  IETF Last Call would be appreciated.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp;  The Document Shepherd is Stefan Winter .

For the PROTO write-up, he gave the <br>then-latest version -06 a fresh read; which resulted in a number of minor changes <br>which are now the -08 version which is ready for advancement in the publication <br>process.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No concerns; the document was read by and commented on by a comparatively high<br> number of participants.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The document addresses a very specific RADIUS shortcoming and this document's <br>impact does not appear to matter from a broader perspective at first glance. However, <br>the document introduces a new transport property for RADIUS (fragmentation support)<br> which deserves a close look by transport area experts. There may be issues with <br>traversing AAA proxies which are unaware of this document, but those issues have <br>been uncovered during the WG review process and are enumerated in section 11.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The issue described in 11.1 had no final conclusive answer; i.e. is it better to a) have <br>this document update a standards-track document, or b) have an IANA registry for the <br>flag field assignments, or c) just do nothing. The working group consensus went for a), <br>which is fine IMO, but the text in 11.1 will need to be updated with more confident <br>language once it is determined if that course of action is acceptable process-wise.<br><br>From a more general point of view, the entire solution is rather bulky and not very <br>elegant; but it solves an actual problem and operates despite possible presence of <br>unaware proxies on the path, which is a significant plus.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>During the PROTO Write-Up, the sheperd asked each author and they all confirmed <br>that they have no outstanding IPR disclosures.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There was no IPR disclosure.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is one group of individuals which was pushing for this document: the ABFAB WG <br>and implementers of the corresponding specs needed this solution and so far, use <br>cases beyond ABFAB have yet to surface. Naturally, these participants were most <br>active and drove most of the discussions. However, more participants than just those <br>were reviewing and commenting on the document, so there is solid consensus behind <br>the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If <br>so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire<br> is publicly available.)<br><br>There was one individual who expressed major disconsent during the call for adoption,<br>and also on various design choices before and after adoption. There was no threat of <br>appeal though.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>"The 'Updates: ' line in the draft header should list only the _numbers_<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  of the RFCs which will be updated by this document (if approved); it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  should not include the word 'RFC' in the list."<br><br>There is a dangling reference [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS] (section pointer) which<br>can be fixed later in the publication process.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>There are no MIBs, media types, or URI requests in this document.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All normative references are issued RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references (1 x Informational, 2 x BCP, 3 x standards-track).<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc6929/">RFC6929</a>. That document is mentioned in the introduction, but <br>not the abstract. The reason why it is omitted in the abstract is because the relationship<br> is relatively minor (a previously reserved flag is defined for use in this document) and <br>because there are two dedicated sections (8 + 11.1) which explain the update <br>relationship in considerable detail.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document introduces two new attributes, one new value for an existing attribute, <br>and a registry for an enumeration of values for one of those new attributes. The IANA <br>consideration section contains all the info required by IANA to perform the reservations <br>in question. Future allocations of the new registry are defined (RFC required). The <br>name for the registry ('RADIUS Frag-Status "Code" registry') is reasonable.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The new registry is 'RFC required'; no experts needed.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There are no formal language constructs in the document.</div></td>

Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>"The 'Updates: ' line in the draft header should list only the _numbers_<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  of the RFCs which will be updated by this document (if approved); it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  should not include the word 'RFC' in the list."<br><br>There is a dangling reference [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS] (section pointer) which<br>can be fixed later in the publication process.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>There are no MIBs, media types, or URI requests in this document.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All normative references are issued RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references (1 x Informational, 2 x BCP, 3 x standards-track).<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc6929/">RFC6929</a>. That document is mentioned in the introduction, but not the abstract. The reason why it is omitted in the abstract is because the relationship is relatively minor (a previously reserved flag is defined for use in this document) and because there are two dedicated sections (8 + 11.1) which explain the update relationship in considerable detail.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document introduces two new attributes, one new value for an existing attribute, and a registry for an enumeration of values for one of those new attributes. The IANA consideration section contains all the info required by IANA to perform the reservations in question. Future allocations of the new registry are defined (RFC required). The name for the registry ('RADIUS Frag-Status "Code" registry') is reasonable.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The new registry is 'RFC required'; no experts needed.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There are no formal language constructs in the document.</div></td>
