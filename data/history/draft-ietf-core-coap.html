Nothing blocking, but for your consideration:<br><br>By section number:<br><br>4.2/4.3: "Reject" in the sense it is talked about in these sections is an internal state change. That's confusing to me, as the normal sense of the English word implies a party that "hears about" the rejection. (It's hard to me to think of a circumstance where someone or something was "rejected" and only the rejector ever knew about it.) In your use, "silently ignore" is one possible form of rejection. That's just weird.<br><br>If you're going to do this, I'd define the term up front. Maybe even capitalize "Reject" wherever you use it.<br><br>Either way, in both 4.2 and 4.3, "MUST reject" is probably wrong (since that's an internal state and nothing a protocol requirement is useful for) and "MAY involve sending" is a strange construction.<br><br>4.5: I think the MAYs confuse things and might encourage implementers to take that path. Instead of:<br><br>&nbsp;  This rule MAY be relaxed in case<br>&nbsp;  the Confirmable message transports a request that is idempotent (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 5.1) or can be handled in an idempotent fashion.&nbsp; Examples<br>&nbsp;  for relaxed message deduplication:<br>&nbsp;  <br>I suggest: "Exceptions to this are when the Confirmable message transports a request that is idempotent (see Section 5.1) or can be handled in an idempotent fashion.&nbsp; Examples of these exceptions:". Also:<br><br>&nbsp;  As a general rule that MAY be<br>&nbsp;  relaxed based on the specific semantics of a message, the recipient<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD silently ignore any duplicated Non-confirmable message, and<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD process any request or response in the message only once.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I suggest: "The recipient SHOULD silently ignore any duplicated Non-confirmable message, and SHOULD process any request or response in the message only once, though the specific semantics of the message might dictate an exception."<br><br>4.6: I feel like this section is really one big implementation note: Because it is a layer violation, it's not clear to me that any implementer has the ability to figure out much of this. (For example, the idea that an implementer would be willing to -- or even know how to -- set the Do Not Fragment bit or figure out the Path MTU is a bit hopeful.) I have no objection to this section, but it might be better as an implementation note rather than a set of protocol instructions.<br><br>5.3.2: Change "the client will likely send a Reset message so it does not receive any more retransmissions" to "the client will send". A client that has lost state that receives what it will see as a random CON message will always send back a Reset.<br><br>5.4.6: If it were me, I would have put the NoCacheKey bits in the high four bits of the most significant byte so that you could simply do a &lt;224 test for cache-matching options. I suppose this ship has sailed.<br><br>5.5.1: The implementation note notwithstanding, I don't understand why Content-Format is not a SHOULD.<br><br>8.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  A server SHOULD be aware that a request arrived via multicast, e.g.<br>&nbsp;  by making use of modern APIs such as IPV6_RECVPKTINFO [<a href="/doc/rfc3542/">RFC3542</a>], if<br>&nbsp;  available.<br><br>That SHOULD is not meaningful. It is useful, not required with exceptions (as SHOULD indicates), for the server to know that it is using multicast.<br><br>This also gives a reason not to allow RST on *any* NON messages.<br><br>12.1: I think it would be much easier to figure these out if you separated out the bit fields of code type and code, and then had sub-registries for request codes, success codes, client error codes, and server error codes.</div></td>

This 576 bytes for IPv4 are mentioned in the implementation note, but deserves text on the same level as for IPv6. <br><br>4) Ensuring no fragmentation with IPv4&nbsp; -- fixed.<br><br><br><br>5) Reaction to network errors that are signalled<br>I wonder why the draft is not discussing any reaction to network failures signalled through ICMP messages. This relates also to my DISCUSS issue no 4. <br><br>6) Idempotency&nbsp; -- fixed.<br><br><br>7) Protocol reactions to reserved or prohibited values<br>Regarding reserved or prohibited values in the IANA section, it would be useful to be clear about what happens when those values are seen. I.e., should they be ignored, generate an error, etc.<br><br>8) Flow Control/Receiver Buffer<br>The protocol does not have any real means for the receiver to control the amount of data that is being sent to it. I can understand the attempt to provide a simple protocol, but adding a very basic flow control mechanism will not prohibitively increase the complexity of the protocol, while improving robustness. <br>According to Section 2.1, a node can always return a RST if the message cannot be process for whatever reason. <br>I propose to add an option to the RST message that allows the message receiver to state how much data it is willing to accept from a particular sender or in general (up to the implementation).&nbsp; <br><br>9) Handling a wrapping message IDs<br>According to Section 4.4.:<br>"The same Message ID MUST NOT be re-used (in communicating with the same endpoint) within the EXCHANGE_LIFETIME (Section 4.8.2)" with EXCHANGE_LIFETIME of 247s. <br>By now it is unrealistic that the message ID of 16 bits will wrap around in that time frame, but protocols live long and at some later time it can be possible. <br>However, the protocol doesn't have any means to detect wrapped message IDs.</div></td>

I have no way as a client to say, "I really can only accept format X, and if you can't make format X, I don't want something else", and I have no way to distinguish that from "I would prefer format X, but am willing to take whatever you can give me." For the former, I have to be prepared to throw things away. For the latter, I have to be willing to send two requests, the first with Accept (potentially getting back 4.06), and then a re-request without Accept. Which one of the above are current clients doing? If it's the former, then I suggest making this into an implementation note, and I would even consider getting rid of the 4.06 response code&nbsp; for this use case, since it is nearly useless, and probably harmful. If it's the latter, then these SHOULDs ought to be MUSTs and the option should be critical so that clients can stop doing that.</div></td>

(All other class values are reserved.)" <br><br>4.1: Personally, I find the word "empty" confusing here. "Null" or "Noop" probably would have been better. If this use is already well understood, it's probably best to define it clearly. Capitalizing "Empty" might help.<br><br><br>4.2/4.3: "Reject" in the sense it is talked about in these sections is an internal state change. That's confusing to me, as the normal sense of the English word implies a party that "hears about" the rejection. (It's hard to me to think of a circumstance where someone or something was "rejected" and only the rejector ever knew about it.) In your use, "silently ignore" is one possible form of rejection. That's just weird.<br><br>If you're going to do this, I'd define the term up front. Maybe even capitalize "Reject" wherever you use it.<br><br>Either way, in both 4.2 and 4.3, "MUST reject" is probably wrong (since that's an internal state and nothing a protocol requirement is useful for) and "MAY involve sending" is a strange construction.<br><br>4.5: I think the MAYs confuse things and might encourage implementers to take that path.

Also:<br><br>&nbsp;  As a general rule that MAY be<br>&nbsp;  relaxed based on the specific semantics of a message, the recipient<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD silently ignore any duplicated Non-confirmable message, and<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD process any request or response in the message only once.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I suggest: "The recipient SHOULD silently ignore any duplicated Non-confirmable message, and SHOULD process any request or response in the message only once, though the specific semantics of the message might dictate an exception."<br><br>4.6: I feel like this section is really one big implementation note: Because it is a layer violation, it's not clear to me that any implementer has the ability to figure out much of this. (For example, the idea that an implementer would be willing to -- or even know how to -- set the Do Not Fragment bit or figure out the Path MTU is a bit hopeful.) I have no objection to this section, but it might be better as an implementation note rather than a set of protocol instructions.<br><br>5.3.2: Change "the client will likely send a Reset message so it does not receive any more retransmissions" to "the client will send". A client that has lost state that receives what it will see as a random CON message will always send back a Reset.<br><br>5.4.6: If it were me, I would have put the NoCacheKey bits in the high four bits of the most significant byte so that you could simply do a &lt;224 test for cache-matching options. I suppose this ship has sailed.<br><br>5.5.1: The implementation note notwithstanding, I don't understand why Content-Format is not a SHOULD.<br><br>5.7.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  a proxy SHOULD be conservative<br><br>s/SHOULD/should.

I've left the comments<br>in below from last time, but didn't check 'em against -17.<br><br>--- former discuss points<br><br>(1) I think you made a change to 5.6 for this but I still<br>think (now at COMMENT level) that it'd be really good to say<br>that CoAP is currently well defined only for URI schemes like<br>coap(s) and http(s) but maybe not others. Basically, you need<br>a scheme://host:port syntax or else you have to do some more<br>specification work to get CoAP interop.<br><br>(3) You now say "SHOULD use 32 bits of randomness" which<br>is ok. I think it might be worth adding that CoAP nodes<br>that might be targetted with many guesses SHOULD also&nbsp; <br>detect and react to that.<br><br>Text of discuss (3) was:<br>4.2, last para: this creates an attack that can work<br>from off-path - just send loads of faked ACKs with guessed<br>Tokens and some of 'em will be accepted with probability<br>depending on Token-length and perhaps the quality of the RNG<br>used by the sender of the CON. That could cause all sorts of<br>"interesting" application layer behaviour. Why is that ok?<br>(Or put another way - was this considered and with what<br>conclusion?) I suspect you need to have text trading off the<br>Token length versus use of DTLS or else CoAP may end up too<br>insecure for too many uses. (Note: the attack here is made<br>worse because the message ID comparison can be skipped.<br>Removing that "feature" would help a lot here.) 5.3.1's<br>client "may want to use a non-trivial, randomized token"<br>doesn't seem to cut it to me. How does this kind of<br>interaction map to DTLS sessions/epoch? Basically, I'd like<br>to see some RECOMMENDED handling of token length that would<br>result in it not being unsafe to connect a CoAP node to the<br>Internet. (And please note recent instances where 10's of<br>thousands of insecure devices have been found via probing<br>the IPv4 address space. These are real attacks.)<br> <br>(4) 4.4, implementation note - this seems unwise since it<br>means that once Alice has interacted with Bob, then Bob can<br>easily guess the message IDs that Alice will use to talk to<br>Charlie. This is no longer a DISCUSS because you said that<br>the WG figure its ok and given you say to randomise at<br>the start (of what?) then its marginal. <br><br>--- old comments below, sorta checked against -16 <br><br>intro, 2nd para: better to not talk about the WG name and<br>its work really, but about the resulting protocol<br><br>intro, last para: more sales pitch language<br><br>3: Message ID - with 16 bits that imposes a rate limit on<br>how often you can send. I don't think that's described and<br>I'm curious as to whether it'd set to max goodput for CoAP<br>that'd be way less than otherwise possible with e.g. HTTP.<br>- I think in a mail Carsten said its 250/second max or <br>something, I still think this'd be great information to<br>say explicitly early on in the spec since it might prevent<br>someone spending a lot of effort before they find out that<br>CoAP doesn't work for their use-case.<br><br>7.1 - what if I want to only do discovery via DTLS? What<br>does "support" mean for port 5683 then? Carsten said that<br>you do need to still listen on 5683 even if you only<br>want to do work on . I'm not so happy about that but<br>its not DISCUSS level.<br><br>12.7 - as it turns out I also don't see why this needs<br>two ports - the cost is two more bytes for security which<br>is significantly-enough less than the current cost (in<br>terms of message size) for security. Am I wrong? Carsten<br>responded: "yep, that's what we want" and I'm ok with that,<br>if not convinced.</div></td>

I understand that configuring these parameters<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is out of scope for the doc, so assume changing the parameters is out of<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scope as well.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes.&nbsp; The assumption is that implementations better don't start<br>&gt; changing the parameters until there is a good way to do so.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you start deploying new devices into that environment with<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; significantly different parameters, is it more likely that performance<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; would suffer, or that something would break? (I don't care what the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; answer is, I'd just like for the reader to have one - do you HAVE to get<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the parameters right the first time, or do you WANT to get them right,<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but you can deploy new devices with different parameters and let the old<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devices be removed/replaced over time?)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The answer is different for each parameter and for the direction in<br>&gt; which you change it.&nbsp; I don't think we can provide all the definitive<br>&gt; answers in this document.<br><br>For "changing the parameters" above ... I think what you're saying in your response to me is more helpful than the way I read the text in -16. If I'm understanding correctly, the situation is <br><br>- the specification doesn't include a way to change parameters without a "flag day", and <br><br>- if an application environment uses consistent parameters, everything will work, but <br><br>- if an application environment doesn't use consistent parameters, what happens next is out of scope for this specification (and, for extra credit, is unpredictable)<br><br>As a COMMENT, I'd be more comfortable if <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  It is recommended that an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  application environment use consistent values for these parameters.<br><br>continued to say "Operation with inconsistent values in an application environment is outside the scope of this specification", or something like that. <br><br>As an aside, also as a COMMENT ... I am now noticing that the specification has "recommended" in lower case. If you were telling me it's "RECOMMENDED = SHOULD = do it this way unless you're sure what you're doing, and if you think you know what you're doing, but you break it, you own it", I'd be more comfortable. That's consistent with the way I read this text in 2119:<br><br>3. SHOULD&nbsp;  This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there<br>&nbsp;  may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a<br>&nbsp;  particular item, but the full implications must be understood and<br>&nbsp;  carefully weighed before choosing a different course. <br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This one is on the edge of being a Comment:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 5.10.5.&nbsp; Max-Age<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The value is intended to be current at the time of transmission.<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Servers that provide resources with strict tolerances on the value of<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Max-Age SHOULD update the value before each retransmission.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will servers know that resources they serve have strict<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tolerances?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes.&nbsp; It is typically in the nature of a resource to be replaced<br>&gt; periodically (e.g., the ECB exchange rate -- this has a very specific<br>&gt; Max-Age) or be on a more unpredictable basis.&nbsp; In the CoRE model,<br>&gt; servers generally should be aware about the nature of the resources<br>&gt; they are serving.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; answer may be "yes", I'm just asking. If not, I'm wondering if this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should be a MUST.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Because both the condition on the SHOULD and the desired behavior are<br>&gt; very much local matter, a MUST won't have a much different outcome<br>&gt; here.&nbsp; Maybe the SHOULD should be turned into a non-RFC 2119<br>&gt; implementation guidance recommendation.<br><br>Your explanation was very helpful to me. I'm fine with SHOULD as 2119 language here - that matches what I'm hearing you say.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This one is on the edge of being a comment:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 7.2.&nbsp; Resource Discovery<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The discovery of resources offered by a CoAP endpoint is extremely<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; important in machine-to-machine applications where there are no<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; humans in the loop and static interfaces result in fragility.&nbsp; A CoAP<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endpoint SHOULD support the CoRE Link Format of discoverable<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resources as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC6690</a>].<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is it obvious that this is a SHOULD? Is CoRE Link Format necessary for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resource discovery, or can you also accomplish this with humans if<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they're in the loop? I'm just trying to wrap my head around "it's<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; extremely important but implementations might not do it".<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is more of a policy statement, a statement of expectation: If you<br>&gt; want to be part of the CoRE ecosystem, do CoAP and do <a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a>,<br>&gt; because that will maximize interoperability.&nbsp; So this may be another<br>&gt; SHOULD abuse.&nbsp; (But it does impact interoperability!)<br><br>This is very helpful. What I wasn't getting was whether there was any way other than CoRE Link Format to discover resources when there are no humans in the loop.<br><br>Again, as a COMMENT, I'm reading this response as "SHOULD support the CoRE Link Format of discoverable resources as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC6690</a>] if there are no humans in the loop, to maximize interoperability". Am I getting that right? <br><br>And if this is a statement of expectation, I'm OK with SHOULD, if the working group thinks that's appropriate.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COMMENT:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think this specification is well-written, it's important, and a lot of<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; people will need to read it - that's why I'm being picky on comments.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Martin already has a DISCUSS about some of the more transport-ish topics<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (support for UDP-lite, etc.).

Given that 404 and<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.04 are similar, for example, I'd expect some implementers to guess what<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; less common CoAP response codes are, based on HTTP response codes, rather<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than check carefully. That's an obscure comment, but I thought I should<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ask.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; We already deviate from a strict one-to-one correspondence with HTTP<br>&gt; (e.g., we have a 2.05 where HTTP uses 200).&nbsp; So "correspond" may<br>&gt; indeed be too strong.&nbsp; [1386]<br><br>Ack.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 6.4.&nbsp; Decomposing URIs into Options, is "fail this algorithm" clear?<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It might be a term of art for HTTP folk, but I'm not familiar with it.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp; If |url| has a&nbsp; component, then fail this algorithm.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Indeed, this is hixiefied speak (right out of text in the versions of<br>&gt; the websockets spec that were current when we wrote this, and still in<br>&gt; HTML5).&nbsp; It might be shorter to just say "fail", but the intent is not<br>&gt; for the node to blow up in smoke, but to specifically fail the<br>&gt; algorithm defined in this section (as explained in the introduction to<br>&gt; 6.4).<br><br>No, I think you're doing this right (thanks for the clue!).<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 8.1.&nbsp; Messaging Layer<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When a server is aware that a request arrived via multicast, it MUST<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOT return a RST in reply to NON.&nbsp; If it is not aware, it MAY return<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a RST in reply to NON as usual.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doesn't this tell me that the MUST NOT is not required for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interoperability? I'm only quibbling about the use of 2119<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; language.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This hand-waving is a reaction on a specific restriction of the POSIX API<br>&gt; that I don't wish on anyone.&nbsp; "Please avoid using <a href="/doc/rfc3542/">RFC3542</a>-challenged<br>&gt; environments.&nbsp; But if you have to (.NET?)..."<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On a<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; related point, if there was a sentence that started out "to keep Bad<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thing X from happening, ..." that would be helpful.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Good point.&nbsp; [1387]<br><br>Ack. <br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's similar language in 8.2.&nbsp; Request/Response Layer<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When a server is aware that a request arrived via multicast, the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server MAY always ignore the request, in particular if it doesn't<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have anything useful to respond (e.g., if it only has an empty<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; payload or an error response).<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but MAY is pretty weak anyway (maybe "can always ignore the request", to<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; avoid the 2119 question?).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; This is trying to say that the peer has to be able to cope with the<br>&gt; "MAY"-type behaviour described, so it does affect interoperability and<br>&gt; I think 2119 language is appropriate here.<br><br>I understand why you're using 2119 language now.

Makes things so much easier to review.&nbsp; Just want to discuss a couple of things before moving to yes (hopefully).<br><br>0) s9.1.3.2: Before I get in to the nitty-gritty of the specific concerns I have with DTLS use of Raw Public Keys, I have to ask whether use of the DTLS client_certificate_url extension was considered?&nbsp; If raw public keys is just about size then that'd work wouldn't it.&nbsp; If you're about dumping processing of paths, then that's another thing.<br><br>1) s9.1.3.2.1: What's really hung me up on this draft is the raw public key option.&nbsp; Primarily, the TLS draft is not quite done yet; I'm still in discussions with the authors.&nbsp; Two issues that affect your draft:<br><br>a)&nbsp;  By <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey/">draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey</a> taking a pass on specifying all of the ways an identity can be bound to a public key, it leaves it up to the application to specify that mechanism.&nbsp; This binding is important because you can't get peer authentication without it; I'm really worried that if this mode gets widely deployed people will say they have "DTLS security" but few (if any) are actually do the work necessary to bind the identity to the key.&nbsp; &nbsp; So, you specify that binding in the provisioning section (good ;) but I want to make sure that it's clear who's doing what to whom:<br><br>i) s9.1.3.2.1: For machines it's perfect appropriate to generate the key and install it because we doubt it'll be able to do that well enough right (i.e., crummy entropy sources)?&nbsp; I want to make it clear that that's been done by the manufacturer.<br><br> In this mode the device has an asymmetric key pair but without an<br> X.509 certificate (called a raw public key).<br> <br>to:<br><br> In this mode the device has an asymmetric key pair but without an<br> X.509 certificate (called a raw public key); the asymmetric key<br> paid is generated by the manufacturer and installed on the device.<br><br>ii) s9.1.3.2.1: This draft does that binding using Stephen's naming thing with hashes, but I want to make sure that it's clear who is identifier, it now says:<br><br>&nbsp; An identifier is calculated<br>&nbsp; from the public key as described in Section 2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6920/">RFC6920</a>]. <br><br>Is it the <br><br>&nbsp; An identifier is calculated by the endpoint from<br>&nbsp; from the public key as described in Section 2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6920/">RFC6920</a>]. <br><br>b) <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey/">draft-ietf-tls-oob-pubkey</a> is likely to take a pass on specifying a mechanism for revoking the public key and identity binding.&nbsp; Note that ocsp-/multi-ocsp staplingwon't work because there's no way to request information about a certificate that you don't have information about.&nbsp;  I'm not trying to gold plate the security mechanism here but I think we need some words on how revocation for this mode will be handled.&nbsp; However, I suspect you'll want to use the ACLs....there's a mechanism for including ACLs during provisioning but is there a way to update them later?&nbsp; What happens if a new node gets installed or removed?&nbsp; Is there a requirement for ACLs to be supported; the text has a SHOULD but that seems to be about ACL provisioning support not ACL support.<br><br>2) s9.1.3.2: Another TLS-related issue:<br><br>When referring to TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 please include the MTI curve(s).&nbsp; Ever so glad that conservative curves are being used.&nbsp; In the following, I assumed you'd want the one must and the two mays but I can understand if you don't.&nbsp; I'd argue you do have algorithm agility with DTLS so you could get away with just the MUST ad not the MAYs.<br><br>Unrelated to you, but I thought I'd let you know about: the curve requirements will almost certainly be removed from the mcgrew draft at my direction because no other D/TLS EC cipher suite specifies an MTI curve.&nbsp; There's support for conservative curves, but not enough interest in starting to add MTI curves instead of the application picking them.&nbsp; Note the Zigbee folks also point to the mcgrew draft but it seems their drafts already include the curves so we ought to be good to go on both fronts.<br><br>I think we need to be clear that choosing this particular cipher suite that it means an implementation needs to support the extensions defined in <a href="/doc/rfc4492/">RFC 4492</a> - or if it doesn't.&nbsp; I'm assuming you want it to so I'm going to propose some tweaking:<br><br>OLD:<br><br>&nbsp; Implementations in<br>&nbsp; RawPublicKey mode MUST support the mandatory to implement cipher<br>&nbsp; suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 as specified in<br>&nbsp;

It would be good to get this feedback documented at some point. <br><br>Here are the issues (based on my own review and input from Joe Touch and Michael Scharf):<br><br>1) IPv6 UDP checksum calculation<br>It is not clear if zero UDP checksums are permitted or not permitted with COAP.?<br>(UDP zero checksums:<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6man-udpzero/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6man-udpzero/</a>)<br>That should be specified.<br><br>2) Handling of UDP-lite<br>Can UDP-lite (<a href="/doc/rfc3828/">RFC 3828</a>) be used or cannot be used in conjunction with CoAP?<br><br><br>3) Fragmentation of messages<br>The recommendation in Section 4.6 about the path MTU is generally valid only for IPv6. For IPv4, 567 bytes is the safe area to work without fragmentation, though in today WANs 1280 work perfectly, but I am not so sure about the networks envisioned for CoAP. This 576 bytes for IPv4 are mentioned in the implementation note, but deserves text on the same level as for IPv6. <br><br>4) Ensuring no fragmentation with IPv4<br>The implementation note in Section 4.6 states that for IPv4 it is 'harder to ensure that there is no IP fragmentation'. This neglects the possibility of using the Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IPv4 header and also that there is possibly feedback from a node enroute that the MTU is too big if the DF flag is set, i.e., by means of an ICMP error message. <br>Should there be any recommendation or protocol machinery to deal with path probing? E.g., referencing <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a> (PMTUD). <br><br><br>5) Reaction to network errors that are signalled<br>I wonder why the draft is not discussing any reaction to network failures signalled through ICMP messages. This relates also to my DISCUSS issue no 4. <br><br>6) Idempotency<br>done.<br><br>7) Protocol reactions to reserved or prohibited values<br>Regarding reserved or prohibited values in the IANA section, it would be useful to be clear about what happens when those values are seen. I.e., should they be ignored, generate an error, etc.<br><br>8) Flow Control/Receiver Buffer<br>The protocol does not have any real means for the receiver to control the amount of data that is being sent to it. I can understand the attempt to provide a simple protocol, but adding a very basic flow control mechanism will not prohibitively increase the complexity of the protocol, while improving robustness. <br>According to Section 2.1, a node can always return a RST if the message cannot be process for whatever reason. <br>I propose to add an option to the RST message that allows the message receiver to state how much data it is willing to accept from a particular sender or in general (up to the implementation).&nbsp; <br><br>9) Handling a wrapping message IDs<br>According to Section 4.4.:<br>"The same Message ID MUST NOT be re-used (in communicating with the same endpoint) within the EXCHANGE_LIFETIME (Section 4.8.2)" with EXCHANGE_LIFETIME of 247s. <br>By now it is unrealistic that the message ID of 16 bits will wrap around in that time frame, but protocols live long and at some later time it can be possible. <br>However, the protocol doesn't have any means to detect wrapped message IDs.</div></td>

Given that 404 and 4.04 are similar, for example, I'd expect some implementers to guess what less common CoAP response codes are, based on HTTP response codes, rather than check carefully.

Is this saying the server shouldn't return large resources for NoSec requests (whatever "large" means), or ? If this is saying the same thing as the text on using "slicing/blocking mode" two paragraphs, down, it would be clearer to combine these points in a single paragraph, or otherwise describe "large amplification factors SHOULD NOT be done".</div></td>

(Note: the attack here is made<br>worse because the message ID comparison can be skipped.<br>Removing that "feature" would help a lot here.) 5.3.1's<br>client "may want to use a non-trivial, randomized token"<br>doesn't seem to cut it to me. How does this kind of<br>interaction map to DTLS sessions/epoch? Basically, I'd like<br>to see some RECOMMENDED handling of token length that would<br>result in it not being unsafe to connect a CoAP node to the<br>Internet. (And please note recent instances where 10's of<br>thousands of insecure devices have been found via probing<br>the IPv4 address space.

The nodes often have 8-bit<br>&gt; microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while<br>&gt; constrained networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error<br>&gt; rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is<br>&gt; designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart<br>&gt; energy and building automation.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between<br>&gt; application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of resources,<br>&gt; and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet<br>&gt; media types. CoAP easily interfaces with HTTP for integration<br>&gt; with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as<br>&gt; multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for<br>&gt; constrained environments.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Working Group Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt; WG review has been intense, with input from many participants<br>&gt; beyond the document authors, and particularly input from<br>&gt; implementers.&nbsp; There are no particular controversies to note.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Document Quality<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There have been multiple expert reviews, from security,<br>&gt; applications (once a general review, and once specifically on the<br>&gt; URI schema), and transport areas. All the reviews produced useful<br>&gt; input, that resulted in significant changes to the specification.<br>&gt; All review feedback is now incorporated in the final document.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; There are at least 15 publically disclosed implementations, both<br>&gt; commercial and open-source. There have been several<br>&gt; interoperability events, and a high level of interoperability has<br>&gt; been reported from those events.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Personnel<br>&gt; Document Shepherd is Andrew McGregor <br>&gt; Responsible Area Director is Barry Leiba <br>&gt; Zach Shelby&nbsp; is suggested as the designated<br>&gt; expert for the IANA registries defined in Sections 12.2 and 12.3.<br>&gt; <br>&gt;</div></td>

It seems like what you intended was something<br>like this:<br><br>	&nbsp; &nbsp;  There is no expectation and no need to perform<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  normalization within a CoAP implementation, since senders<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are expected to be implemented with pre-normalized<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  strings.&nbsp; However, strings received from non-CoAP sources<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SHOULD be normalized where possible.<br><br>Of course, there's actually no value to normalization in this case if<br>it can't be depended on, and I suspect that you don't want to make<br>that a MUST.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  strings representing the same text.<br><br>I don't have a strong opinion about how this should be done, but it<br>seems like the text as written doesn't give clear guidance.&nbsp;

I<br>realize that this goes somewhat against the idea of sharing<br>nomenclature with HTTP, but I think the clash between safe/unsafe<br>options and safe/unsafe methods is confusing enough that you aren't<br>really benefiting from that anyway.<br><br>In 5.9: as a user and implementor of RESTful systems who has learned<br>by doing more than by reading, the term "action result" is somewhat<br>opaque to me.&nbsp; I think I know what it means, but it might be nice to<br>explain what it means before using it like this:<br><br>&nbsp;  Like HTTP 201 "Created", but only used in response to POST and PUT<br>&nbsp;  requests.&nbsp; The payload returned with the response, if any, is a<br>&nbsp;  representation of the action result.<br><br>5.9.2.2: I think you mean "first" rather than "previously":<br><br>&nbsp;  The client is not authorized to perform the requested action.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without previously improving its<br>&nbsp;  authentication status to the server.&nbsp; Which specific mechanism can be<br>&nbsp;  used for this is outside this document's scope; see also Section 9.<br><br>5.10.1: how does the client know that an endpoint hosts multiple<br>virtual servers in time to leave out the Uri-Host option?&nbsp; Is this<br>literally just in the case where the hostname appears in the URI to be<br>decomposed as an IP address literal?<br><br>&nbsp;  are sufficient for requests to most servers.&nbsp; Explicit Uri-Host and<br>&nbsp;  Uri-Port Options are typically used when an endpoint hosts multiple<br>&nbsp;  virtual servers.<br><br><br>In 5.10.8.2: I can't quite understand what is meant here.&nbsp; I could see<br>it meaning either or both of the following:<br><br>&nbsp;  1. If If-None-Match appears in a query with one or more If-Match<br>&nbsp;  options, and none of the If-Match options match, the condition is<br>&nbsp;  fulfilled.<br>&nbsp;  2. If If-None-Match appears in a query, no If-Match options may<br>&nbsp;  appear in that query; the condition is met if the target doesn't<br>&nbsp;  exist.<br><br>I think that the text means just (2), but because of the name of the<br>option, I want it to mean (1), even though the text doesn't say that,<br>and since the text doesn't say that If-None-Match and If-Match are<br>mutually exclusive, I can easily imagine someone reading the text and<br>carelessly assuming that it means (1) or (1 or 2).<br><br>In 6.4, why /url/?&nbsp; This is really confusing--I was halfway through<br>this section, and kind of confused, before I realized that the slashes<br>were for emphasis, and weren't path separators.<br><br>Also in 6.4, the text does not account for the case where there's a<br>user part to the authority section of the URI.</div></td>

(Its in the nature of very very long<br>documents that the accumulation of such stuff generates more<br>discuss points.) Anyway, let's discuss...<br><br>(1) 2.3: What if the URI scheme doesn't have a host or port<br>or path or query?&nbsp; Also in 5.6, 2nd bullet in list: Just to<br>note that if you were using ni URIs with CoAP, then you no<br>longer need to insist on exactly the same URI (e.g. the<br>authority part needn't matter with ni URIs, the alg-val part<br>is what counts). That might be true of other schemes too, so<br>perhaps this statment is scheme specific to some extent?<br>This is just a discuss point to check that you're ok with<br>CoAP being restricted to some URI schemes in this manner,<br>the ni URI case is just an example I happen to know fairly<br>well:-) So I'll clear this one when told that this is<br>considered acceptable but I want to check the general issue<br>about uri-scheme dependencies for CoAP. The same point<br>occurs in 5.7.1 and maybe elsewhere btw. So basic point is:<br>please provide some sensible description of which URI<br>schemes can be used with CoAP and which cannot.<br><br>(2) 4.2, "when the timeout is triggered" - what happens with<br>sleepy nodes that only wake on external events, and where<br>e.g. if 2 timeouts have elapsed whilst asleep? Not sure if<br>odd behaviour of that kind could cause much harm, but was it<br>considered? This could also affect the definition in 4.8.2<br>of MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN.<br><br>(3) 4.2, last para: this creates an attack that can work<br>from off-path - just send loads of faked ACKs with guessed<br>Tokens and some of 'em will be accepted with probability<br>depending on Token-length and perhaps the quality of the RNG<br>used by the sender of the CON. That could cause all sorts of<br>"interesting" application layer behaviour. Why is that ok?<br>(Or put another way - was this considered and with what<br>conclusion?) I suspect you need to have text trading off the<br>Token length versus use of DTLS or else CoAP may end up too<br>insecure for too many uses. (Note: the attack here is made<br>worse because the message ID comparison can be skipped.<br>Removing that "feature" would help a lot here.) 5.3.1's<br>client "may want to use a non-trivial, randomized token"<br>doesn't seem to cut it to me. How does this kind of<br>interaction map to DTLS sessions/epoch? Basically, I'd like<br>to see some RECOMMENDED handling of token length that would<br>result in it not being unsafe to connect a CoAP node to the<br>Internet. (And please note recent instances where 10's of<br>thousands of insecure devices have been found via probing<br>the IPv4 address space. These are real attacks.)<br><br>(4) 4.4, implementation note - this seems unwise since it<br>means that once Alice has interacted with Bob, then Bob can<br>easily guess the message IDs that Alice will use to talk to<br>Charlie.<br><br>(5) 4.6, last para&nbsp; - this only applies to insecure uses of<br>CoAP, you should point that out<br><br>(6) 6.2 - "the UDP datagrams MUST...use DTLS" is fine but<br>maybe not enough, if the request uses DTLS then presumably<br>so MUST *all* response messages, and they MUST use the same<br>DTLS session? Or perhaps one with the same authenticated<br>endpoints. Don't you need to say that? If you don't then<br>just sending the request via DTLS but getting (some)<br>response messages in clear would seem to be allowed.&nbsp; I<br>think 9.1 might cover all the above, but want to just check.<br><br>(7) 9.1.1, 1st para: what is "the server" - is that the<br>destination host from the URI? If yes, then fine.&nbsp; If no,<br>then we need to DISCUSS that. <br><br>(8) 9.1.3.3 - "signed by an appropriate chain of trust" is<br>an odd phrase - do you mean it MUST be validated as per <a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC<br>5280</a> section 6? If so, say so. If not, say what you do mean.<br>(But we might need to talk about it in that case,<br>depending;-)<br><br>(9) 9.1.3.3 - you don't mention certificate status checking.<br>I can see why that's hard to impossible in some n/w's but<br>entirely ignoring it seems wrong. Perhaps call out the<br>vulnerability and point at OCSP stapling as a potential<br>solution, but one that requires further work and/or further<br>specification?<br><br>(10) 10.1 - what does https mean here? If it means that<br>the request/response are in clear between the source and<br>proxy and then encrypted then a) you really really need to<br>say that clearly and b) why is that even acceptable and c)<br>what if the destination resource requires client auth? It<br>just seems broken to pretend to use https this way. Going<br>via a cross-proxy breaks security.&nbsp; Similarly, what does<br>coaps mean in 10.2?</div></td>

Might be no harm<br>to distinguish that explicitly from Message ID.<br><br>2.3: For what "security reason" are proxies useful? <br><br>3: Ver field "MUST set this field to 1" - I guess someone<br>might set both bits to 1, so saying '01'B might be better.<br><br>Section 3: I didn't see where Message ID wrap-around was<br>described. I see Martin has a discuss on that which I<br>support.<br><br>3: Message ID - with 16 bits that imposes a rate limit on<br>how often you can send. I don't think that's described and<br>I'm curious as to whether it'd set to max goodput for CoAP<br>that'd be way less than otherwise possible with e.g. HTTP.<br><br>3.2: So I can't have an option with a uint value where<br>missing != 0? Might be worth saying.<br><br>4.1: middle two paragraphs seem like repetition - maybe they<br>could be deleted?<br><br>4.2, 1st para, "acknowledge such a message" - do you mean<br>all CONs or just an empty CON? splitting up this para into a<br>few or using a bullet list or pseudo-code would be better I<br>think.<br><br>4.2, "a random number between 2 and 3" (replacing names with<br>defaults) - ought you recommend some minimun granularity<br>just in case some careless developer did something like:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  initialTimeout=ACK_TIMEOUT+<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rand()%(ACK_TIMEOUT*ACKRANDOM_FACTOR-ACK_TIMEOUT)<br><br>4.3, last sentence in parenthesis - I have no idea what that<br>means<br><br>4.4, last para: I just wonder if any NAT or v6 transition<br>schemes might invalidate this MUST?<br><br>4.6, 1st sentence: don't get that, maybe better deleted.<br><br>4.8.1, DEFAULT_LEISURE is in table 1 but not discussed until<br>section 8, a fwd ref at least would be good<br><br>5.2.2, "The server maybe initiates..." seems too casual.<br><br>5.3.1, 3rd para - the note about using the same token for<br>different source ports seems broken to me. I don't think you<br>say anything to the effect that the response has to go to<br>that source port.<br><br>5.4.6, option numbers can be 16 bits long, in that case bit<br>7 is not the lsb - does that need fixing? Similarly with<br>Figure 11.<br><br>5.5.2, I buy your argument here about language tagging, but<br>what happens at a CoAP-&gt;HTTP g/w? Doesn't language tagging<br>become an issue there? How's that handled?<br><br>5.10.1 - can any of the valid options for Host from 3986 be<br>used? e.g. IPv6 addresses as text in square brackets,<br>decimal form IPv4 addresses? You do have some guidance later<br>but I think that'd be bettern being more obvious.<br><br>5.10.5 - I'm probably just confused by reading so much;-) If<br>there are two Max-Age options, which wins? Where's that<br>stated in general?<br><br>5.10.8.1 - I don't get why its ok to not say which If-Match<br>to pick if more than one matches. Why's that?<br><br>6.1 - I don't get what you mean by saying that the coap URI<br>scheme "supports" /.well-known, maybe that'll be clear in<br>section 7. (I don't think it was.)<br><br>6.2 - s/for privacy// - DTLS does authentication, integrity<br>and confidentiality, not privacy<br><br>7.1 - what if I want to only do discovery via DTLS? What<br>does "support" mean for port 5683 then?<br><br>7.2 - I didn't really get how this works, but I assume that<br>if I re-read <a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC6690</a>, then I'd get it. Is that a good<br>assumption?<br><br>8.2.1, 1st para - this talks about "the cache" but I don't<br>think you've (so far) told me that clients that send<br>multicast requests have to have a cache for responses. Don't<br>you need to?<br><br>8.2.2 - Please make it clear(er) that bormann-coap-misc is<br>properly an informative ref. (Assuming it is.)<br><br>section 9, last para: what's that mean? I got the feeling<br>the text was trying to hide something from me fwiw.<br><br>6.5 - I thin you need a security consideration somwhere<br>about comparing coap(s) URIs and the potential for access<br>control screw-ups. <br><br>9.1 - have people implemented the ECDH ciphersuites in CoAP<br>testing? Knowing if this is just text or also running code<br>might help discuss resolution.<br><br>9.1.3.3 - throwing in RSA as a SHOULD (albeit within a<br>section that's a MAY) is odd - if devices can do RSA then<br>why not have 'em all do it for the raw public keys and get<br>the interop gains that will accrue from that.<br><br>11.5 - this is a bit detailed, wouldn't a reference do<br>most of it?<br><br>12.7 - as it turns out I also don't see why this needs<br>two ports - the cost is two more bytes for security which<br>is significantly-enough less than the current cost (in<br>terms of message size) for security.

It would be good to get this feedback documented at some point. <br><br>Here are the issues (based on my own review and input from Joe Touch and Michael Scharf):<br><br>1) IPv6 UDP checksum calculation<br>It is not clear if zero UDP checksums are permitted or not permitted with COAP.?<br>(UDP zero checksums:<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6man-udpzero/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-6man-udpzero/</a>)<br>That should be specified.<br><br>2) Handling of UDP-lite<br>Can UDP-lite (<a href="/doc/rfc3828/">RFC 3828</a>) be used or cannot be used in conjunction with CoAP?<br><br><br>3) Fragmentation of messages<br>The recommendation in Section 4.6 about the path MTU is generally valid only for IPv6. For IPv4, 567 bytes is the safe area to work without fragmentation, though in today WANs 1280 work perfectly, but I am not so sure about the networks envisioned for CoAP. This 576 bytes for IPv4 are mentioned in the implementation note, but deserves text on the same level as for IPv6. <br><br>4) Ensuring no fragmentation with IPv4<br>The implementation note in Section 4.6 states that for IPv4 it is 'harder to ensure that there is no IP fragmentation'. This neglects the possibility of using the Don't Fragment (DF) flag in the IPv4 header and also that there is possibly feedback from a node enroute that the MTU is too big if the DF flag is set, i.e., by means of an ICMP error message. <br>Should there be any recommendation or protocol machinery to deal with path probing? E.g., referencing <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a> (PMTUD). <br><br><br>5) Reaction to network errors that are signalled<br>I wonder why the draft is not discussing any reaction to network failures signalled through ICMP messages. This relates also to my DISCUSS issue no 4. <br><br>6) Idempotency<br>The discussion of idempotency is useful, but overlooks message order. I.e., the discussion appears to assume that a sequence of the same actions has the same effect as a single action, but this is true only if different sets of actions (from different sources, or copies of different actions from a single source) aren't interleaved. This should be addressed. <br><br>7) Protocol reactions to reserved or prohibited values<br>Regarding reserved or prohibited values in the IANA section, it would be useful to be clear about what happens when those values are seen. I.e., should they be ignored, generate an error, etc.<br><br>8) Flow Control/Receiver Buffer<br>The protocol does not have any real means for the receiver to control the amount of data that is being sent to it. I can understand the attempt to provide a simple protocol, but adding a very basic flow control mechanism will not prohibitively increase the complexity of the protocol, while improving robustness. <br>According to Section 2.1, a node can always return a RST if the message cannot be process for whatever reason. <br>I propose to add an option to the RST message that allows the message receiver to state how much data it is willing to accept from a particular sender or in general (up to the implementation).&nbsp; <br><br>9) Handling a wrapping message IDs<br>According to Section 4.4.:<br>"The same Message ID MUST NOT be re-used (in communicating with the same endpoint) within the EXCHANGE_LIFETIME (Section 4.8.2)" with EXCHANGE_LIFETIME of 247s. <br>By now it is unrealistic that the message ID of 16 bits will wrap around in that time frame, but protocols live long and at some later time it can be possible. <br>However, the protocol doesn't have any means to detect wrapped message IDs.</div></td>

But if you're going to allow this, I don't understand the MAY: Doesn't rejecting the message require sending a Reset? Otherwise, the message has not been rejected; it's simply been ignored. The second part is either redundant or confusing: What else might I do with a rejected message other than send the Reset and ignore it? I think this needs rewriting.<br><br>5.2.2: It is probably worth saying somewhere in here: "Once the server sends back an empty Acknowledgement, it MUST NOT send back the response in another Acknowledgement, even if the client retransmits another identical request. If a retransmitted request is received (perhaps because the original Acknowledgement was delayed), another empty Acknowledgement is sent and any response MUST be sent as a separate response."<br><br>5.4.2: Cache-Key is undefined, here or in any other document I can find. It probably needs an explanation somewhere in this document.<br><br>5.5: Again, I don't like the combination of MUST NOT include/MUST ignore. I would drop the MUST ignore part.<br><br>5.10.4:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  return the preferred Content-Format if available.&nbsp; If the preferred<br>&nbsp;  Content-Format cannot be returned, then a 4.06 "Not Acceptable"<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD be sent as a response.<br><br>What are the exceptions to the above two SHOULDs? If the preferred format is available, when would a server not return it. If it's not available, when would the server return other than "Not Acceptable"? Also, since Accept is not marked as "Critical", why isn't it *always* treated as elective and therefore ignored if the server can't satisfy the request? (In other words, shouldn't you also have a "Critical Accept" option defined?)</div></td>

If a NON message can't be ACKed, why can it be RST? This seems like additional machinery for the client.<br><br>2.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the response to a request<br>&nbsp;  carried in a Confirmable message is carried in the resulting<br>&nbsp;  Acknowledgement (ACK) message.&nbsp; This is called a piggy-backed<br>&nbsp;  response, detailed in Section 5.2.1.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  If the server is not able to respond immediately to a request carried<br>&nbsp;  in a Confirmable message, it simply responds with an empty<br>&nbsp;  Acknowledgement message so that the client can stop retransmitting<br>&nbsp;  the request.&nbsp; When the response is ready, the server sends it in a<br>&nbsp;  new Confirmable message (which then in turn needs to be acknowledged<br>&nbsp;  by the client).<br><br>It took me a bit to figure out why things worked this way, and I think a sentence or two of explanation would be useful. A piggy-backed response to a Confirmable request doesn't itself need to be confirmable because if the ACK gets lost, the client will&nbsp; re-transmit the request until it gets the answer. When the response to a Confirmable request is not piggy-backed, the response should itself be Confirmable, since a Confirmable request will normally want a guaranteed response.<br><br>&nbsp;  Likewise, if a request is sent in a Non-confirmable message, then the<br>&nbsp;  response is usually sent using a new Non-confirmable message,<br>&nbsp;  although the server may send a Confirmable message.<br><br>"Likewise" seems wrong here. A Non-confirmable request can *not* get an Acknowledgement message, and therefore can *not* get a piggy-backed response. Additionally, the response MAY be Confirmable or MAY be Non-confirmable, though certainly Non-Confirmable is the more likely case. This should probably be reworded.<br><br><br>3:<br><br>&nbsp;  Token Length (TKL):&nbsp; 4-bit unsigned integer.&nbsp; Indicates the length of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the variable-length Token field (0-8 bytes).&nbsp; Lengths 9-15 are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reserved, MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be processed as a message<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; format error.<br><br>Why not make TKL a 3-bit unsigned integer and have a reserved padding bit before it?

It would also make the registry much easier to read.<br><br>4.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A Confirmable message<br>&nbsp;  always carries either a request or response and MUST NOT be empty,<br>&nbsp;  unless it is used only to elicit a Reset message.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't understand the requirement not to be empty, especially when there is an exception at the end of the sentence.

Aren't those the only two options?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Reset message MUST echo the Message ID of the<br>&nbsp;  Confirmable message, and MUST be empty.<br><br>Why MUST a Reset be empty? What harm is there if there is data in there?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Rejecting an Acknowledgement<br>&nbsp;  or Reset message is effected by silently ignoring it.<br><br>I don't understand the above. As far as I can tell, an Acknowledgement nor a Reset can be rejected; the side that sent them will never know it is rejected.<br>&nbsp;  <br>4.5: All of the MUSTs and MAYs in the section are used rather terribly. I'm glad to suggest text if you need.<br><br>4.6: The phrase "and (by fitting into one UDP payload) obviously MUST fit within a single IP datagram" is unnecessary, but even if you do use it, s/MUST/needs to. The MUST is not a requirement on an implementation of CoAP. That said, I fear this section is really nothing more than an implementation note: Because it is a layer violation, it's not clear to me that any implementer has the ability to figure out much of this. (For example, the idea that an implementer would be willing to -- or even know how to -- set the Do Not Fragment bit or figure out the Path MTU is a bit hopeful.) I have no objection to this section, but it might be better as an implementation note rather than a set of requirements.<br><br>5.2: I found "indicating a value of 4*32+3, hexadecimal 0x83 or decimal 131" just adds confusion rather than clarify. Perhaps instead: "even though if taken as an 8-bit unsigned, the entire Response Code field would have a value of hexadecimal 0x83 or decimal 131 (4*32+3)". But personally, I would simply drop it; it doesn't add anything. See also comments above on section 3 and below on 12.1.<br><br>Also:<br><br>&nbsp;  The response codes are designed to be extensible: Response Codes in<br>&nbsp;  the Client Error and Server Error class that are unrecognized by an<br>&nbsp;  endpoint MUST be treated as being equivalent to the generic Response<br>&nbsp;  Code of that class (4.00 and 5.00, respectively).&nbsp; However, there is<br>&nbsp;  no generic Response Code indicating success, so a Response Code in<br>&nbsp;  the Success class that is unrecognized by an endpoint can only be<br>&nbsp;  used to determine that the request was successful without any further<br>&nbsp;  details.<br>&nbsp;  <br>First, I suggest changing the first sentence after the colon: "Response Code details that are unrecognized by an endpoint when the class is Client Error or Server Error&nbsp; are treated as equivalent to the...". Much clearer, and the MUST is wrong. Second, I don't see why you don't simply define a 2.00 so that this can be a bunch simpler.<br><br>5.2.3: Potential confusion: s/the client may send a Resent message/the client will send a Resent message<br><br>5.4.1: I don't understand the need for the third bullet. Isn't this already said in the second bullet? The fourth bullet has the same issue as 2.1 and 4.3.<br><br>5.4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  If the option is not present, the default<br>&nbsp;  value MUST be assumed.<br><br>Don't you really mean, "If an option is present with no value, the value is the default."? The way you have it written sounds like a completely missing option should be assumed to be present and have a default value. I don't think that's what you mean. (The MUST is just superfluous anyway.)<br><br>5.4.5:<br><br>&nbsp;  If a message includes an option with more occurrences than the option<br>&nbsp;  is defined for, the additional option occurrences MUST be treated<br>&nbsp;  like an unrecognized option (see Section 5.4.1).<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think you want to be specific about the order:<br><br>&nbsp;  If a message includes an option with more occurrences than the option<br>&nbsp;  is defined for, any additional option occurrences that appear<br>&nbsp;  subsequently in the message MUST be treated like an unrecognized<br>&nbsp;  option (see Section 5.4.1).<br><br>That is to say, you can't choose to keep later ones and discard earlier ones.<br><br>5.4.6: If it were me, I would have put the NoCacheKey bits in the high four bits so that you could simply do a &lt;224 test for cache-matching options. I suppose this ship has sailed.<br><br>5.5.1: The implementation note notwithstanding, I don't understand why Content-Format is not a SHOULD.<br><br>5.7.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  If a response is generated out of a cache, it MUST be generated with<br>&nbsp;  a Max-Age Option that does not extend the max-age originally set by<br>&nbsp;  the server<br><br>The reverse would be clearer:<br><br>&nbsp;  If a response is generated out of a cache, the generated Max-Age<br>&nbsp;  Option MUST NOT extend the max-age originally set by the server<br>&nbsp;  <br>Also: "a proxy SHOULD be conservative" s/SHOULD/should. There's nothing to implement here.<br><br>5.10.5 s/MUST/is. The MUST is not meaningful.<br><br>8.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  A server SHOULD be aware that a request arrived via multicast, e.g.<br>&nbsp;  by making use of modern APIs such as IPV6_RECVPKTINFO [<a href="/doc/rfc3542/">RFC3542</a>], if<br>&nbsp;  available.<br><br>That SHOULD is not meaningful. It is useful, not required with exceptions (as SHOULD indicates), for the server to know that it is using multicast.<br><br>This also gives a reason not to allow RST on *any* NON messages.<br><br>8.2: "the server MAY always pretend"? We are getting sillier with our 2119 usage later in the document. Did you really mean, "the server MAY ignore the request"? Isn't that true of any NON request, not just multicast ones?<br><br>(I did not do an significant review of sections 9 or 11.)<br><br>12.1: As mentioned regarding section 3 and 5.2 above, I think it would be much easier to figure these out if you separated out the bit fields of code type and code, and then had sub-registries for request codes, success codes, client error codes, and server error codes.</div></td>
