 In what way is exposing the full contents of a zone a privacy risk?<br><br>Brainstorming, in split-DNS scenarios the contents of the "internal"<br>zone might only be intended for authenticated+authorized users, and<br>leaking it would provide reconaissance into the internal network.<br><br>&nbsp;  hard to enumerate an DNSSEC signed zone as an unsigned zone).&nbsp; Whilst<br>&nbsp;  this is widely used, zone walking is now possible with NSEC3 due to<br>&nbsp;  crypto-breaking advances.&nbsp; This has prompted further work on an<br>&nbsp;  alternative mechanism for DNSSEC authenticated denial of existence -<br>&nbsp;  NSEC5 [<a href="/doc/draft-vcelak-nsec5/">I-D.vcelak-nsec5</a>] - however questions remain over the<br>&nbsp;  practicality of this mechanism.<br><br>Do we want to consider direct reference(s) for "crypto-breaking<br>advances" instead of leaving a layer of indirection through the nsec5<br>draft?<br><br>I would also strongly suggest demystifying the NSEC3 zone-walking<br>mechanism and not suggesting that there has been a magic break against<br>cryptographic hashes.&nbsp; If I understand correctly, a mechanism roughly<br>analogous to the classical NSEC-walking mechanism is used to enumerate<br>the hash intervals in the zone, and then a standard brute-forcing<br>mechanism is applied to the hash values, facilitated by knowledge of the<br>structure of domain names (and optionally the statistical distribution<br>of domain names as well).&nbsp; So this might instead become:<br><br>&gt; Whilst this is widely used, zone walking is also possible with NSEC3.<br>&gt; The initial procedure finds the hashed forms of the names in the zone,<br>&gt; and using the known properties and distributions of domain names,<br>&gt; brute-force attacks to recover the un-hashed names are feasible.&nbsp; This<br>&gt; has prompted further work [...]<br><br>&nbsp;  transfers using ACLs and TSIG in more detail.&nbsp; It also discusses the<br>&nbsp;  possibility that specific deployments might choose to use a lower<br>&nbsp;  level network layer to protect zone transfers, e.g., IPSec.<br><br>I think the wording might be off, here, perhaps s/lower level network<br>layer/lower level security layer/?<br><br>&nbsp;  Because both AXFR and IXFR zone transfers are typically carried out<br>&nbsp;  over TCP from authoritative DNS protocol implementations, encrypting<br>&nbsp;  zone transfers using TLS, based closely on DoT [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>], seems like<br>&nbsp;  a simple step forward.&nbsp; This document specifies how to use TLS (1.3<br>&nbsp;  or later) as a transport to prevent zone collection from zone<br>&nbsp;  transfers.<br><br>This seems to be the first standalone mention of TLS, so an <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a><br>reference is probably appropriate.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Please use the boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a> verbatim (it does not have an<br>"and" between [<a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC8174</a>], at least).<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Current usage of TCP for IXFR is sub-optimal in some cases i.e.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  connections are frequently closed after a single IXFR.<br><br>Perhaps say something about how XoT is an opportunity to improve<br>performance by providing different guidance, as was done for the<br>"backwards compatibility" sub-bullet?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the SOA of the published zone can be trivially discovered by<br>&nbsp;  simply querying the publicly available authoritative servers leakage<br>&nbsp;  of this RR is not discussed in the following sections.<br><br>It seems it *is* discussed, though, in the context of hidden primaries or<br>secondaries (which is qualitatively different from "the published zone"<br>and thus not quite in conflict with the first part of the claim).<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; remove any need for XoT implementations to support legacy behavior<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that XFR-over-TCP implementations have historically often<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supported<br><br>I'm not sure I follow the reasoning for "remove any need".&nbsp; If an<br>authoritative resolver implementation that supports XoT also needs to<br>talk to any non-XoT-supporting primary or secondary, it seems like it<br>may still need that legacy behavior.&nbsp; I see how an XoT-only<br>implementation can divest the legacy baggage, but don't think we can get<br>to assuming XoT-only in a single step.<br><br>Section 7.x<br><br>Is it possible to give clarity about which sections or which behaviors<br>are being updated in these respective subsections?<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  zones).&nbsp; The response streams for concurrent AXFRs MAY be<br>&nbsp;  intermingled and AXFR-over-TCP clients compliant with this<br>&nbsp;  specification which pipeline AXFR requests MUST be able to handle<br>&nbsp;  this.<br><br>Should we say anything about the demultiplexing strategy here (DNS<br>header message ID?)?<br><br>Section 7.3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; pipeline such requests (if they pipeline XFR requests in general)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and MAY intermingle them<br><br>I don't think I understand what it means to intermingle *requests* (vs<br>responses).&nbsp; Is this defined somewhere that could be referenced?<br><br>Section 7.3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Certain legacy behaviors were noted in [<a href="/doc/rfc5936/">RFC5936</a>], with provisions<br>&nbsp;  that implementations may want to offer options to fallback to legacy<br>&nbsp;  behavior when interoperating with servers known not to support<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5936/">RFC5936</a>].&nbsp; For purposes of interoperability, IXFR and AXFR<br>&nbsp;  implementations may want to continue offering such configuration<br>&nbsp;  options, as well as supporting some behaviors that were<br>&nbsp;  underspecified prior to this work (e.g., performing IXFR and AXFRs on<br>&nbsp;  separate connections).&nbsp; However, XoT implementations should have no<br>&nbsp;  need to do so.<br><br>Similarly to my remark on Section 7, does this only hold for "XoT-only<br>implementations"?<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>Just to check my understanding, these updates to <a href="/doc/rfc7766/">RFC 7766</a> apply for all<br>cases, not just XFR (in contrast to the Section 7.3 updates, which only<br>apply for XFR scenarios)?&nbsp; I wonder if this could be emphasized somehow<br>(as well as that these updates apply for regular DNS over TCP, not just<br>DoT), though I don't have any ideas at the moment.<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  For improved security all implementations of this specification MUST<br>&nbsp;  use only TLS 1.3 [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>] or later.<br><br>(nit) improved over what baseline?<br>Perhaps "In order to provide the highest level of security protections"?<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>(nit) is there some reason why the SOA request/response exchange could<br>not be done on an unencrypted TCP connection (not that there would be<br>much reason to do so if TCP/TLS is to be used for the actual XFR)?<br><br>Section 8.7<br><br>&nbsp;  error or fallback path when queries were refused.&nbsp; As a result the<br>&nbsp;  client behavior could vary significantly.&nbsp; XoT servers that refuse<br>&nbsp;  queries must cater for the fact that client behavior might vary from<br>&nbsp;  continually retrying queries regardless of receiving REFUSED to every<br>&nbsp;  query, or at the other extreme clients may decide to stop using the<br>&nbsp;  server over any transport.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This (non-normative) requirement seems vague and unactionable.&nbsp; Can we<br>give any more precise guidance on when the SHOULD from the previous can<br>be ignored?<br>(We might also clarify that the EDE code 21 is (likely?) to accompany a<br>REFUSED RCODE, since we only mention REFUSED in this paragraph.)<br><br>Section 8.8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the re-use of XoT connections for transfers of multiple<br>&nbsp;  different zones complicates any attempt to analyze the traffic size<br>&nbsp;  and timing to extract information.<br><br>I might try to hedge this statement a bit.&nbsp; While it is technically true<br>that analyzing the combined transfer is more complicated than analyzing<br>individual transfers in isolation, past experience in traffic analysis<br>(combined with the ability to query the live serial numbers of the<br>domains being served) suggests that the additional burden on the<br>attacker is not very large.<br><br>Section 8.9.3<br><br>I'd suggest mentioning the possibility that a client will have to send<br>dummy IXFR requests in order to achieve the strongest level of<br>obfuscation (thus triggering dummy responses that do not correspond to<br>actual zone updates).&nbsp; I don't have a great sense for how many ways such<br>dummy requests can be formed (is just asking for a repeat of the<br>previously requested delta going to work?) or whether it is worth<br>emphasizing that servers will need to be prepared to handle such<br>requests, though.<br><br>We don't need to specify the actual mechanism here, just raise awareness<br>that some mechanism might be used/defined in the future.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>The way we describe two potential options for policy on secondaries for<br>selecting which primary to request XFR from risks running afoul of the<br><a href="/doc/rfc7127/">RFC 7127</a> characterization that proposed standards have "resolved known<br>design choices".<br><br>I am choosing to not ballot Discuss on this topic because the scenario<br>is predicated on there existing a multi-primary configuration, which<br>suggests that any server that is primary is authorized to be a source of<br>the data, and thus that there is not supposed to be a difference in end<br>result regardless of which primary is selected.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>In the vein of my discuss point, it's not entirely clear whether it's<br>more important to focus on client authentication or client<br>authorization.&nbsp; TSIG and SIG(0) seem to be better modeled as<br>authorization mechanisms than authentication ones (in addition to<br>providing DO as already indicated), and considering the questino of<br>authorization to initiate XFR may be more relevant to operational needs<br>than specifically authentication of the client (which is just going to<br>be used as input to an ACL that performs an authorization check).<br><br>Section 12<br><br>&nbsp;  Within any transfer group both AXFRs and IXFRs for a zone MUST all<br>&nbsp;  use the same policy, e.g., if AXFRs use AXoT then all IXFRs MUST use<br>&nbsp;  IXoT.<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to assure the confidentiality of the zone information, the<br>&nbsp;  entire transfer group MUST have a consistent policy of requiring<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality.&nbsp; If any do not, this is a weak link for attackers to<br>&nbsp;  exploit.<br><br>These two requirements seem to be at least partially redundant.&nbsp; It's<br>also not entirely clear to me how useful it is to preclude the<br>possibility of a mixed environment where all the protocols used provide<br>equivalent levesl of confidentiality protection.&nbsp; (The latter<br>requirement on protecting confidentiality does not preclude this<br>possibility, to be clear, just the example policy of "MUST use XoT".)<br><br>&nbsp;  A XoT policy should specify<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; What kind of TLS is required (Strict or Mutual TLS)<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; or if an IP based ACL is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; (optionally) if TSIG/SIG(0) is required<br><br>I'm not sure this is a clear way to spell the required behavior.&nbsp; In<br>particular, my understanding is that strict TLS is always required, plus<br>at least one of TLS client authentication (for mutual TLS) or IP ACL.<br>The rest of the document suggests that TSIG/SIG(0) is an orthogonal<br>axis, but my understanding is that TSIG/SIG(0), as cryptographic<br>mechanisms, would be preferred over the IP ACL, and in fact that they<br>would fill the roll well enough to be able to serve as a third option<br>alongside TLS client authentication and IP ACL.&nbsp; I understand that some<br>changes to the exposition in this area are in preparation based on the<br>feedback already received from Martin D, John, and Roman, and may have<br>further comments when the updated text is available.<br><br>&nbsp;  Certain aspects of the Policies can be relatively easily tested<br>&nbsp;  independently, e.g., by requesting zone transfers without TSIG, from<br>&nbsp;  unauthorized IP addresses or over cleartext DNS.&nbsp; Other aspects such<br>&nbsp;  as if a secondary will accept data without a TSIG digest or if<br>&nbsp;  secondaries are using Strict as opposed to Opportunistic TLS are more<br>&nbsp;  challenging.<br><br>(Pedantically, I don't think it would be very hard to acquire a<br>certificate+private key that could be used to produce a TLS connection<br>that would succeed if the secondary is using opportunistic TLS and fail<br>under strict TLS -- a self-signed certificate not expected to be trusted<br>would likely suffice.&nbsp; That said, I don't dispute the "more challenging"<br>characterization, since the operational consequences of actually using<br>that mechanism to test the behavior of the secondary could be<br>significant.)<br><br>Section 14<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about a hidden primary setup where the<br>primary serves only XFR and not regular queries?&nbsp; Off the top of my<br>head it might allow for enforcing the IP ACL sooner, before an actual<br>XFR request is seen, but I expect that my insight is not the most useful<br>contribution in this space.&nbsp; Similarly, such a hidden primary might<br>reject all non-TLS connections, etc.<br><br>Section 16<br><br>&nbsp;  Both items 1. and 2.2. listed above require the client (secondary) to<br>&nbsp;  authenticate the server (primary) using a configured authentication<br>&nbsp;  domain name if XoT is used.<br><br>I recognize that this section is to be removed for publication, but<br>knowing what is used as the X.509 trust store along with the configured<br>authentication domain name would be interesting.<br><br>Section 21.2<br><br>Though <a href="/doc/rfc2931/">RFC 2931</a> is not referenced in many places, the prose does have<br>some MAY-level guidance to use TSIG and SIG(0) as providing equivalent<br>protection, so I think that <a href="/doc/rfc2931/">RFC 2931</a> should be classified as normative<br>just as <a href="/doc/rfc8945/">RFC 8945</a> is.&nbsp; (It's a proposed standard so there is no downref<br>issue.)<br><br>I guess that <a href="/doc/rfc6891/">RFC 6891</a> is going to be transatively normative by way of<br>Extended DNS Errors and <a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC 7828</a>, but I'm not going to insist that it be<br>classified directly as normative here.<br><br>Section A.3<br><br>I'm extremely reluctant to suggest using SNI in this manner (as an<br>impromptu authorization bearer token, akin to port knocking).&nbsp; At a<br>protocol level it would be just as easy to configure the use of TLS with<br>pre-shared key, that would provide real security.&nbsp; Note that as of <a href="/doc/rfc8773/">RFC<br>8773</a> it is permitted to use a PSK and certificate authentication in<br>combination, so use of PSK in this manner would not (again, at the<br>protocol level) impede security.&nbsp; Implementation support is probably<br>lacking on this front, but that's no different than the currently<br>described mechanism...<br><br>Because this topic relates to TLS usage, I have started an email thread<br>with the TLS WG for it:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ZIPo1mF_wnOXkgS7Uv_wzIBFmR8/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ZIPo1mF_wnOXkgS7Uv_wzIBFmR8/</a><br><br>The tentative recommendation so far is in rough agreement with my<br>instincts, and suggest removing the entire appendix.<br><br>Section A.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Some primaries might rely on TSIG/SIG(0) combined with per-query IP<br>&nbsp;  based ACLs to authenticate secondaries.&nbsp; In this case the primary<br>&nbsp;  must accept all incoming TLS connections and then apply a TLS<br>&nbsp;  specific response policy on a per query basis.<br><br>(nit) Is this actually necessarily a "TLS-specific" response policy?<br>IIUC essentially the same procedures apply today for DNS-over-TCP XFR.<br><br>&nbsp;  Cons: The server must handle the burden of accepting all TLS<br>&nbsp;  connections just to perform XFRs with a small number of secondaries.<br>&nbsp;  Client behavior to REFUSED response is not clearly defined (see<br>&nbsp;  below).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(nit) Is this still "below"?&nbsp; I recall discussion of this up in §8.7 and<br>there's not much left in the document...<br><br>Section A.4.1<br><br>(Similar concerns as for A.3, above, apply to this (ab)use of SNI.<br>I expect there are other superior mechanisms here, as well, though did<br>not think about it much.&nbsp; Even defining a new TLS extension (the policy<br>is only "specification required") would be an improvement (though still<br>not provide very solid security properties).</div></td>

 Because both AXFR and IXFR zone transfers are typically carried out<br>&nbsp;  over TCP from authoritative DNS protocol implementations, encrypting<br>&nbsp;  zone transfers using TLS, based closely on DoT [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>], seems like<br>&nbsp;  a simple step forward.&nbsp; This document specifies how to use TLS (1.3<br>&nbsp;  or later) as a transport to prevent zone collection from zone<br>&nbsp;  transfers.<br><br>This seems to be the first standalone mention of TLS, so an <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a><br>reference is probably appropriate.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Please use the boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a> verbatim (it does not have an<br>"and" between [<a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC8174</a>], at least).<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

While it is technically true<br>that analyzing the combined transfer is more complicated than analyzing<br>individual transfers in isolation, past experience in traffic analysis<br>(combined with the ability to query the live serial numbers of the<br>domains being served) suggests that the additional burden on the<br>attacker is not very large.<br><br>Section 8.9.3<br><br>I'd suggest mentioning the possibility that a client will have to send<br>dummy IXFR requests in order to achieve the strongest level of<br>obfuscation (thus triggering dummy responses that do not correspond to<br>actual zone updates).&nbsp; I don't have a great sense for how many ways such<br>dummy requests can be formed (is just asking for a repeat of the<br>previously requested delta going to work?) or whether it is worth<br>emphasizing that servers will need to be prepared to handle such<br>requests, though.<br><br>We don't need to specify the actual mechanism here, just raise awareness<br>that some mechanism might be used/defined in the future.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>The way we describe two potential options for policy on secondaries for<br>selecting which primary to request XFR from risks running afoul of the<br><a href="/doc/rfc7127/">RFC 7127</a> characterization that proposed standards have "resolved known<br>design choices".<br><br>I am choosing to not ballot Discuss on this topic because the scenario<br>is predicated on there existing a multi-primary configuration, which<br>suggests that any server that is primary is authorized to be a source of<br>the data, and thus that there is not supposed to be a difference in end<br>result regardless of which primary is selected.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>In the vein of my discuss point, it's not entirely clear whether it's<br>more important to focus on client authentication or client<br>authorization.&nbsp; TSIG and SIG(0) seem to be better modeled as<br>authorization mechanisms than authentication ones (in addition to<br>providing DO as already indicated), and considering the questino of<br>authorization to initiate XFR may be more relevant to operational needs<br>than specifically authentication of the client (which is just going to<br>be used as input to an ACL that performs an authorization check).<br><br>Section 12<br><br>&nbsp;  Within any transfer group both AXFRs and IXFRs for a zone MUST all<br>&nbsp;  use the same policy, e.g., if AXFRs use AXoT then all IXFRs MUST use<br>&nbsp;  IXoT.<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to assure the confidentiality of the zone information, the<br>&nbsp;  entire transfer group MUST have a consistent policy of requiring<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality.&nbsp; If any do not, this is a weak link for attackers to<br>&nbsp;  exploit.<br><br>These two requirements seem to be at least partially redundant.&nbsp; It's<br>also not entirely clear to me how useful it is to preclude the<br>possibility of a mixed environment where all the protocols used provide<br>equivalent levesl of confidentiality protection.&nbsp; (The latter<br>requirement on protecting confidentiality does not preclude this<br>possibility, to be clear, just the example policy of "MUST use XoT".)<br><br>&nbsp;  A XoT policy should specify<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; What kind of TLS is required (Strict or Mutual TLS)<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; or if an IP based ACL is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; (optionally) if TSIG/SIG(0) is required<br><br>I'm not sure this is a clear way to spell the required behavior.&nbsp; In<br>particular, my understanding is that strict TLS is always required, plus<br>at least one of TLS client authentication (for mutual TLS) or IP ACL.<br>The rest of the document suggests that TSIG/SIG(0) is an orthogonal<br>axis, but my understanding is that TSIG/SIG(0), as cryptographic<br>mechanisms, would be preferred over the IP ACL, and in fact that they<br>would fill the roll well enough to be able to serve as a third option<br>alongside TLS client authentication and IP ACL.&nbsp; I understand that some<br>changes to the exposition in this area are in preparation based on the<br>feedback already received from Martin D, John, and Roman, and may have<br>further comments when the updated text is available.<br><br>&nbsp;  Certain aspects of the Policies can be relatively easily tested<br>&nbsp;  independently, e.g., by requesting zone transfers without TSIG, from<br>&nbsp;  unauthorized IP addresses or over cleartext DNS.&nbsp; Other aspects such<br>&nbsp;  as if a secondary will accept data without a TSIG digest or if<br>&nbsp;  secondaries are using Strict as opposed to Opportunistic TLS are more<br>&nbsp;  challenging.<br><br>(Pedantically, I don't think it would be very hard to acquire a<br>certificate+private key that could be used to produce a TLS connection<br>that would succeed if the secondary is using opportunistic TLS and fail<br>under strict TLS -- a self-signed certificate not expected to be trusted<br>would likely suffice.&nbsp; That said, I don't dispute the "more challenging"<br>characterization, since the operational consequences of actually using<br>that mechanism to test the behavior of the secondary could be<br>significant.)<br><br>Section 14<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about a hidden primary setup where the<br>primary serves only XFR and not regular queries?&nbsp; Off the top of my<br>head it might allow for enforcing the IP ACL sooner, before an actual<br>XFR request is seen, but I expect that my insight is not the most useful<br>contribution in this space.&nbsp; Similarly, such a hidden primary might<br>reject all non-TLS connections, etc.<br><br>Section 16<br><br>&nbsp;  Both items 1. and 2.2. listed above require the client (secondary) to<br>&nbsp;  authenticate the server (primary) using a configured authentication<br>&nbsp;  domain name if XoT is used.<br><br>I recognize that this section is to be removed for publication, but<br>knowing what is used as the X.509 trust store along with the configured<br>authentication domain name would be interesting.<br><br>Section 21.2<br><br>Though <a href="/doc/rfc2931/">RFC 2931</a> is not referenced in many places, the prose does have<br>some MAY-level guidance to use TSIG and SIG(0) as providing equivalent<br>protection, so I think that <a href="/doc/rfc2931/">RFC 2931</a> should be classified as normative<br>just as <a href="/doc/rfc8945/">RFC 8945</a> is.&nbsp; (It's a proposed standard so there is no downref<br>issue.)<br><br>I guess that <a href="/doc/rfc6891/">RFC 6891</a> is going to be transatively normative by way of<br>Extended DNS Errors and <a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC 7828</a>, but I'm not going to insist that it be<br>classified directly as normative here.<br><br>Section A.3<br><br>I'm extremely reluctant to suggest using SNI in this manner (as an<br>impromptu authorization bearer token, akin to port knocking).&nbsp; At a<br>protocol level it would be just as easy to configure the use of TLS with<br>pre-shared key, that would provide real security.&nbsp; Note that as of <a href="/doc/rfc8773/">RFC<br>8773</a> it is permitted to use a PSK and certificate authentication in<br>combination, so use of PSK in this manner would not (again, at the<br>protocol level) impede security.&nbsp; Implementation support is probably<br>lacking on this front, but that's no different than the currently<br>described mechanism...<br><br>Because this topic relates to TLS usage, I have started an email thread<br>with the TLS WG for it:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ZIPo1mF_wnOXkgS7Uv_wzIBFmR8/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ZIPo1mF_wnOXkgS7Uv_wzIBFmR8/</a><br><br>The tentative recommendation so far is in rough agreement with my<br>instincts, and suggest removing the entire appendix.<br><br>Section A.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Some primaries might rely on TSIG/SIG(0) combined with per-query IP<br>&nbsp;  based ACLs to authenticate secondaries.&nbsp; In this case the primary<br>&nbsp;  must accept all incoming TLS connections and then apply a TLS<br>&nbsp;  specific response policy on a per query basis.<br><br>(nit) Is this actually necessarily a "TLS-specific" response policy?<br>IIUC essentially the same procedures apply today for DNS-over-TCP XFR.<br><br>&nbsp;  Cons: The server must handle the burden of accepting all TLS<br>&nbsp;  connections just to perform XFRs with a small number of secondaries.<br>&nbsp;  Client behavior to REFUSED response is not clearly defined (see<br>&nbsp;  below).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(nit) Is this still "below"?&nbsp; I recall discussion of this up in §8.7 and<br>there's not much left in the document...<br><br>Section A.4.1<br><br>(Similar concerns as for A.3, above, apply to this (ab)use of SNI.<br>I expect there are other superior mechanisms here, as well, though did<br>not think about it much.&nbsp; Even defining a new TLS extension (the policy<br>is only "specification required") would be an improvement (though still<br>not provide very solid security properties).</div></td>
