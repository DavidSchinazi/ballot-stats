This is<br>&nbsp;  because AS3's decision policy permits giving priority to a shorter<br>&nbsp;  route to prefix P1 via a lateral peer (AS2) over a longer route<br>&nbsp;  learned directly from the customer (AS1).&nbsp; In such a scenario, AS3<br>&nbsp;  would not send any route announcement for prefix P1 to AS2 (over the<br><br>I expect this is just my lack of familiarity here, but does the decision<br>policy "giving priority" to shorter routes vs customer routes mean that<br>it won't propagate the customer advertisement at all or just that it<br>won't route traffic that way?<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;

However, those operators are not the only people reviewing this document.&nbsp; A short explanation or reference would be nice.<br><br>(5) Please use the <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">rfc8174</a> template.<br><br>(6) [For the AD/Shepherd.] I'm assuming that the intent is for this document to be part of <a href="/doc/bcp84/">BCP 84</a>, is that correct?&nbsp; I'm not sure how to let the RFC Editor know that is the intent, but it should be made clear somewhere.</div></td>

This is indicated in the header.\<br>\<br>BCP is appropriate. The document compares the effectiveness of various current techniques of reverse path filtering and presents an additional, enhanced technique.&nbsp; The current techniques are expressed in <a href="/doc/rfc2827/">RFC2827</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc3704/">RFC3704</a>, both themselves BCP.&nbsp; The presented technique is an enhancement of a technique specified in <a href="/doc/rfc3704/">RFC3704</a>.&nbsp; The document updates <a href="/doc/rfc3704/">RFC3704</a>.\cf0 \<br>\<br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement\<br>Write-Up.

The strict\<br>&nbsp;  uRPF technique is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF\<br>&nbsp;  technique is oblivious to directionality, and the current\<br>&nbsp;  feasible-path uRPF technique attempts to strike a balance between the\<br>&nbsp;  two (see <a href="/doc/bcp84/">BCP 84</a>). However, as shown in this draft, the existing\<br>&nbsp;  feasible-path uRPF technique still has shortcomings. This document\<br>&nbsp;  describes an enhanced feasible-path uRPF technique, which aims to be\<br>&nbsp;  more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the\<br>&nbsp;  feasible-path uRPF technique. It can potentially alleviate ISPs'\<br>&nbsp;  concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their\<br>&nbsp;  customers, and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques..\cf0 \<br>\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \<br>\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0<br>\cf0 Working Group Summary\<br>\<br>\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0<br>\cf2&nbsp;  The document was discussed in grow and in opsec, and adopted by opsec.&nbsp; Discussions\<br>&nbsp; in both working groups were incorporated into the document.\cf0 \<br>\<br>Document Quality\<br>\<br>\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0<br>\cf0 Are there existing implementations of the protocol?
