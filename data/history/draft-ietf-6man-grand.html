 return traffic flow.&nbsp; While waiting for the resolution to complete<br>&nbsp;  routers only keep a very small number of packets in the queue, as<br>&nbsp;  recommended in Section 7.2.2 [<a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>].&nbsp; All subsequent packets<br>&nbsp;  arriving before the resolution process finishes are likely to be<br>&nbsp;  dropped.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>My reading of <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC 4861</a> is that it suggests for new packets arriving to<br>replace the oldest entry in this queue of packets, which doesn't really<br>seem consistent with "all subsequent packets [...] are likely to be<br>dropped".&nbsp; "Any additional packets arriving before the resolution<br>process finishes are likely to result in dropped packets" might be more<br>consistent with the <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC 4861</a> guidance.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As per Section 7.2.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Routers MUST buffer at least one data packet and MAY buffer more,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  while resolving the packet destination address.&nbsp; However most<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  router implementations limit the buffer size to a few packets<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  only, so all subsequent packets for the host global address are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dropped, until the address resolution process is completed.<br><br>[same as above re "subsequent"]<br><br>&nbsp;  router's neighbor cache.&nbsp; However, the same sequence of events happen<br>&nbsp;  when the host starts using a new global address previously unseen by<br>&nbsp;  the router, such as a new privacy address [<a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC4941</a>] or if the<br>&nbsp;  router's Neighbor Cache has been flushed.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC 4941</a> has been obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc8981/">RFC 8981</a>.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the router does not have a Neighbor Cache entry for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address, a STALE entry needs to be created.<br><br>(editorial) The lead-in to this list leaves me unclear about when it's<br>desired for this entry to be created.&nbsp; The conditional nature of this<br>statement suggests that creating as a result of receiving the first<br>packet for that address might be okay, but I don't think that's actually<br>the intent.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To minimize the potential disruption in case of duplicate addresses<br>&nbsp;  the node should not set the Override flag for a preferred address and<br>&nbsp;  must not set the Override flag if the address is in Optimistic<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4429/">RFC4429</a>] state.<br><br>I suggest adding "preferred address" to the terminology list (with <a href="/doc/rfc4862/">RFC<br>4862</a> reference).<br><br>&nbsp;  It should be noted that the proposed mechanism does not cause any<br>&nbsp;  significant increase in multicast traffic.&nbsp; The additional multicast<br>&nbsp;  unsolicited NA would proactively create a STALE cache entry on<br>&nbsp;  routers as discussed below.&nbsp; When the router receives the return<br>&nbsp;  traffic flows it does not need to send multicast NSes to the<br>&nbsp;  solicited node multicast address but would be sending unicast NSes<br>&nbsp;  instead.&nbsp; Therefore the total amount of multicast traffic should not<br>&nbsp;  increase.<br><br>Hmm, I might frame this as "this procedure would only produce an<br>increase in the overall amount of multicast traffic if no return traffic<br>arrives to the node that sent the unsolicited NA".<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This document updates [<a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>] so that routers create a new Neighbor<br>&nbsp;  Cache entry upon receiving an unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement.<br><br>I'd suggest "upon receiving an unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement for an<br>address that does not already have a Neighbor Cache entry".<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  However most likely those packets would have been dropped anyway:<br>&nbsp;  creating the INCOMPLETE entry is usually triggered by traffic, so the<br>&nbsp;  router probably has some packets in the buffer already, dropping<br>&nbsp;  subsequent packets received before the address resolution is<br>&nbsp;  completed.<br><br>I *think* the packet-dropping scenario here is the same one that I<br>mentioned previously in the context of "subsequent packets" (not) being<br>dropped, involving the very small queue on the router of packets to an<br>address waiting for resolution.&nbsp; If so, I might suggest a phrasing such<br>as "the creation of the INCOMPLETE entry is usually triggered by inbound<br>traffic, and due to the limited queue size on the router for packets<br>directed to addresses that are waiting for resolution, most packets<br>arriving prior to the solicited NA would be dropped anyway".<br><br>Section 5.3.1<br><br>As a thought experiment, I tried comparing this scenario to a similar<br>one where the host uses optimistic DAD but does not send an unsolicited<br>NA.&nbsp; In that case, it seems like the optimistic traffic would go out,<br>and when the return traffic arrives the router would create a STALE<br>entry and do full discovery to find the original owner of the address,<br>so some of the responses to the optimistic (probe) traffic might make it<br>to the original owner of the address.&nbsp; That's in contrast to this<br>scenario where the return traffic goes to the host that triggered it.<br>IIUC in both cases we rely on the host properly doing DAD to stop using<br>the optimistic address, and so the scenarios do seem pretty similar<br>overall.<br><br>Section 6.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  NEW TEXT:<br><br>&nbsp;  ------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>&nbsp;  When a valid Neighbor Advertisement is received (either solicited or<br>&nbsp;  unsolicited), the Neighbor Cache is searched for the target's entry.<br>&nbsp;  If no entry exists, hosts SHOULD silently discard the advertisement.<br>&nbsp;  There is no need to create an entry if none exists, since the<br>&nbsp;  recipient has apparently not initiated any communication with the<br>&nbsp;  target.&nbsp; Routers SHOULD create a new entry for the target address<br>&nbsp;  with the link-layer address set to the Target link-layer address<br>&nbsp;  option (if supplied).&nbsp; The entry's reachability state MUST also be<br>&nbsp;  set to STALE.&nbsp; If the received Neighbor Advertisement does not<br>&nbsp;  contain the Target link-layer address option the advertisement SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  be silently discarded.<br><br>(nit) I'm not sure why we need the word "also" in "MUST also be set to<br>STALE".<br><br>Section 10<br><br>I'd probably reiterate the (small) risk of the 7-second window of loss<br>of traffic discussed in §5.3.2 as a known+accepted security<br>consideration.<br><br>&nbsp;  A malicious host could attempt to exhaust the neighbor cache on the<br>&nbsp;  router by creating a large number of STALE entries.&nbsp; However this<br>&nbsp;  attack vector is not new and this document does not increase the risk<br>&nbsp;  of such an attack: the attacker could do it, for example, by sending<br>&nbsp;  a NS or RS packet with SLLAO included.&nbsp; All recommendations from<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6583/">RFC6583</a>] still apply.<br><br>Would there be any value in having the neighbor cache entries created on<br>routers by unsolicited NA be placed in a dedicated storage class, such<br>that the NDP prioritization recommended by <a href="/doc/rfc6583/">RFC 6583</a> would be expanded to<br>include "never seen", "unsolicited NA", and "seen before" categories<br>with corresponding eviction priorities?<br><br>Section 12.1<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6775/">RFC 6775</a> and 8505 probably don't need to be normative, since the<br>registration-based approach to ND is the approach not taken by this<br>document.<br><br>We also only cite <a href="/doc/rfc8305/">RFC 8305</a> once, just as an example, so that may not<br>need to be normative either.</div></td>

I would assume link-layer would be enough (no need to do NUD at the beginning ?)<br><br>In the description, should the "host" rather be a "node" (i.e., possibly having a router role) ?<br><br>Should "If the host sends multiple probes in parallel" be more detailed by adding "to multiple destinations" ?<br><br>-- Section 4.1 --<br>The amount of mcast traffic is even reduced in the sense that less nodes are receiving the NA/NS traffic (in this I-D only routers else all nodes).<br><br>-- Section 5.2 --<br>Humm I do not fully agree with the last part of the section "However most likely those packets...address resolution is completed.". The optimistic DAD node will indeed receive the already-queued packets so I do to really understand the part "dropping subsequent packets" as those packets would have been dropped anyway. Nothing dramatic but I wonder whether a rephrase would help here.<br><br>-- Section 5.3 --<br><br>Should the 1. also includes NC entries that have expired ? Should 'communication' be qualified as on-link or not on-link ?<br><br>s/rightful owner/original owner/ because the first owner could actually be an attacker ;-)<br> <br>-- Section 5.3.2 --<br>s/The router receives the return traffic flows for both the rightful owner of the duplicated address and the new host. /The router receives the return traffic flows for the IPv6 addressed shared by the rightful owner of the duplicated address and the new host. / ?<br><br>-- Section 6 --<br>This section is only about routers but the nodes behavior must also be changed to send unsollicited NA. Where is it specified ?<br><br>-- Section 6.1.1 --<br>What should the router do if not discarding in "SHOULD be silently discarded." (last sentence)<br><br>-- Section 6.1.2 --<br>A trivial DISCUSS level but trusting Jen to fix it: missing the end of the NEW text as a line of dashes ;-)<br><br>How can a node execute "A node may also wish to notify its first-hop routers" ?<br><br>I wonder why some text is about "new global IPv6 address" in the replaced text about for anycast. I can only guess that it is not applicable to anycast but to all type of addresses. So, strongly suggest to move the part "A node may also...to preferred" *before* the § about anycast.<br><br>-- Section 8.3 --<br>s/default router/first-hop routers/ ?<br><br>-- Section 8.6 --<br>I wonder how many of the enumerated drawbacks also apply to this specification...

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:&nbsp; <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or<br>introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that<br>there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp;  Neighbor Discovery (<a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the<br>&nbsp;  link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and<br>&nbsp;  maintain reachability information.&nbsp; This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a> to<br>&nbsp;  allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 address is assigned to a node.&nbsp; It also updates <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a> and<br>&nbsp;  recommends nodes to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon<br>&nbsp;  assigning a new IPv6 address.&nbsp; The proposed change will minimize the<br>&nbsp;  delay and packet loss when a node initiate connections to off-link<br>&nbsp;  destination from a new IPv6 address.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was<br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where<br>the consensus was particularly rough?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The document had active discussion in the w.g. and there is a strong<br>&nbsp;  consensus to advance it.<br><br>&nbsp;  The discussion spawned a side discussion about security and Neighbor Discovery, but<br>&nbsp;  that is not related to this document, nor should it hold it up.<br><br>&nbsp;  Update:&nbsp;  After submitting to the IESG, the Area Directors requested<br>&nbsp;  that this draft be combined with .<br>&nbsp;  This version of the draft does that.&nbsp; We did a second working group<br>&nbsp;  call, V6OPS was cc'ed on the last call.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its<br>course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was<br>the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  It was well reviewed by the w.g., and has gone through two w.g. last<br>&nbsp;  calls as noted above.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is very clear on what changes it is making to <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>,<br>&nbsp;  show old text and new text.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  I, as Document Shepard and w.g. co-chair, have reviewed the document<br>&nbsp;  and w.g. discussion.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  I think it is ready for publication.<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of?

Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page<br>header?<br><br>&nbsp; Standards Track, Proposed Standard<br><br>&nbsp; This is the correct status, because it is updating <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a><br>&nbsp; "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)".<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up.

If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its<br>course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was<br>the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  It was well reviewed by the w.g.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is very clear on what changes it is making to <a href="/doc/rfc4861/">RFC4861</a>,<br>&nbsp;  show old text and new text.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it.
