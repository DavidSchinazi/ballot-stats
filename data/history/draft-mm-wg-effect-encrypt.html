I find this version to be much improved from the last time the IESG reviewed it.<br><br>However, I do not feel that I can support the publication of the document. While the tone has improved in many places and the introduction does a better job of contextualizing the document, the document still contains text in several sections that states service providers' claims about their practices as facts rather than stating them as claims or presenting the practices in a neutral way. This was a point raised in my previous DISCUSS (I've included my previous DISCUSS ballot text below in full for reference). In the previous review round Warren had invited recommendations for places where the tone or choice of words could be made more neutral or balanced, and I provided many detailed suggestions, but a number of those were not adopted. I also realize that the introduction contains much of the disclaimer text we previously hashed out to try to address this, but it doesn't contain all of it. So this is still a major issue for the document, IMO.<br><br>The document also still extemporizes about future possible impacts, making it hard to come away with a neutral view of their treatment, as I noted in my previous DISCUSS ballot.<br><br>I support the DISCUSS position held by Ekr. But given the above I don't think it will be fruitful for me to continue to engage on the details of this document, so I'm abstaining.<br><br>I've included below some of the areas that I still find problematic, as well as some nits.<br><br>Problematic areas:<br><br>= Section 2.1.2 =<br><br>(1)<br>"Network operators are often the first ones called upon to investigate<br>&nbsp;  application problems"<br><br>I still contend that without data to back this up, this claim should not be made, especially for the enterprise context.<br><br>(2)<br>"Vendors must be aware that in order for operators to better<br>&nbsp;  troubleshoot and manage networks with increasing amounts of encrypted<br>&nbsp;  traffic, built-in diagnostics and serviceability must be enhanced to<br>&nbsp;  provide detailed logging and debugging capabilities that, when<br>&nbsp;  possible, can reveal cleartext network parameters."<br><br>If I try to paraphrase this it sounds like "vendors should build in capabilities to decrypt encrypted traffic." Was that the intent?<br><br>= Section 2.2.4 =<br><br>I agree with Christian Huitema's unresolved comments on this section. In the thread regarding his comments Kathleen said "we don't want to make general statements that aren't necessarily true" -- IMO that is what the middle three paragraphs in this section are doing. At a minimum, I think the characterizations about the effects of performance-enhancing proxies needs to be qualified by saying "some operators find that ..." rather than stating their effects as fact.<br><br>= Section 2.2.7 =<br><br>"There is work in progress to specify protocols that permit Service<br>&nbsp;  Function Chaining (SFC)."<br><br>I don't think it makes sense to have this forward-looking statement when Section 1 states that "This document describes practices currently used by network operators to manage, operate, and secure their networks." I think it makes sense to focus this section on how existing SFC deployments have stopped functioning because of increased use of encrypted traffic, but it seems unfair to claim that some future, yet-to-deployed functionality will be broken.<br><br>= Section 2.3.2 =<br><br>"As a<br>&nbsp;  result, some mobile carriers block customer's encrypted requests,<br>&nbsp;  which is a far less optimal customer experience because the blocking<br>&nbsp;  reason must be conveyed by some other means."<br><br>This could easily be read to imply that sending requests in cleartext is optimal.<br><br>Overall, the use of the words "usual," "optimal," and "often" in this section imply a level of generality that is unwarranted I think. <br><br>= Section 5.6 =<br><br>The implications for SAVI seem speculative unless you can point to SAVI deployments that have been impacted by increased use of encryption.<br><br>Nits:<br><br>= Abstract =<br><br>s/Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users is<br>&nbsp;  of serious concern/Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users are of serious concern/<br><br>= Section 2.1.2 =<br><br>(1)<br>"Further, the performance of some services can be more efficiently<br>&nbsp;  managed and repaired when information on user transactions is<br>&nbsp;  available to the service provider.&nbsp; It may be possible to continue<br>&nbsp;  such monitoring activities without clear text access to the<br>&nbsp;  application layers of interest ..."<br><br>It's not clear what "such monitoring" refers to, since the previous sentence is about performance management and service repair.<br><br>(2)<br>Is "User/Service Key Quality Indicators" a term of art?

Kathleen's response to Martin reinforces the point that we were discussing in the first ballot cycle, which is that this document is written for and represents operators, not the broader array of Internet interests. Yet the suggestion to state that fact up front in the document was not adopted.<br><br>Having had some more time to review this document than I had in the previous ballot cycle, I also am finding myself in agreement with significant portions of the reviews from Martin and Christian. Reading their reviews helped crystallize a lot of the difficulty I had in parsing this document the first time around. <br><br>I understand the rationale that led to this document being written and I think there is a version of this document that could be written that would achieve the original goals while giving the subject matter a readable, neutral treatment. Such a version would be a useful contribution. But I don't think this document achieves that. In particular, there are four things that I think it would need to do to achieve that:<br><br>1. State the analysis in a neutral way. As I had mentioned in one of the email threads for the previous ballot cycle, I believe this document could be written in a neutral way -- e.g., “Service providers currently do X. It is implemented using Y mechanism. Encryption at Z layer breaks current implementations.” -- but it is not. Instead it characterizes many of the practices described as "optimizations" or "features" or "enrichment" and states service providers' claims about what these practices accomplish (e.g., "maximize QOE") as facts rather than stating them as the reasons given by service providers for why they engage in the practices. This is why in the previous round I suggested the disclaimer at the top of the document to say that the document is giving a view from service providers; that apparently didn't go anywhere, so the other option is to describe each technique neutrally, or explain with each technique that the characterization of the benefits is from the view of the operator. Martin's comments about being clear about who is benefitting point this out as well.<br><br>2. Limit the discussion to techniques presently being affected and those effects. There is a bunch of extemporizing about future possible impacts (e.g., in Sec. 2.7, 4.1.2, 4.1.3.1, 5.7, 7, 8). It's very hard to characterize future implications, who will bear the "cost" for what, whether increases in user complaints to various parties are "worth it," etc., in a way that is perceived as neutral by all affected parties. Better not to make predictions if the goal is to give a neutral treatment of network functions being impacted today.<br><br>3. Acknowledge the controversy. Many of the practices described in this document are controversial, and have been for a long time. There is nothing wrong with that. I agree with Christian that it would be better to state an understanding of that head-on rather than leave it to the reader to decide whether any particular characterization of something described implies an endorsement of it. This has been done before, even in potentially controversial documents that this document references, e.g. <a href="/doc/rfc3135/">RFC 3135</a>.<br><br>4. Structure the document in a way that is consistent and logical with minimal repetition. It seems like there are multiple ways that this could be done. Organizing based on use case (per Christian) and then discussing techniques used within each use case is one way; organizing based on technique while mentioning the goals for which each technique is employed is another. At present the document is jumble of these.</div></td>

I think it should also include a mention of <a href="/doc/rfc8165/">RFC 8165</a>.&nbsp; <br><br>-5.2: This section doesn't seem to include discussion of the impact of encryption.<br><br>Editorial and nits:<br><br>-IDNits finds a number of unused references, and a few other reference issues. Please check.<br><br>- Abstract: 2nd sentence is hard to parse, and ends with a comma splice.<br><br>- 1, 2nd paragraph: " The following informational<br>&nbsp;  documents consider the end to end (e2e) architectural principle, a<br>&nbsp;  guiding principle for the development of Internet protocols [<a href="/doc/rfc2775/">RFC2775</a>]<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc3724/">RFC3724</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc7754/">RFC7754</a>]."<br><br>Is the comma correct? It currently reads along the lines of "The documents consider the e2e principle, and we think that it is a guiding principle...", but I think you might mean "The documents consider the e2e to be a guiding principle..."<br><br>-1, 3rd paragraph: "... (including methods for network<br>&nbsp;  endpoints where applicable)..."<br>Should that say "methods that rely on network endpoints"?<br><br>-2.1.1: Please expand "CAIDA"<br><br>-2.1.1: Paragraph starting with "<br>&nbsp;  When using increased encryption, operators lose a source of data that<br>&nbsp;  may be used to debug user issues."<br>I don't think the operators are the ones using the encreased encryption in that sentence. Perhaps "When endpoints use increased encryption..." or even (When increased encryption is used..."<br><br>-2.1.3, 2nd paragraph: "The ability to examine layers and payloads<br>&nbsp;  above transport provides a new range of filtering opportunities at<br>&nbsp;  each layer in the clear. "<br>Should "new range" be "increased range"?<br><br>-2.1.3, third paragraph: The last sentence seems out of place. Is the point of the paragraph to point out that the use of these monitoring techniques for DoS mitigation can't be distinguished from the use of them for privacy violation?<br><br>-2.2.1: Please expand "QUIC" and add a citation.<br><br>-2.2.3, last sentence: Sentence fragment.<br><br>-2.2.4, first sentence: Comma splice.<br><br>-2.2.5, first paragraph: " Encryption of packet contents at a given<br>&nbsp;  protocol layer usually makes DPI processing of that layer and higher<br>&nbsp;  layers impossible. "<br><br>This sentence seems misplaced; the section is not about DPI.<br><br>-- same paragraph: I don't understand the point(s) of the last two sentences.<br><br>-2.2.5, third paragraph: "The Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast/<br>&nbsp;  Multicast Services (3GPP eMBMS) - trusted edge proxies facilitate<br>&nbsp;  delivering same stream to different users, using either unicast or<br>&nbsp;  multicast depending on channel conditions to the user. "<br><br>I can't parse that sentence.<br><br>-2.3.3: Please make the "SHOULD" lower case. Since this document does not use <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a>/8174 keywords, a capitalized SHOULD should not appear outside of a literal quote.<br><br>-3: "Businesses understanding the<br>&nbsp;  threats of monitoring in hosted environments only increased that<br>&nbsp;  pressure to provide more secure access and session encryption"<br><br>Why "only"? That seems to suggest one would expect some different result.<br><br>-3.1.2: This section is about Hosting SPs, but the last two paragraphs seem to be about ASPs. While I realize those may sometimes be the same organization, they are architecturally distinct.<br><br>-3.2.2: "STARTTLS ought have zero effect..."<br>"Ought to have zero effect" or "has little effect"?&nbsp; (If the former, it's safe to say "should" since this draft does not use <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords.)<br><br>-3.2.2, last paragraph: Should "SPAM filtering" be "content-based SPAM filtering"?<br><br>-4.2: What does it mean for tools to "use" keywords? Does this mean "search for" or "monitor for" keywords?<br><br>-5.4: This seems to say that "Detection and Mitigations" involves thousands of hosts, etc. I think the point is that the botnets themselves may involve thousands of hosts..."<br><br>-7 and subsections: It looks like the editing of this section is not finished; several sections indicate they are to be deleted. <br><br>-7.4: Please describe what you mean by "transit proxies". <br><br>I can't parse item 4. The entire section could use proofreading for missing articles.<br><br>-12: Are there really no normative references? The definition of a "normative reference" is any reference needed to fully implement or _understand_ the document. This is true for both informational and standards-track documents. Do you think a reader can fully understand this document if they ignore every reference?&nbsp; (I'm willing to accept that the answer might be "yes" given the nature of this draft--but that situation is rare in practice.)</div></td>

Minimally, I would suggest restructuring the sentence<br>fragments in this section into sentences. I will also note that section 2<br>indicates that the following sections will discuss both (a) purpose of the<br>technique, and (b) fields used to achieve this purpose.

The document is rather long and has some redundancy due to the structure: while sections 2.-4. are split based on the type of network operator, sections 5. and 6. are split based on the protocol layer. Further I think section 2 could be further extended because there are more cases to cover, also see (section 3 of) <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits-03">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits-03</a>. See for more concrete and mostly editorial comments below:<br><br>1) sec 2.1.1: "The definition of a flow will be based on a<br>&nbsp;  combination of header fields, often as many as five for 5-tuple flows<br>&nbsp; (including addresses and ports for source and destination, and one<br>&nbsp;  additional field such as the DSCP or other priority marking)."<br>Usually the 5th field is the protocol number; I'm not aware of any load balancers that look at DSCP...?<br><br>2) sec 2.1.4 seems to cover two different cases: caching and differential treatment<br><br>3) sec 2.1.6. should probably be called "Content Filtering" and "Mobility Middlebox Content Filtering" should be an own subsection, as parental filtering is not specific to mobile networks.<br><br>4) I don't really understand why sec 2.1.7 "Access and Policy Enforcement" is a subsection of 2.1 "Middlebox Monitoring". Was that on purpose or an error? Actually I don't really understand the structure of section 2 at all. What's the difference between 2.1 and 2.2? I would group section 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3 under Traffic Monitoring and move all other subsections of 2.1 one level up...<br><br>5) sec 3 rather describes how encryption is already used and doesn't not really discuss any effects of increased use of encryption.<br><br>6) there is quite some overlap between section 2 and 4.1.3. as the problems on monitoring/troubleshoot are the same for enterprise network and other networks; the only difference is that in enterprises TLS interception may be acceptable while it's not for network operators. However, it would still be good to better align these sections.<br><br>7) section 6 only describes with information is visible but not how and if this information is used and what would happen if this information would go away.<br><br>8) section 7 should be integrated in the introduction because it sets the context for this document and it's not needed to have read the rest of the document to understand this section.</div></td>

While feedback to improve this specific situation has been solicited from Martin, it has been scantly more than a day since that request has been made.

If I count correctly, we have support for a document that fills this niche from Badri and Elliot, the most tepid statement of support I've seen in quite a while from Stuart (which itself concedes that the document diverges in tone and content from prior IETF statements on related topics), and rather strong statements of opposition from Martin and Christian. The objections by both Martin and Christian are substantive and structural; and many of the primary concerns they express appear to remain unresolved.<br><br>I understand the temptation to dismiss many of the objecting comments about structure and tone as editorial in nature; but this document lands squarely in the middle of a policy area in which the IETF (and the IAB in particular) has written extensively and carefully, in at least RFCs 1984, 2804, 7258, and 7754, among probably others that escape my notice at the moment; and this also includes IAB statements on the topic, such as . Due to this factor, I believe that obtaining IETF consensus on tone rather than merely technical content is warranted in this case.<br><br>____<br>Addendum: Some of the documents that "escape[d] my notice" above include RFCs 1958 and 3724 (and in particular sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of the latter document).</div></td>

I understand that the goal here is to be neutral in the way the document presents these topics (and I don't believe the current form achieves even that), but I believe that's the wrong goal.<br><br>To be clear, I don't want to pretend that these techniques don't exist in the wild, but I think the current formulation (and section 2 in particular) casts certain third-party entities as "victims of encryption"; when, in fact, most of these behaviors have been proscribed by IETF protocols and architecture documents for years. This is especially salient in light of the fact that such proscription has typically been precisely for the reason that these behaviors presume that traffic behavior can never evolve (e.g. that there will never be an increase in the use of encryption), and that behavior is now finally evolving.<br><br>The RFCs I cite in my discuss actually do stake out specific policy positions that pertain to overall Internet architecture; and, while I don't expect this document to necessarily reiterate all of them, it should at least be consistent with them.&nbsp; In the context of the clear statements made by these policy documents, much of the text of the current document reads as an attempt to pussyfoot around sensibilities of entities who may not agree with established and published IETF consensus; but that should not be the goal (even if much of the target audience of this document includes such entities). We have published statements that many of the behaviors described in this document are *not* neutral, and attempting to *treat* them in a neutral fashion is explicitly going against that consensus. To be clear: yes, I am suggesting that description, in this document, of behaviors that are discouraged by the documents I cite above should be accompanied by clearer disclaimers that they are, and have historically been, considered by the IETF to be fundamentally detrimental.<br><br>I read some of the comments so far on this draft as wanting to revise the direction the IETF takes on these topics. That's a far broader conversation than pertains to this document; if we want to discuss that, I think we need to halt processing this document entirely and engage the IAB in a conversation around whether the aforementioned policy documents got it wrong.<br><br>_____<br><br>Some nuts and bolts of lesser consequence:<br><br>I think I've seen some messages about the potentially adversarial relationships that can arise in three- (or more) party communications, which is highly relevant; however, the document doesn't appear to have any treatment of this issue. In particular, I believe that the increased use of encryption may arise *because* of the behaviors being described, rather than despite them.<br><br>I agree with Ben's comment that the document suffers from explaining what is being done rather than why it is being done in some places. Ostensibly, a major part of the document's purpose is to foster discussion about how network operators can continue to manage their network in the face of encryption; but it will be difficult to discuss alternative approaches to meet their goals if those goals are not explained.<br><br>Section 2.3.2.1 mentions CDNs in a way that I find very confusing. Typically, CDNs are operated by or in cooperation with the entities providing authoritative content. Those entities are ostensibly both (a) the parties impacted by encryption, and (b) the parties choosing whether to use encryption. Clearly this can't be what you meant, since that reduces to a "doctor, it hurts when I do this" situation. I think a better description of the CDN scenario in this section is called for, if it is retained.<br><br>Section 2.4 describes "undesirable security practices" in generic terms. At least for browsers (the cited application), it's not clear to me precisely what kind of practices are being alluded to.

I suspect an earlier document spoke of some process by which use cases were gathered from interested parties?<br><br>I think the scenario described in section 2.5.3 does not match the scope of this document (encryption). The problem being described is introduced by authentication of servers, not by encryption of content. I suggest either removing the scenario, or expanding the scope of the document to include problems introduced by authentication.<br><br>Section 2.6.1's assertions of a problem arising from encryption seem circular. It can be summarized as: the problem that arises from traffic being encrypted is that some traffic is not encrypted. This should be removed or clarified. This same tautology appears in section 3.1.<br><br>In section 2.6.5, the reference to non-CPNI data is using a really obscure and technically precise term, and really calls for a definition inline.<br><br>Section 2.7 discusses a number of problems that could arise from IP-level encryption, but which don't arise with the encryption that is commonly used on the Internet today. For example, analysis of TCP options, congestion window, etc. are not precluded by the use of TLS (as TCP information is sent in the clear); and the use of SRTP does not preclude analysis of VoIP traffic, as SRTP sends all the information used by DPI boxes in plaintext. As this document seems to be focusing on the practical effects of today's encryption deployment rather than the theoretical impacts of future widespread IPSEC deployment, these should probably be removed or heavily qualified. (n.b. -- I am not intimately familiar with the current level of IPSEC deployment in the Internet at large for typical large-scale consumer applications, and may be operating from an outdated view of its likely impact)<br><br>I'm not sure the mention of websockets in Section 2.7 is helpful: using HTTP for the types of operations cited has been a widely-used part of web browser behavior since the introduction of XMLHttpRequest over a decade ago. I think this would be improved if mention of Websockets were dropped entirely, and the paragraph were merely cast as the increase in use of port 443 for things other than simple web page retrieval.<br><br>Section 3.1.2 is very confusing -- it's muddy about which encryption here is desired by SPs, which encryption is posing novel challenges for them, and how they interact with each other. I think what's being described is a scenario in which an HTTPS connection is being terminated on a front end that can authenticate as the expected domain, decrypt the content, and then turn around and re-encrypt it. It's really not clear how this is impacted by the increased deployment of encryption, since the scenario only arises when encryption is required by the SP.<br><br>I'm not the expert here, but I think I've heard that there's some thinking around how to close the "SNI Hole," so it's probably relevant and useful to mention that this technique's days may be numbered as well.<br><br>Section 6.3 should probably mention the issues discussed in <a href="/doc/rfc6562/">RFC 6562</a>, including in particular the guidance in section 5 of that document.

I understand that the goal here is to be neutral in the way the document presents these topics (and I don't believe the current form achieves even that), but I believe that's the wrong goal.<br><br>To be clear, I don't want to pretend that these techniques don't exist in the wild, but I think the current formulation (and section 2 in particular) casts certain third-party entities as "victims of encryption"; when, in fact, most of these behaviors have been proscribed by IETF protocols and architecture documents for years. This is especially salient in light of the fact that such proscription has typically been precisely for the reason that these behaviors presume that traffic behavior can never evolve (e.g. that there will never be an increase in the use of encryption), and that behavior is now finally evolving.<br><br>The RFCs I cite in my discuss actually do stake out specific policy positions that pertain to overall Internet architecture; and, while I don't expect this document to necessarily reiterate all of them, it should at least be consistent with them.&nbsp; In the context of the clear statements made by these policy documents, much of the text of the current document reads as an attempt to pussyfoot around sensibilities of entities who may not agree with established and published IETF consensus; but that should not be the goal (even if much of the target audience of this document includes such entities). We have published statements that many of the behaviors described in this document are *not* neutral, and attempting to *treat* them in a neutral fashion is explicitly going against that consensus. To be clear: yes, I am suggesting that description, in this document, of behaviors that are discouraged by the documents I cite above should be accompanied by clearer disclaimers that they are, and have historically been, considered by the IETF to be fundamentally detrimental.<br><br>I read some of the comments so far on this draft as wanting to revise the direction the IETF takes on these topics. That's a far broader conversation than pertains to this document; if we want to discuss that, I think we need to halt processing this document entirely and engage the IAB in a conversation around whether the aforementioned policy documents got it wrong.<br><br>_____<br><br>Some nuts and bolts of lesser consequence:<br><br>I think I've seen some messages about the potentially adversarial relationships that can arise in three- (or more) party communications, which is highly relevant; however, the document doesn't appear to have any treatment of this issue. In particular, I believe that the increased use of encryption may arise *because*of the behaviors being described, rather than despite them.<br><br>I agree with Ben's comment that the document suffers from explaining what is being done rather than why it is being done in some places. Ostensibly, a major part of the document's purpose is to foster discussion about how network operators can continue to manage their network in the face of encryption; but it will be difficult to discuss alternative approaches to meet their goals if those goals are not explained.<br><br>Section 2.3.2.1 mentions CDNs in a way that I find very confusing. Typically, CDNs are operated by or in cooperation with the entities providing authoritative content. Those entities are ostensibly both (a) the parties impacted by encryption, and (b) the parties choosing whether to use encryption. Clearly this can't be what you meant, since that reduces to a "doctor, it hurts when I do this" situation. I think a better description of the CDN scenario in this section is called for, if it is retained.<br><br>Section 2.4 describes "undesirable security practices" in generic terms. At least for browsers (the cited application), it's not clear to me precisely what kind of practices are being alluded to.

Privacy concerns are critical to both users and operators. It's not encryption that is evil.<br><br>Operators themselves are very aware that their methods used in a pre-encrypted era may be used by "bad actors" and so the methods themselves are becoming more complex to manage in today's bad-actor world.<br><br>And the use of encryption is not blindly recommended by IETF with disregard for network operations. <a href="/doc/rfc7258/">RFC7258</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7435/">RFC7435</a>, and other documents discussed network management issues and use of encryption. And there's been an IAB workshop on managing radio networks in an encrypted world.<br><br>Suggest:<br>In the abstract, the first sentence "Increased use of encryption impacts operations" sets a negative tone "operators vs. IETF and privacy advocates". It infers IETF disregarded operational impacts in recommending encryption. I think it would be good to "set the stage" differently, adding more on <a href="/doc/rfc7258/">RFC7258</a> and why encryption is needed in today's world, e.g.:<br>"Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users is of serious concern to both the user and operator community. <a href="/doc/rfc7258/">RFC7258</a> discussed the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications and also recognized making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, an appropriate balance is needed. This document discusses current security and network management practices that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol development in support of manageable, secure networks."<br><br>As Warren mentioned, the document "sells" the many capabilities possible when not using encryption and in some items even argues (2.3.1) that encryption is not a "panacea". This tone is unnecessarily negative - are the draft's motives to help us understand operational concerns or to argue that encryption is no better as there are always corner cases? It would be more fair if it also mentioned the well-known security tradeoffs when not using encryption.<br><br>I think the document would be better perceived if it scoped itself to management issues vs. business motivations e.g. 2.3.2.1 on caching. Statements saying encryption is used for "intentional control" by the user, and not privacy motivated, are not within the scope of IETF. And, it infers any/all encryption is evil.<br><br>This is an important document, let's get it right. I think in its current state, it will confuse the industry. I don't think we need to rush to publish this document.</div></td>

Kathleen's response to Martin reinforces the point that we were discussing in the first ballot cycle, which is that this document is written for and represents operators, not the broader array of Internet interests. Yet the suggestion to state that fact up front in the document was not adopted.<br><br>Having had some more time to review this document than I had in the previous ballot cycle, I also am finding myself in agreement with significant portions of the reviews from Martin and Christian. Reading their reviews helped crystallize a lot of the difficulty I had in parsing this document the first time around. <br><br>I understand the rationale that led to this document being written and I think there is a version of this document that could be written that would achieve the original goals while giving the subject matter a readable, neutral treatment. Such a version would be a useful contribution. But I don't think this document achieves that. In particular, there are four things that I think it would need to do to achieve that:<br><br>1. State the analysis in a neutral way. As I had mentioned in one of the email threads for the previous ballot cycle, I believe this document could be written in a neutral way -- e.g., “Service providers currently do X. It is implemented using Y mechanism. Encryption at Z layer breaks current implementations.” -- but it is not. Instead it characterizes many of the practices described as "optimizations" or "features" or "enrichment" and states service providers' claims about what these practices accomplish (e.g., "maximize QOE") as facts rather than stating them as the reasons given by service providers for why they engage in the practices. This is why in the previous round I suggested the disclaimer at the top of the document to say that the document is giving a view from service providers; that apparently didn't go anywhere, so the other option is to describe each technique neutrally, or explain with each technique that the characterization of the benefits is from the view of the operator. Martin's comments about being clear about who is benefitting point this out as well.<br><br>2. Limit the discussion to techniques presently being affected and those effects. There is a bunch of extemporizing about future possible impacts (e.g., in Sec. 2.7, 4.1.2, 4.1.3.1, 5.7, 7, 8). It's very hard to characterize future implications, who will bear the "cost" for what, whether increases in user complaints to various parties are "worth it," etc., in a way that is perceived as neutral by all affected parties. Better not to make predictions if the goal is to give a neutral treatment of network functions being impacted today.<br><br>3. Acknowledge the controversy. Many of the practices described in this document are controversial, and have been for a long time. There is nothing wrong with that. I agree with Christian that it would be better to state an understanding of that head-on rather than leave it to the reader to decide whether any particular characterization of something described implies an endorsement of it. This has been done before, even in potentially controversial documents that this document references, e.g. <a href="/doc/rfc3135/">RFC 3135</a>.<br><br>4. Structure the document in a way that is consistent and logical with minimal repetition. It seems like there are multiple ways that this could be done. Organizing based on use case (per Christian) and then discussing techniques used within each use case is one way; organizing based on technique while mentioning the goals for which each technique is employed is another. At present the document is jumble of these.</div></td>

Specifically, this document, while perhaps not<br>saying anything actually false, essentially only presents the<br>perspective of operators and service providers. In many cases, those<br>interests are adverse to those of users -- and in many cases<br>encryption is used specifically to prevent operators from providing<br>the "services" and "enhancements" contemplated by this document.&nbsp; For<br>these reasons, I don't believe that the uncritical treamtent of these<br>activities presented in this document should be published as an<br>RFC that claims to have IETF Consensus.<br><br>I have made specific comments below that indicate some of the more<br>serious issues, but the problems here are systematic and require<br>more than simple edits.<br><br>S 1.<br>&nbsp;  draft includes a collection of<br>&nbsp;  current security and network management functions<br><br>The functions presented here in many cases go far beyond security<br>and management.

As far as I can tell,<br>the CALEA requirements only apply to carriers who have access to the<br>keying material.<br><br>&nbsp;  The loss of access to these fields may<br>&nbsp;  prompt undesirable security practices in order to gain access to the<br>&nbsp;  fields in unencrypted data flows.<br><br>As Martin Thomson indicates, this feels like a threat.<br><br><br>S 2.1.<br>As Martin and Christian indicate, this QUIC material is entirely<br>speculative and extremely controversial and you should remove it.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, a system that is able to encode the identity of the<br>&nbsp;  pool server in plain text information available in each incoming<br>&nbsp;  packet is able to provide stateless load balancing.<br><br>This doesn't have to be in plaintext because the pool load balancer<br>has a relationship with the servers. We already have designs for this<br>for QIC.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Current protocols, such as TCP, allow the development of stateless<br>&nbsp;  integrated load balancers by availing such load balancers of<br>&nbsp;  additional plain text information in client-to-server packets.&nbsp; (In<br>&nbsp;  case of TCP, such information can be encoded by having server-<br>&nbsp;  generated sequence numbers, mss values, lengths of the packet sent,<br>&nbsp;  etc.)<br><br>How does this help the load balancer direct traffic.<br><br>S 2.2.<br>&nbsp;  Internet traffic surveys are useful in many well-intentioned<br><br>"Well-intentioned" is pretty tendentious here.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  pursuits, such as CAIDA data [CAIDA] and SP network design and<br>&nbsp;  optimization.<br><br>I'd be interested in hearing which CAIDA studies are impacted by<br>content encryption.

If it is the former, I am not sure this is relevant in this section.<br><br>&nbsp;  Following the Snowden revelations, application service providers<br>&nbsp;  responded by encrypting traffic between their data centers to prevent<br>&nbsp;  passive monitoring from taking place unbeknownst to the providers<br>&nbsp;  (Yahoo, Google, etc.).<br><br>* Section 2.1.4.<br><br>This text below is not entirely true. There are other mechanisms by which the user traffic can be separated without DPI (e.g. dedicated bearers have existed for a very long time to separate traffic). <br><br>&nbsp;  "Ideally, the<br>&nbsp;  scheduler manages the queue so that each user has an acceptable<br>&nbsp;  experience as conditions vary, but the traffic type has been required<br>&nbsp;  to be known to date."<br><br>* Section 2.1.7.2<br><br>Since there is some sort of prior arrangement for this zero rating can't this be done by getting a list of IP addresses?<br><br>* Section 3.2.1.<br><br>Wouldn't server side logs and/or 5 tuple be enough to make these metrics work especially for managed applications (e.g. correlate managed application to ip address and port and then use 5 tuple on packet)?<br><br>* Section 4.1.1.<br><br>In at least some of the enterprises I have seen, the security enforcement is seen at the endpoints for the company owned devices. There are also new endpoint security solutions being enforced in BYOD environments (e.g. VMware Airwatch). This section seems to gloss over the fact.<br><br>* Section 5.6.<br><br>The SLAAC reference is wrong.

I suspect you refer to the 7435 mention that OS may offer an evolution path to authenticated, encrypted communication. But as written, It sounds like it is trying to say OS offers an upgrade option for a particular session.<br><br>- 2.1.1: I'm not sure I follow the part about encryption that conceals the 5-tuple from a load balancer. The scenarios that spring to mind fall into the "why would anyone do that" category, but I assume that's due to my own lack of imagination.&nbsp; A concrete example might help. <br><br>-2.1.2, paragraph 2: How is filtering on higher-layer data related to traffic analysis?<br><br>-2.1.4: This section seems to treat DPI as an end in itself. It's a tool to be used to accomplish certain goals, but if those goals went away, I don't think people would be too worried about the loss of DPI.<br><br>- 3.1.1: Again, I'm confused by the part about encryption that conceals the 5-tuple in the context of filtering. Is previously untunneled traffic becoming tunneled without the cooperation of hosted service provider or application provider?<br><br>- 3.1.2:I'm confused by this case. In the ASP case, I would assume the same authority would control at least one application endpoint as controls the network, and therefore should be able to get whatever information they need from that endpoint. Is there some assumption that this is not the case? If so, it would be worth mentioning.</div></td>

Was that on purpose or an error? Actually I don't really understand the structure of section 2 at all. What's the difference between 2.1 and 2.2? I would group section 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3 under Traffic Monitoring and move all other subsections of 2.1 one level up...<br><br>5) sec 3 rather describes how encryption is already used and doesn't not really discuss any effects of increased use of encryption.<br><br>6) there is quite some overlap between section 2 and 4.1.3. as the problems on monitoring/troubleshoot are the same for enterprise network and other networks; the only difference is that in enterprises TLS interception may be acceptable while it's not for network operators. However, it would still be good to better align these sections.<br><br>7) section 6 only describes with information is visible but not how and if this information is used and what would happen if this information would go away.<br><br>8) section 7 should be integrated in the introduction because it sets the context for this document and it's not needed to have read the rest of the document to understand this section.</div></td>

Summary ===<br><br>This Informational document is a fairly extensive collection of security and network management functions that will likely be impacted by the increased use of encryption. Note that this document is a list of issues; there is no attempt to ameleroate the problems in the list. It is meant to help those who are attempting to create solutions to the problem by giving a taxonomy of problems and a list of useful references.<br><br>Paul Hoffman is the document shepherd; Stephen Farrell is the responsible AD.<br><br>=== 2. Review and Consensus ===<br><br>This is an AD-sponsored document. It was discussed in SAAG, both on the mailing list and in at least one face-to-face meeting (IETF 97). The list discussion was not heavy, but there was clearly enough intputs to the authors to see a reasonable amount of improvement between the recent drafts. It is likely that an IETF-wide last call will generate more suggestions for additions and clarifications.<br><br>=== 3. Intellectual Property ===<br><br>Both authors have disclaimed any knowledge of IPR issues with this document.<br><br>=== 4. Other Points ===<br><br>Documents of this type (taxonomies and reference lists that can be used by others who are crafting solutions to problems) have been useful in earlier work, and this document is likely to be a significant help to the security community.<br><br>Minor stuff:<br><br>idnits found one easy-to-fix error (a cross-reference to [SACM] with no matching target).<br><br>The reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> seems gratuitous and could be eliminated without reducing the value of the document. I also don't see a reason for <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a> to be "normative"; it feels like all references for this document should be "informative".<br><br>There is inconsistent capitalization in the references to non-RFCs; this trivial matter can be dealt with after IETF Last Call or by the RFC Editor (or can be ignored altogether, really).</div></td>
