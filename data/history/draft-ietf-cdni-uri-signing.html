I think a couple of my<br>discuss points remain at the discuss level, which I'll expound on a bit more<br>below.<br><br>I am happy to see the pervasive disclaimers that use of a symmetric shared<br>key is supported but NOT RECOMMENDED, and the note that redistribution of<br>the symmetric shared key to dCDNs (including cascaded CDNs) is included for<br>legacy feature parity and highly discouraged in new implementations.<br>However, I think this does not fully address my original discuss point.&nbsp; As<br>I said then, [[I see a minimal acknowledgment that there is potential cause<br>concern in the penultimate paragraph of the security considerations that "it<br>is important to know the implications of a compromised shared key", but in<br>my mind the text there does not really call out the severity of those<br>implications.&nbsp; I would have expected something like "redistributing the<br>shared key in this manner allows the dCDNs to impersonate the CSP to the<br>uCDN and produce arbitrary signed URLs that are accepted by the uCDN as<br>authentic".]]&nbsp; In particular, I think it is important to emphasize in some<br>manner that the cryptographc properties of the symmetric shared key are<br>fully symmetric across all participants, even though the administrative and<br>organizational structure here is hierarchical with explicitly more- and<br>less-trusted entities, making the symmetric cryptographic mechanism a<br>mismatch for the desired trust boundaries and inviting abuse.&nbsp; Only<br>contractual controls prevent misuse in this scenario, whereas we have<br>well-understood technologies that allow technical measures to prevent misuse<br>that are preferred.<br><br>It's also still unclear to me that there's sufficient need to document the<br>symmetric key *redistribution* case in this document at all, if the only use<br>case is for "legacy feature parity".&nbsp; Given that it's a fairly simple idea,<br>what is to stop us from leaving it undocumented in this Proposed Standard<br>and letting any implementors that need it do so on their own, or with a<br>separate Informational document mentioning its existence?&nbsp; I am not aware of<br>any preexisting IETF work that we need to retain compatibility with, and the<br>data presented so far does not make a compelling (to me) case that we must<br>include this functionality in order for the IETF offering to be competitive.<br>(To be clear, I do not object to describing the use of symmetric keys for a<br>single-hop scenario, as the risks there are much smaller.)<br><br>I'd also like to have some additional discussion on this point from my<br>previous Discuss position, reproduced with typo fixed:<br>===<br>The combined defaults for the CDNI Metadata Interface for URI Signing seem<br>to be an unsafe combination.&nbsp; Specifically, the default behavior for the<br>"issuers" property is to allow any Issuer, and the default for the<br>"jwt-header" property is to take the header from the JWT in band.&nbsp; As far as<br>I can tell, this means that the dCDN will just blindly accept anything that<br>is formatted as a JWT and signed by any key known to the dCDN.&nbsp; The<br>authentication and authorization properties of such behavior are so poor so<br>as to effectively be useless, absent some level of care surrounding key<br>management to isolate keys to given URIs.&nbsp; In fact, the lack of substantive<br>discussion of key management and requirements thereof seems Discuss-worthy<br>in its own right.&nbsp; We need to say something about obtaining a key along with<br>a trust path to what it's authorized to be used for, even if the specific<br>protocol mechanism for doing so is left out of scope.<br>===<br>I do see that §1.3 gained a mention of "obtain the key in a manner that<br>allows trust to be placed in the assertions made using that key", apparently<br>per my suggestion in my original COMMENT section.&nbsp; However, I don't think<br>this is sufficient.&nbsp; I strongly encourage a dedicated section on the<br>requirements for key management and how updates (both additions and<br>removals) of the list of trusted Issuer/key pairs are managed.&nbsp; Failing<br>that, at a minimum the default for the "issuers" property in the CDNI<br>Metadata Interface needs to be changed to say that an empty list means that<br>any Issuer in the dCDN's trusted key store of issuers is acceptable for<br>signing JWTs for URI signing.&nbsp; This is to be contrasted with "any Issuer at<br>all", which does not impose an obligation on the dCDN to maintain a list of<br>Issuer/key pairs trusted for signing JWTs used in signed URIs.</div></td>

 [...]<br>&nbsp;  JWT.&nbsp; If applicable, the CDN checks whether the source IP address of<br>&nbsp;  the HTTP request matches the one in the Signed URI and/or if the time<br>&nbsp;  window is still valid.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Similarly, even if we may feel a need to include IP address in the<br>description here for completeness, we might want to shift the focus by<br>mentioning the more-recommended option first.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; URI Signing Package (URISigningPackage): The URI attribute that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulates all the URI Signing claims in a signed JWT encoded<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; format.&nbsp; This attribute is exposed in the Signed URI as a path-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; style parameter or a form-style parameter.<br><br>Is there a good reference for "URI attribute"?&nbsp; It sounds like should be<br>a technical term but I couldn't find a clear definition.<br><br>&nbsp;  The URI Signing Package will be found by parsing any path-style<br>&nbsp;  parameters and form-style parameters looking for a key name matching<br>&nbsp;  the URI Signing Package Attribute.&nbsp; Both parameter styles MUST be<br>&nbsp;  supported to allow flexibility of operation.&nbsp; The first matching<br>&nbsp;  parameter SHOULD be taken to provide the signed JWT, though providing<br>&nbsp;  more than one matching key is undefined behavior.&nbsp; Path-style<br>&nbsp;  parameters generated in the form indicated by Section 3.2.7 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6570/">RFC6570</a>] MUST be supported.&nbsp; Form-style parameters generated in the<br>&nbsp;  form indicated by Sections 3.2.8 and 3.2.9 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6570/">RFC6570</a>] MUST be<br>&nbsp;  supported.<br><br>The last two sentences seem a bit redundant with the second sentence<br>("Both parameter styles MUST be supported..."); it would be advisable to at<br>least use a lowercase "must" in the earlier sentence to avoid stating the<br>same normative requirement twice, if not just remove the redundant content<br>entirely.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The following claims (where the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry<br>&nbsp;  claim name is specified in parenthesis below) are used to enforce the<br>&nbsp;  distribution policies.&nbsp; All of the listed claims are mandatory to<br>&nbsp;  implement in a URI Signing implementation, but are not mandatory to<br>&nbsp;  use in a given signed JWT.&nbsp; (The "optional" and "mandatory"<br>&nbsp;  identifiers in square brackets refer to whether or not a given claim<br>&nbsp;  MUST be present in a URI Signing JWT.)<br><br>The final parenthetical suggests that the previous sentence should read<br>"not necessarily mandatory to use" (since apparently some of them *are*<br>mandatory to use).&nbsp; Though I do see this was noted by Roman as well.&nbsp; I<br>would be interested to hear why cdniuc is not mandatory (see below)...<br><br>&nbsp;  Note: The time on the entities that generate and verify the signed<br>&nbsp;  URI MUST be in sync.&nbsp; In the CDNI case, this means that CSP, uCDN,<br>&nbsp;  and dCDN servers need to be time-synchronized.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED to<br>&nbsp;  use NTP [<a href="/doc/rfc5905/">RFC5905</a>] for time synchronization.<br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/rfc8915/">RFC 8915</a> presents Network Time Security for NTP, which might be<br>a helpful reference (and, arguably, worth recommending in its own right).<br><a href="/doc/rfc8633/">RFC 8633</a> is <a href="/doc/bcp223/">BCP 223</a>, "Network Time Protocol Best Current Practices", also<br>worth referencing.<br><br>Section 2.1.x<br><br>[retained from my previous ballot position for posterity]<br>In general, my stance is that it's redundant to say that "the semantics<br>in Section X of <a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC 7519</a> MUST be followed", because that's inherent in<br>the definition of the JWT claim.&nbsp; But you're free to write the text as<br>you wish.<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Issuer (iss) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.1<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; If this claim is used, it MUST be used to confirm<br>&nbsp;  that the indicated key was provided by said issuer and used to sign<br>&nbsp;  the JWT.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm really confused at how these words fit together.&nbsp; Is "the indicated key"<br>supposed to be a single unique key associated with the Issuer as identified<br>by the "iss" claim?&nbsp; This is in general not true, as a given Issuer can have<br>more than one key in use.&nbsp; Furthermore, what does it mean for the key to<br>have been "provided by" said issuer?&nbsp; Provided when, as part of what<br>protocol flow?&nbsp; If I ignore this sentence and just try to write something<br>based on my knowledge of JWT and expectations for how the CDNI URI Signing<br>works, I would write "If this claim is used, it MUST be used to identify the<br>issuer (signer) of the JWT.&nbsp; In particular, the recipient will have already<br>received, in trusted configuration, a mapping of issuer name to one or more<br>keys used to sign JWTs, and must verify that the JWT was signed by one of<br>those keys."<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the CDN verifying the signed JWT does not support Issuer<br>&nbsp;  verification, or if the Issuer in the signed JWT does not match the<br>&nbsp;  list of known acceptable Issuers, the CDN MUST reject the request.<br><br>I think this is intended to be "If this claim is used and the CDN verifying<br>the signed JWT [...]".<br><br>Also, I think this list also needs to include "if the Issuer claim does not<br>match the key used to sign the JWT".<br><br>Section 2.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Subject (sub) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.2<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; If this claim is used, it MUST be a JSON Web<br>&nbsp;  Encryption (JWE [<a href="/doc/rfc7516/">RFC7516</a>]) Object in compact serialization form,<br>&nbsp;  because it contains personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This claim<br><br>While I am happy to see that the subject information is recognized as<br>PII and required to be protected, it seems that this formulation is<br>over-constrained.&nbsp; Why does the Subject specifically need to be<br>compact-serialization-form JWE, as opposed to some other encrypted form<br>(that cannot be correlated to other instances of the same encrypted<br>Subject?&nbsp; Why does just using a signed-and-encrypted JWT for the<br>containing JWT not suffice?<br><br>&nbsp;  contains information about the subject (for example, a user or an<br>&nbsp;  agent) that MAY be used to verify the signed JWT.&nbsp; If the received<br>&nbsp;  signed JWT contains a Subject claim, then any JWT subsequently<br>&nbsp;  generated for CDNI redirection MUST also contain a Subject claim, and<br>&nbsp;  the Subject value MUST be the same as in the received signed JWT.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Strict value equivalence seems problematic (given that we mandate<br>compact-form JWE), since there is a key (re)distribution problem for<br>making the information usable to any dCDN that is involved.&nbsp; If it's<br>encrypted using a symmetric key, then the uCDN sharing it to the dCDN<br>introduces the same issue as for "signed" JWTs -- the dCDN can<br>impersonate the CSP; if it's using an asymmetric key then the set of<br>recipients is fixed at JWE creation (by the CSP) and we either lose the<br>ability to seamlessly add CDN tiers or have to redistribute the private<br>key (which is against best practices), in order to meet the "byte for<br>byte the same value" requirement.&nbsp; What motivates the prohibition of<br>re-encrypting for the next level of hierarchy?&nbsp; I think that in the JWT<br>convention we could say that the "the Subject identified by the value of the<br>'sub' claim in any JWT subsequently generated for CDNI redirection MUST be<br>the same as the Subject identified by the value of the 'sub' claim in the<br>received signed JWT" to achieve a requirement that the information content<br>remain unchanged, without requiring strict value equivalence.<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Audience (aud) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.3<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; This claim is used to ensure that the CDN<br>&nbsp;  verifying the JWT is an intended recipient of the request.&nbsp; The claim<br>&nbsp;  MUST contain an identity on behalf of whom the CDN can verify the<br>&nbsp;  token (e.g., the CSP or any CDN in the chain).&nbsp; A CDN MAY modify the<br>&nbsp;  claim as long it can generate a valid signature.<br><br>While a setup that naively translates JWT semantics to the CDNI case would<br>have the CSP issue a JWT with Audience of the uCDN (or some meta-Audience<br>for the combination of uCDN and dCDN), and then either the uCDN would<br>re-sign with the dCDN as the Audience or the dCDN would be configured to<br>recognize the Audience used by the CSP as being valid for itself, I think I<br>see what is intended here, that the CSP issues a JWT with Audience that<br>corresponds to the request as targeted to the CSP and ultimately ending up<br>at one or more CDNs.&nbsp; That is, the CDNs know what CSP a given request is<br>supposed to come from, and can match the audience value against the CSP's<br>identification or an upstream CDN in addition to its own identification.&nbsp; In<br>that case, I would suggest rewording to something like "The claim MUST<br>contain an identity belonging to the chain of entities involved in<br>processing the request (e.g., identifying the CSP or any CDN in the chain)<br>that the recipient is configured to use for the processing of this request".<br><br>Section 2.1.7<br><br>I think we need to make some statement (not necessarily here) about whether<br>the JWT ID used in JWTs issued by token renewal use the same or different<br>JWT IDs.&nbsp; Currently we don't seem to say anything, and that seems likely to<br>lead to interoperability issues.<br><br>Section 2.1.9<br><br>It might be worth asking the OAuth WG if there's seen to be value in<br>having a generic "crit" claim that protocols can require comprehension<br>of, to hold a list of claims that are critical for that token in that<br>protocol.<br><br>Section 2.1.10<br><br>[same comments about encryption as for Subject]<br><br>Section 2.1.12<br><br>Can we give any guidance on what kind of values might make sense for the<br>CDNI Expiration Time Setting field and still providing some reasonable<br>security properties?&nbsp; (Conversely, what kind of values are so large so<br>as to be nonsensical?)<br><br>Section 2.1.14<br><br>The first two paragraphs seem to talk about this claim as being a<br>direction to the client of when to send such a token along with a<br>request, but the third paragraph seems to talk about it as being a<br>direction to the CDN for generating new tokens as part of Signed Token<br>Renewal.&nbsp; This leaves me confused about what the intended usage actually<br>is.<br><br>Section 2.1.15<br><br>&nbsp;  The URI Container (cdniuc) claim takes one of the following forms:<br>&nbsp;  'hash:' or 'regex:'.&nbsp; More forms may be added in the future to extend<br>&nbsp;  the capabilities.<br><br>How will a JWT producer know whether a JWT consumer knows about any such<br>extended functionality?<br><br>Section 2.1.15.2<br><br>&nbsp;  An example of a 'regex:' is the following:<br><br>&nbsp; [^:]*\\://[^/]*/folder/content/quality_[^/]*/segment.{3}\\.mp4(\\?.*)?<br><br>It seems a bit surprising to just do a wildcard match on scheme and<br>assume that the path components will be meaningful for that scheme.<br>Perhaps a variation that used branches to match only http or https<br>schemes would be preferred?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Property: issuers<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Description: A list of valid Issuers against which the Issuer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  claim in the signed JWT may be cross-referenced.<br><br>Cross-referencing or verifying against the JWT issuer is only part of<br>verifying a JWT; there needs to also be a binding between Issuer and key(s)<br>used to sign JWTs.&nbsp; I think we should say something here about how the<br>Issuer/key binding is tracked, since it is apparently not part of the CDNI<br>metadata interface.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Property: jwt-header<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Description: The header part of JWT that is used for verifying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a signed JWT when the JWT token in the URI Signing Package does<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  not contain a header part.<br><br>To me, "the header part of [a] JWT" would mean the base64-encoded version.<br>The example below uses a native JSON object.&nbsp; I strongly suggest being more<br>precise about what this property is supposed to contain.&nbsp; (Also,<br><a href="/doc/rfc8519/">RFC 8519</a> does not use the phrase "JWT header", and refers only to the "JOSE<br>header".)<br><br>&nbsp;  The following is an example of a URI Signing metadata payload with<br>&nbsp;  explicit values:<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "generic-metadata-type": "MI.UriSigning"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "generic-metadata-value":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "enforce": true,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "issuers": ["csp", "ucdn1", "ucdn2"],<br><br>It might be more helpful to use the URI form of the Issuer names, since<br>in this generic RFC we do not have any deployment-specific context that<br>would allow the use of a short string issuer identifier.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp;  CSP provides to the uCDN the information needed to verify Signed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JWTs from that CSP.&nbsp; For example, this information will include<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one or more keys used for validation.<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp;  Using the CDNI Metadata interface, the uCDN communicates to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dCDN the information needed to verify Signed JWTs from the CSP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br><br>Thanks for making changes so that the phrasing in this section more closely<br>matches the phrasing of the previous section!&nbsp; It looks like the previous<br>section switched from "Signed JWTs" here to "signed URIs", so we might need<br>to catch up (twice).<br><br>Appendix A.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the server verifies the signed JWT it will return a new signed<br>&nbsp;  JWT with an updated expiry time (exp) as shown below.&nbsp; Note the<br>&nbsp;  expiry time is increased by the expiration time setting (cdniets)<br>&nbsp;  value.<br><br>My previous comment was:<br>===<br>This example is adding the "cdniets" value to the previous "exp" value,<br>but the specification for this claim says that it is added to the "time<br>at which the JWT is verified", which is unlikely to be exactly the<br>previous "exp" value.&nbsp; I suggest adding a few words about this and using<br>a different (earlier) "exp" in the re-signing example.<br>===<br>It looks like the update to use more-current "exp" values has caused the<br>"add the 'cdniets' value" step to be skipped, so that the two "exp" values<br>are identical.&nbsp;

I've tried to suppress duplicates but no doubt have<br>missed a few; sorry for the extra work and feel free to just reference<br>some other discussions instead of repeating their contents.<br><br>Please don't refer to the "jti" claim as a "Nonce".&nbsp; There is a separate<br>registered "nonce" JWT claim that plays a different role, and mixing up<br>the terminology is confusing, even if the JWT ID value can be used as a<br>nonce in some circumstances (but not all).<br><br>Please reference (and act on, if/as appropriate) the JWT BCP (<a href="/doc/rfc8725/">RFC 8725</a>).<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Specifically, the CDNI Framework [<a href="/doc/rfc7336/">RFC7336</a>] states:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The CSP may also trust the CDN operator to perform actions such as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delegating traffic to additional downstream CDNs, and to enforce<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; per-request authorization performed by the CSP using techniques<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as URI Signing.<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, the following requirement is listed in the CDNI<br>&nbsp;  Requirements [<a href="/doc/rfc7337/">RFC7337</a>]:<br><br>(editorial) It reads a bit oddly to have both a "specifically" and an<br>"in particular"; the second line might be reframed as more of an<br>"additionally" or "also" type remark.<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A CSP and CDN are assumed to have a trust relationship that enables<br>&nbsp;  the CSP to authorize access to a content item by including a set of<br>&nbsp;  claims in the form of a signed JWT in the URI before redirecting a UA<br>&nbsp;  to the CDN.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit/editorial: the trust relationship is what enables the authorization<br>of access, but using claims in a signed JWT to effectuate that is more<br>of an implementation agreement that builds on the trust relationship<br>than an aspect of the trust relationship itself.&nbsp; So this could be<br>"enables the CSP to authorize access to a content item, which is<br>realized in practice by including a set of claims in a signed JWT", or<br>similar.<br><br>Section 1.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In step #3, the UA may send an HTTP request or a<br>&nbsp;  DNS request.&nbsp; Depending on whether HTTP-based or DNS-based request<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp;  Regardless of the type of keys<br>&nbsp;  used, the verifying entity has to obtain the key (either the public<br>&nbsp;  or the symmetric key).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Not just obtain the key, but obtain it in a manner that allows trust to<br>be placed in the assertions made using that key.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; URI Signing Package (URISigningPackage): The URI attribute that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulates all the URI Signing claims in a signed JWT encoded<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; format.&nbsp; This attribute is exposed in the Signed URI as a path-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; style parameter or a form-style parameter.<br><br>Is there a good reference for "URI attribute"?&nbsp; It sounds like should be<br>a technical term but I couldn't find a clear definition.<br><br>&nbsp;  The URI Signing Package will be found by parsing any path-style<br>&nbsp;  parameters and form-style parameters looking for a key name matching<br>&nbsp;  the URI Signing Package Attribute.&nbsp; Both parameter styles MUST be<br>&nbsp;  supported to allow flexibility of operation.&nbsp; The first matching<br>&nbsp;  parameter SHOULD be taken to provide the signed JWT, though providing<br>&nbsp;  more than one matching key is undefined behavior.<br><br>Shouldn't the metadata specify which parameter style is going to be<br>used?&nbsp; (Perhaps two, rather than one, new values for cdnistt?)<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The following claims (where the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry<br>&nbsp;  claim name is specified in parenthesis below) are used to enforce the<br>&nbsp;  distribution policies.&nbsp; All of the listed claims are mandatory to<br>&nbsp;  implement in a URI Signing implementation, but are not mandatory to<br>&nbsp;  use in a given signed JWT.&nbsp; (The "optional" and "mandatory"<br>&nbsp;  identifiers in square brackets refer to whether or not a given claim<br>&nbsp;  MUST be present in a URI Signing JWT.)<br><br>The final parenthetical suggests that the previous sentence should read<br>"not necessarily mandatory to use" (since apparently some of them *are*<br>mandatory to use).&nbsp; Though I do see this was noted by Roman as well.&nbsp; I<br>would be interested to hear why cdniuc is not mandatory (see below)...<br><br>&nbsp;  Note: The time on the entities that generate and verify the signed<br>&nbsp;  URI SHOULD be in sync.&nbsp; In the CDNI case, this means that CSP, uCDN,<br>&nbsp;  and dCDN servers need to be time-synchronized.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED to<br>&nbsp;  use NTP [<a href="/doc/rfc5905/">RFC5905</a>] for time synchronization.<br><br>It's surprising that this is only a SHOULD-level requirement for time<br>synchronization, given the scope of issues that can result if time is<br>not synchronized.&nbsp; When would it be okay to ignore the SHOULD?<br><br>Also, separately, I note that <a href="/doc/rfc8915/">RFC 8915</a> presents Network Time Security<br>for NTP, which might be a helpful reference (and, arguably, worth<br>recommending in its own right).<br><br>Section 2.1.x<br><br>In general, my stance is that it's redundant to say that "the semantics<br>in Section X of <a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC 7519</a> MUST be followed", because that's inherent in<br>the definition of the JWT claim.&nbsp; But you're free to write the text as<br>you wish.<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Issuer (iss) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.1<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; This claim MAY be used to verify authorization of<br>&nbsp;  the issuer of a signed JWT and also MAY be used to confirm that the<br>&nbsp;  indicated key was provided by said issuer.&nbsp; If the CDN verifying the<br><br>What is meant by "to verify authorization of the issuer of a signed<br>JWT"?&nbsp; In some sense, the "iss" claim is meaningless unless the JWT<br>signature is validated as having been generated by a trusted key<br>associated that belongs to the "iss" identity (or the JWT was received<br>on a trusted channel, which of course does not apply here since it's via<br>the UA).&nbsp; (Also note that the JWT BCP (<a href="/doc/rfc8725/">RFC 8725</a>) has some things to say<br>about when to use "iss" and how that relates to whether a given key is<br>used in more than one context...)<br><br>&nbsp;  signed JWT does not support Issuer verification, or if the Issuer in<br><br>I think this is intended to be "If an Issuer claim is present and the<br>CDN verifying the signed JWT [...]".<br><br>&nbsp;  the signed JWT does not match the list of known acceptable Issuers,<br>&nbsp;  the CDN MUST reject the request.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think this list also needs to include "if the Issuer claim does not<br>match the key used to sign the JWT".<br><br>Section 2.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Subject (sub) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.2<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; If this claim is used, it MUST be a JSON Web<br>&nbsp;  Encryption (JWE [<a href="/doc/rfc7516/">RFC7516</a>]) Object in compact serialization form,<br>&nbsp;  because it contains personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This claim<br><br>While I am happy to see that the subject information is recognized as<br>PII and required to be protected, it seems that this formulation is<br>over-constrained.&nbsp; Why does the Subject specifically need to be<br>compact-serialization-form JWE, as opposed to some other encrypted form<br>(that cannot be correlated to other instances of the same encrypted<br>Subject?&nbsp; Why does just using a signed-and-encrypted JWT for the<br>containing JWT not suffice?<br><br>&nbsp;  contains information about the subject (for example, a user or an<br>&nbsp;  agent) that MAY be used to verify the signed JWT.&nbsp; If the received<br>&nbsp;  signed JWT contains a Subject claim, then any JWT subsequently<br>&nbsp;  generated for CDNI redirection MUST also contain a Subject claim, and<br>&nbsp;  the Subject value MUST be the same as in the received signed JWT.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Strict value equivalence seems problematic (given that we mandate<br>compact-form JWE), since there is a key (re)distribution problem for<br>making the information usable to any dCDN that is involved.&nbsp; If it's<br>encrypted using a symmetric key, then the uCDN sharing it to the dCDN<br>introduces the same issue as for "signed" JWTs -- the dCDN can<br>impersonate the CSP; if it's using an asymmetric key then the set of<br>recipients is fixed at JWE creation (by the CSP) and we either lose the<br>ability to seamlessly add CDN tiers or have to redistribute the private<br>key (which is against best practices), in order to meet the "byte for<br>byte the same value" requirement.&nbsp; What motivates the prohibition of<br>re-encrypting for the next level of hierarchy?<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Audience (aud) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.3<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; This claim is used to ensure that the CDN verifing<br>&nbsp;  the JWT is an intended recipient of the request.&nbsp; The claim should<br>&nbsp;  contain an identity on behalf of whom the CDN can verify the token<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., the CSP or any uCDN in the chain).&nbsp; A dCDN MAY modify the<br>&nbsp;  claim as long it can generate a valid signature.<br><br>While <a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC 7519</a> does say that "[t]he processing of this claim is<br>generally application specific", the description here doesn't seem to<br>make a whole lot of sense.&nbsp; It's supposed to be used by the entity<br>receiving the JWT, which is never going to be the CSP (which generates<br>the JWT).&nbsp; My intuition is that typically the CSP would issue a JWT with<br>Audience of the uCDN (or some meta-Audience for the combination of uCDN<br>and dCDN), and then either the uCDN would re-sign with the dCDN as the<br>Audience or the dCDN would be configured to recognize the Audience used<br>by the CSP as being valid for itself.<br><br>Also, "the Audience used by the CSP" is perhaps ambiguous as to whether<br>that's the one inserted by the CSP or recognized by the CSP as being<br>itself.&nbsp; So maybe "recognize the Audience inserted in the JWT by the<br>CSP"?<br><br>Section 2.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Expiry Time (exp) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>]<br>&nbsp;  Section 4.1.4 MUST be followed, though URI Signing implementations<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT allow for any time synchronization "leeway".&nbsp; If the CDN<br><br>Why do we have "MUST NOT allow for any [leeway]" when it's only<br>RECOMMENDED to have synchronized time?<br><br>&nbsp;  verifying the signed JWT does not support Expiry Time verification,<br><br>As above, I think this is meant to be "If the Expiry Time claim is<br>present and the CDN verifying [...]".<br><br>&nbsp;  or if the Expiry Time in the signed JWT corresponds to a time equal<br>&nbsp;  to or earlier than the time of the content request, the CDN MUST<br>&nbsp;  reject the request.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Section 2.1.5<br><br>[conceptually same comments as for §2.1.4, adjusted for the "nbf" claim]<br><br>Section 2.1.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Issued At (iat) [optional] - The semantics in [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] Section 4.1.6<br>&nbsp;  MUST be followed.&nbsp; If the received signed JWT contains an Issued At<br>&nbsp;  claim, then any JWT subsequently generated for CDNI redirection MUST<br>&nbsp;  also contain an Issued At claim, and the Issuer value MUST be updated<br><br>nit: s/Issuer value/Issued At value/<br><br>Section 2.1.7<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the signed JWT contains a Nonce claim and the CDN<br>&nbsp;  verifying the signed JWT either does not support Nonce storage or has<br>&nbsp;  previously seen the Nonce used in a request for the same content,<br>&nbsp;  then the CDN MUST reject the request.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As above, this seems predicated on the "jti" claim being present in a<br>received token.<br><br>Section 2.1.9<br><br>It might be worth asking the OAuth WG if there's seen to be value in<br>having a generic "crit" claim that protocols can require comprehension<br>of, to hold a list of claims that are critical for that token in that<br>protocol.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If any of the listed extension claims are<br>&nbsp;  not understood and supported by the recipient, then the Signed JWT is<br>&nbsp;  invalid.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(editorial) In the other sections we seem to use language about "MUST<br>reject the request" or "MUST reject the JWT" rather than just saying<br>that the JWT "is invalid"<br><br>Section 2.1.10<br><br>[same comments about encryption as for Subject]<br><br>Section 2.1.11<br><br>Why is the CDNI URI Container claim optional?&nbsp; It seems like the URI<br>Signing cannot be fit for purpose if the URI being signed is not<br>contained in the token...<br><br>Section 2.1.12<br><br>Can we give any guidance on what kind of values might make sense for the<br>CDNI Expiration Time Setting field and still providing some reasonable<br>security properties?&nbsp; (Conversely, what kind of values are so large so<br>as to be nonsensical?)<br><br>Section 2.1.14<br><br>The first two paragraphs seem to talk about this claim as being a<br>direction to the client of when to send such a token along with a<br>request, but the third paragraph seems to talk about it as being a<br>direction to the CDN for generating new tokens as part of Signed Token<br>Renewal.&nbsp; This leaves me confused about what the intended usage actually<br>is.<br><br>Section 2.1.15<br><br>&nbsp;  The URI Container (cdniuc) claim takes one of the following forms:<br>&nbsp;  'hash:' or 'regex:'.&nbsp; More forms may be added in the future to extend<br>&nbsp;  the capabilities.<br><br>How will a JWT producer know whether a JWT consumer knows about any such<br>extended functionality?<br><br>Section 2.1.15.2<br><br>&nbsp;  An example of a 'regex:' is the following:<br><br>&nbsp; [^:]*\\://[^/]*/folder/content/quality_[^/]*/segment.{3}\\.mp4(\\?.*)?<br><br>It seems a bit surprising to just do a wildcard match on scheme and<br>assume that the path components will be meaningful for that scheme.<br>Perhaps a variation that used branches to match only http or https<br>schemes would be preferred?<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  this document.&nbsp; However, in order to also support legacy UAs that do<br>&nbsp;  not include any specific provisions for the handling of signed JWTs,<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.3 defines a mechanism using HTTP Cookies [<a href="/doc/rfc6265/">RFC6265</a>] that<br>&nbsp;  allows such UAs to support the concept of renewing signed JWTs<br>&nbsp;  without requiring any additional UA support.<br><br>(editorial) the way this sentence is written suggests that the §3.3<br>cookie-based mechanism is distinct from the mechanism described here<br>(most notably due to the use of the word "also"), but it looks like the<br>mechanism described here also uses cookies.&nbsp; Are the two actually<br>distinct?<br><br>Section 3.2.1<br><br>(editorial) typically we don't use second-person language ("you") in RFC<br>style.<br><br>Section 3.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In such scenarios, Signed Token Renewal of a signed JWT SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  communicated via the query string instead, in a similar fashion to<br>&nbsp;  how regular signed JWTs (outside of Signed Token Renewal) are<br>&nbsp;  communicated.&nbsp; Note that the use of URL embedded signed JWTs SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  NOT be used in HTTP 2xx Successful messages, since UAs might not know<br>&nbsp;  how to extract the signed JWTs.<br><br>I don't think I understand how (in the last sentence) a URL embedded<br>signed JWT would be used in an HTTP 2xx response, since the response<br>would just be normal application content and there's not a particularly<br>well-defined place to put a URL with embedded JWT.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  necessary to allow the dCDN to verify a Signed URI.&nbsp; Events that<br>&nbsp;  pertain to URI Signing (e.g., request denial or delivery after access<br>&nbsp;  authorization) need to be included in the logs communicated through<br>&nbsp;  the CDNI Logging interface.<br><br>(editorial) I don't think I understand what is meant by "e.g., request<br>denial or delivery after access authorization".&nbsp; I'm not even 100% sure<br>if I'm supposed to group thing as "(request denial or delivery) (after<br>access authorization)" or "(request denial) or (delivery after access<br>authorization)".&nbsp; My initial thought was the latter, but "delivery after<br>access authorization" really doesn't make much sense to me; my current<br>thinking is that it's the former and that s/after access<br>authorization/after an access authorization decision has been made/<br>would clarify.<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Property: issuers<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Description: A list of valid Issuers against which the Issuer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  claim in the signed JWT may be verified.<br><br>Issuers should always be tied to keys that they control.&nbsp; Leaving keys<br>and issuer identities to be managed separately invites identity<br>misbinding attacks.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Property: package-attribute<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Description: The name to use for the URI Signing Package.<br><br>(nit?) Should this be "The attribute name to use"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Property: jwt-header<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Description: The header part of JWT that is used for generating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  or verifying a signed JWT when the JWT token in the URI Signing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Package does not contain a header part.<br><br>(editorial) IIUC this metadata interface is for the uCDN to provide<br>information to the dCDN that the dCDN will use for processing requests<br>(i.e., in this case, for verifying JWTs).&nbsp; In that context, I don't see<br>how it's useful to say that this is the header part of the JWT "that is<br>used for generating", since the dCDN only needs to verify these JWTs.<br>If the dCDN is issuing its own JWTs when acting as an uCDN in a<br>hierarchy, it can list its own jwt-header in its own published metadata.<br><br>&nbsp;  The following is an example of a URI Signing metadata payload with<br>&nbsp;  explicit values:<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "generic-metadata-type": "MI.UriSigning"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "generic-metadata-value":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "enforce": true,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "issuers": ["csp", "ucdn1", "ucdn2"],<br><br>It might be more helpful to use the URI form of the Issuer names, since<br>in this generic RFC we do not have any deployment-specific context that<br>would allow the use of a short string issuer identifier.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  URI Signing supports both HTTP-based and DNS-based request routing.<br>&nbsp;  JSON Web Token (JWT) [<a href="/doc/rfc7519/">RFC7519</a>] defines a compact, URL-safe means of<br>&nbsp;  representing claims to be transferred between two parties.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  claims in a signed JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as<br>&nbsp;  the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the<br>&nbsp;  plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the<br>&nbsp;  claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message<br>&nbsp;  Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.<br><br>AFAICT this is the only place in the document where we refer to a<br>possibility of using JWE over the entire JWT (as opposed to just the<br>Subject or IP address claim bodies).&nbsp; Yes, this is in some sense a<br>generic statement about JWT and not necessarily attempting to apply to<br>the URI Signing usage of JWT, but it still seems out of place.&nbsp; I would<br>have expected that we just stick to talking about JWS (or, I suppose,<br>that JWE was mentioned consistently throughout, but it doesn't seem to<br>be a great fit for this application anyway).<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp;  CSP provides to the uCDN the information needed to verify signed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JWTs from that CSP.&nbsp; For example, this information may include a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; key value.<br><br>When would it not include a key value?<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp;  Using the CDNI Metadata interface, the uCDN communicates to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dCDN the information needed to verify signed JWTs from the uCDN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the given CSP.&nbsp; For example, this information may include<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the URI query string parameter name for the URI Signing Package<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attribute.<br><br>It would also include key material if the uCDN is re-signing, right?<br>So either we should mention key material here or change (9) to not<br>mention "computes".<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp;  When a UA requests a piece of protected content from the CSP,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the CSP makes a specific authorization decision for this unique<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request based on its personal distribution policy.<br><br>(nit) I'd suggest s/personal/local/, since the CSP is typically not a<br>person.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp;  CSP provides to the uCDN the information needed to verify<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cryptographic signatures from that CSP.&nbsp; For example, this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; information may include a key.<br><br>As above, when would this not include a key value?<br><br>&nbsp;

there are several differences that appear when I run a diff,<br>including "Signed URI" vs "cryptographic signature" or "signed JWTs" vs<br>"cryptographic signatures".<br><br>&nbsp;  12.&nbsp; If the verification is negative, the dCDN rejects the request<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sends an error code 403 Forbidden in the HTTP response.<br><br>&nbsp;  13.&nbsp; If the verification is positive, the dCDN serves the request and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delivers the content.<br><br>(nit) I'd suggest "verification result" both here and above.<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  is a 3DIGIT value as defined in Section 4.5.&nbsp; Additions to the CDNI<br>&nbsp;

Ma<br><br>Responsible AB: Barry Leiba<br><br>This document defines a standard for URI signing to enable interoperability between interconnected CDNs.&nbsp; We are requesting publication as "Proposed Standard" as we feel it has been extensively reviewed and vetted by the WG.&nbsp; The draft has undergone significant rewrite multiple times as a result of the reviews and implementations.&nbsp; There are commercial implementations, as well as interest and review by other SDOs (e.g., the Streaming Video Alliance and the MPEG WG, see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1413/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1413/</a>).&nbsp; During the most recent rewrite, over the course of many IETFs, the authors, interested parties, and WG discussed all aspects of the switch to JWT.&nbsp; In the more recent revisions, non-editorial changes were primarily the result of implementation findings.&nbsp; At this point, the WG feels that the document is mature and complete.<br><br>The document originally went to WGLC in July 2016.&nbsp; In an pre-sec-dir review, Matt Miller had "reinventing the wheel" (more specifically, reinventing crypto wheels by non-security folks) concerns (see <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cdni/3xTSo1OzQyFf6ky8gj8kMxPTU1Q/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cdni/3xTSo1OzQyFf6ky8gj8kMxPTU1Q/</a>).&nbsp; At that time, it was decided to rewrite the draft to rely on JWT for the security aspects.&nbsp; This greatly simplified the security aspects of the draft to specifying just the JWT claims needed to implement the CDNI security policies.<br><br>There are known security limitations with URI signing, and they are documented in the Introduction and Security Considerations sections.&nbsp; If used responsibly for its intended purpose, URI signing serves a specific function providing basic access control, useful in protecting the CDN itself (though not necessarily the content being served by the CDN).&nbsp; Though these limitations are often misunderstood by or misrepresented to content owners, URI signing is widely used for its intended (stated) purpose by network operators.&nbsp; Because of this wide use, the WG feels that standardizing URI signing is important for interoperability.<br><br>As Matt Miller was deeply involved in the rewrite, the WG feels that the security aspects should be well vetted at this point.<br><br>The other major change since the original WGLC was the inclusion of Token Renewal for HTTP Addaptive Streaming (HAS).&nbsp; Originally, the WG decided to avoid HAS in all WG documents, because we could not come to a concensus on how to address it, and there was concern that a lot of IPR would be implicated.&nbsp; For URI signing, an IPR disclosure was made on HAS related conten (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2603/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2603/</a>), and the WG decided to split out the IPR encumbered portion at IETF-93 (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/cdni/minutes?item=minutes-93-cdni.html">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/cdni/minutes?item=minutes-93-cdni.html</a>).&nbsp; The IPR disclosure was subsequently updated (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2806/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2806/</a>) removing the royalties and the WG decided to re-incorporate the IPR encumbered portion at IETF-96 (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/cdni/minutes?item=minutes-96-cdni.html">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/cdni/minutes?item=minutes-96-cdni.html</a>).<br><br>Because HAS has become such a significant portion of CDN traffic, the WG felt that HAS support was important to include and the updated IPR terms were deemed acceptable.<br><br>The authors have confirmed that there is no other known undisclosed IPR related to the contents of this document.<br><br>There are no downward references in the document, and I agree with the normative vs informative reference designations.&nbsp; I suppose it could be argued that the CDNI problem statement and requirements documents are normative to URI Signing's purpose, but they don't really affect the protocol specifics so they are listed as informative.&nbsp; Similarly, the reference to the CDNI Request Routing interface, only used to say that there is no dependency on the CDNI Request Routing interface also seems fine as non-normative.<br><br>This document registers a new CDNI Payload Type in our IANA registry, for the purpose of identifying URI Signing CDNI Metadata and advertising URI Signing CDNI Capabilities.&nbsp; This is inline with the intended purpose of the registry.&nbsp; I am the creator of and one of the two expert reviewers for that registry and approve of this registration.<br><br>This document registers a new CDNI Logging Record Type and two associated CDNI Logging Field Names.&nbsp; These registrations are inline with the intended extensibility design of CDNI Logging.&nbsp; I am&nbsp; one of the two expert reviewers for these registries and approve of this registration.<br><br>This document registers seven new claims in the JSON Web Token Claims registry.&nbsp; The authors have discussed the registrations with Brian Campbell, one of the Expert reviewers for the JSON Web Token Claims registry, and he approved of the registrations.<br><br>This document creates two new IANA registries: the CDNI URI Signing Verification Code registry and the CDNI URI Signing Signed Token Transport registry.&nbsp; Both registries are defined as Specification Required.<br><br>The CDNI URI Signing Verification Code registry is for registering error codes reported in CDNI logs.&nbsp; URI Signing allows for extension claims to be defined in the future.&nbsp; The error codes correspond one-to-one with claims.&nbsp; Though future extensions would likely be defined in RFCs, and new error codes could be defined in those RFCs, a registry seemed like a better way to prevent overlapping or duplicate error codes.<br><br>The CDNI URI Signing Signed Token Transport registry is for registering valid values for the CDNI Signed Token Transport claim.&nbsp; There are only two values initially defined: none and cookie.&nbsp; The intent of the registry is to allow for future extensibility.&nbsp; Though cookies were the proposed implementation for HAS support, the WG did not wanted to assume cookies would always be the best solution.<br><br></div></td>
