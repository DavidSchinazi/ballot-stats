I'm choosing to abstain because I'm not happy with the outcome of #2 and especially #3; however I won't stand in the way of the document's advancement for these reasons.<br><br>---previous discuss, for posterity:<br><br>I’ve done an initial review of this document and have several concerns I’d like to discuss. I apologize for not also providing a full review as comments in this ballot, I judged it more important to begin the discussion about these points timely, than to provide all comments in a single message. <br><br>1. The shepherd writeup indicates that “Standard Track is requested and indicated in the title page header. This is appropriate for a specification of packet steering into an SR policy needing interoperability between the ingress/source of the policy instantiation and the egress/destination of the policy termination.”   <br><br>I realize it’s unusual to ask to discuss a shepherd writeup rather than the spec itself, but I think this one rises to the level. My concern is that this description (needing interoperability between the ingress and the egress) doesn’t comport with my understanding of the Segment Routing architecture. Surely, one of the key value propositions of SR is that it’s stateless everywhere other than the headend? Indeed, that’s stated in the abstract. SR doesn’t require the egress to even understand that it IS an egress of a SR Policy, it just does what the headers tell it to, right?<br><br>If that's so, then the rationale given for the requested track must be wrong. :-( And that in turn leads me to ask, whether the track really is right. It seems to me that in most respects this is more an Informational document than a standards track one. That’s not a value judgement in any respect, just a statement of fact — for the most part, it doesn’t seem as though the information found in this document is needed in order to interoperate with another system. (Section 8.8 is an exception, I discuss that separately.)  <br><br>Anyway, not to get too far ahead of myself, let’s start by working on this question: is the shepherd writeup correct in saying that interoperability between headend and tailend is required? If so, can someone please characterize the nature of that interoperability, and put it in the context of SR’s stateless nature?<br><br>2. It seems to me an unusual practice for this document to be defining semantics and even reserving values in a field allocated by a different document, by a different WG. I’m referring here to the so-called “‘Color-Only’ bits” discussed in Section 8.8.   <br><br>- I would be more comfortable if the work were all done in one place, to the extent possible.<br><br>- Given the fact this document is reaching in to a registry normally managed by IDR, was there any discussion with the IDR group? I don't see any evidence of a courtesy notification of the last call when I look at the IDR mailing list archive. <br><br>I’ve also emailed the IDR list about this in connection with <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a>, see <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/idr/yCcZdStmTR-FLUYGHTsLLBv5aWo/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/idr/yCcZdStmTR-FLUYGHTsLLBv5aWo/</a>  <br><br>Relating this back to my previous question, it’s evident that if this document is going to define semantics for the Color Extended Community Flags, then that makes it Standards Track because there is an interoperability factor to take into account (that's been imported from IDR). A more ideal solution would be to take care of that in the IDR document rather than putting it in this “architecture” document, though. Surely, this kind of detail is implementation, not architecture?  Indeed, Ketan said in his reply to Matthew Bocci's RTG review, "Given that this is an architecture document, it describes the architecture and not really the protocol mechanisms"... but this section seems to be an exception to that aspiration.<br><br>3. Related to the above, at least one of the references listed as informational clearly has to be normative with the document as it stands. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> is the one I’m thinking of, for example its use in §2.4 seems like it may rise to the "normative" level, §2.5 almost surely does, §4.1 surely does, and §8.8.1 is the icing on the cake because this document defines semantics for a field that isn’t even allocated until and unless <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> is published. <br><br>4. In §2.1 you talk about the signaling of symbolic names for candidate paths. Although you are careful to say that such symbolic names are only used for presentation purposes, it seems to me they still could be considered a new potential source of vulnerability, since a string that has no sanity-checking whatsoever applied by the protocol can display literally anything to an operator viewing it. Shouldn’t this be addressed in your Security Considerations? (For an example of a related Security Considerations, see <a href="/doc/rfc9003/">RFC 9003</a>. It’s probably not the best example, but it’s the one I had at my fingertips…)<br><br>---comments:<br><br>As noted in my DISCUSS, these comments are unfinished but I thought I’d give you what I have.<br><br>1. I see that Cullen Jennings referred to this in his ART review, but I’d like to talk about it a little more: why have you chosen to restrict symbolic names to ASCII? UTF-8 is the more usual choice in this context; indeed implementations may have to go to extra effort to scrub their input to insure that only ASCII is present. <a href="/doc/bcp18/">BCP 18</a> doesn’t require you to internationalize your strings, of course, it gives you two options, of which you have (sort of, you don't have the "US-") followed the latter:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not mandate a policy on name internationalization,<br>&nbsp;  but requires that all protocols describe whether names are<br>&nbsp;  internationalized or US-ASCII.<br><br>But in 2022 the choice to restrict symbolic names to ASCII seems unusual enough to invite the question. <br><br>If you do stick with ASCII as currently written, might you add text mandating that implementations scrub their input to prevent non-ASCII characters from being accepted?</div></td>

I note in the<br>section-by-section comments several places where a term is first used<br>without sufficient background/definition, leaving the matter at hand<br>underspecified for the reader.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY allow the assignment of a symbolic name<br>&nbsp;  comprising printable ASCII [<a href="/doc/rfc20/">RFC0020</a>] characters (i.e.&nbsp; 0x20 to 0x7E)<br>&nbsp;  to an SR Policy to serve as a user-friendly attribute for debugging<br>&nbsp;  and troubleshooting purposes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I agree with the other ADs that limiting to US-ASCII is not actually<br>user-friendly for many users, and that the likelihood of some<br>implementations not properly enforcing such a limitation to be high.<br>(Likewise for the other places where symbolic names are admitted.)<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A dynamic candidate path expresses an optimization objective and a<br>&nbsp;  set of constraints.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Down in §5.2 when we discuss validation procedures for dynamic candidate<br>paths, we say that the optimization problem is solved "for either the<br>SR-MPLS or the SRv6 data-plane as specified".&nbsp;

<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The Discriminator is a 32-bit value associated with a candidate path<br>&nbsp;  that uniquely identifies it within the context of an SR Policy from a<br>&nbsp;  specific Protocol-Origin as specified below:<br><br>What are the constraints that underlie the 32-bit requirement here?<br>It looks like some of the scenarios are going to involve uncoordinated<br>(random) assignment of these discriminator values (e.g., with the BGP<br>distribution mechanism, when coming from different BGP peers), and the<br>birthday-bound collision probability is not negligible for this few bits.<br>That, in turn, calls into question the "uniquely identifies" property being<br>claimed.&nbsp; Or is there some other property that means that only<br>discriminators from a single issuer will ever need to be compared with each<br>other (making the allocation "coordinated"), such as being additionally<br>associated with the originator?<br>If my initial analysis was incorrect and these are indeed allocated in a<br>"coordinated" fashion, would it be typical/expected for the allocation to<br>occur by incrementing a local counter on the originator?&nbsp;

 uses that BSID if this value (label in MPLS, IPv6 address in SRv6) is<br>&nbsp;  available (i.e., not associated with any other usage: e.g. to another<br>&nbsp;  MPLS client, to another SRv6 client, to another SID, to another SR<br>&nbsp;  Policy, outside the range of SRv6 Locators).<br><br>I don't think I understand what is meant by "client" here (for "another<br>client").&nbsp; This sentence is the only place where the word "client" appears<br>in this document...<br><br>&nbsp;  Optionally, instead of only checking that the BSID of the active path<br>&nbsp;  is available, a headend MAY check that it is available within a given<br>&nbsp;  SID range i.e., Segment Routing Local Block (SRLB) as specified in<br>&nbsp;

Please clarify.<br><br>Section 6.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY support the configuration of the Specified-<br>&nbsp;  BSID-only restrictive behavior on the headend for all SR Policies or<br>&nbsp;  individual SR Policies.&nbsp; Further, this restrictive behavior MAY also<br>&nbsp;  be signaled on a per SR Policy basis to the headend.<br><br>Elsewhere in the document we discuss specific potential signaling<br>mechanisms/protocols, but here we say nothing.&nbsp;

 The SR Policy state can be reported by the headend node via BGP-LS<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution/">I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution</a>] or PCEP [<a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC8231</a>] and<br>&nbsp;

in particular, the<br>former does not seem to actually report SR Policy state to the headed at<br>all; rather, it only concerns itself with BSID association to path, with no<br>information about "active", "not preferred", etc.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy P is invalid, the BSID B is not in the forwarding<br>&nbsp;  plane and hence the packet K is dropped by H.<br><br>We literally just in the previous section talked about a scenario where the<br>BSDI is kept in the forwarding plane (but with the action to drop, so the<br>overall outcome is not changed from what this text describes).&nbsp;

 valid SR Policy, the BGP process installs the route on the SR Policy<br>&nbsp;  giving preference to the color with the highest numerical value.<br><br>Do we want to say anything about this being an arbitrary tiebreaker (rather<br>than an intentional preference), or is that thought to be implicitly clear?<br><br>Section 8.6<br><br>&nbsp;

The index into the array is called<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Forwarding Class (FC).&nbsp; The index can have values 0 to 7.<br><br>Why are the only allowed values 0 to 7?&nbsp; Where does this restriction arise<br>from?&nbsp; It is because of some protocol element?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the local configuration does not specify any explicit forwarding<br>&nbsp;  information for an entry of the array, then this entry is filled with<br>&nbsp;  the same information as entry 0 (i.e. the IGP shortest path).<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy mapped to an entry of the array becomes invalid,<br>&nbsp;  then this entry is filled with the same information as entry 0.&nbsp; When<br>&nbsp;  all the array entries have the same information as entry0, the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding entry for N is updated to bypass the array and point<br>&nbsp;  directly to its outgoing interface and next-hop.<br><br>I can't tell how much of this is supposed to be protocol specification and<br>how much an illustrative example.&nbsp; Is A(0) always the IGP shortest path?<br>Are these protocol requirements to fall back to the IGP shortest path when<br>an entry is otherwise unpopulated or the associated SR Policy becomes<br>invalid?<br><br>Section 8.8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The steering preference is first based on the highest color value and<br>&nbsp;  then CO-dependent for the color.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems to contradict what I assumed earlier about the "highest color"<br>rule being a tiebreaker, e.g., the word "preference" is used here.&nbsp; Is it<br>actually intended to be a deliberately configured priority/preference<br>scheme?&nbsp; If so, that would seem to require some wide-ranging reworking<br>throughout the document.<br><br>Section 9.3<br><br>&nbsp;  the most appropriate alternative for the active candidate path.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  fast re-route mechanism MAY then be used to trigger sub 50msec<br>&nbsp;  switchover from the active to the backup candidate path in the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding plane.&nbsp; Mechanisms like Bidirectional Forwarding Detection<br>&nbsp;  (BFD) MAY be used for fast detection of such failures.<br><br>Why is the specific 50msec value important here?&nbsp; Is there some other<br>requirement that imposes it?<br><br>Section 15.2<br><br>I agree with John that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> must be<br>classified as a normative reference.</div></td>

I note in the<br>section-by-section comments several places where a term is first used<br>without sufficient background/definition, leaving the matter at hand<br>underspecified for the reader.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  An SR Policy is a framework that enables the instantiation of an<br>&nbsp;  ordered list of segments on a node for implementing a source routing<br><br>Really, an SR policy is a *framework*?&nbsp; I thought an SR policy was a<br>specific instantiation of a list of segments, or at least that's what I'm<br>getting from <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps we should say that the general concept of SR<br>Policy provides a framework?<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  An SR Policy MUST be identified through the tuple .&nbsp; In the context of a specific headend, an SR policy MUST<br>&nbsp;  be identified by the&nbsp; tuple.<br><br>These two MUSTs appear to be in (nominal) conflict.&nbsp; Maybe start the first<br>one with "absent further context" or "absent the context of a known headend<br>node"?<br><br>&nbsp;  The headend is the node where the policy is instantiated/implemented.<br>&nbsp;  The headend is specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 address and is expected<br>&nbsp;  to be unique in the domain.<br><br>This is the first instance of the word "domain" in this document.&nbsp; I suggest<br>using the introduction to introduce what is meant by the word, even if just<br>by reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY allow the assignment of a symbolic name<br>&nbsp;  comprising printable ASCII [<a href="/doc/rfc20/">RFC0020</a>] characters (i.e.&nbsp; 0x20 to 0x7E)<br>&nbsp;  to an SR Policy to serve as a user-friendly attribute for debugging<br>&nbsp;  and troubleshooting purposes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I agree with the other ADs that limiting to US-ASCII is not actually<br>user-friendly for many users, and that the likelihood of some<br>implementations not properly enforcing such a limitation to be high.<br>(Likewise for the other places where symbolic names are admitted.)<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A dynamic candidate path expresses an optimization objective and a<br>&nbsp;  set of constraints.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Down in §5.2 when we discuss validation procedures for dynamic candidate<br>paths, we say that the optimization problem is solved "for either the<br>SR-MPLS or the SRv6 data-plane as specified".&nbsp; Does the data plane need to<br>be specified as part of the dynamic candidate path itself?<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  in Section 2.9.&nbsp; The table below specifies the RECOMMENDED default<br>&nbsp;  values of Protocol-Origin:<br><br>I feel like it would be useful to provide some justification for why the<br>recommended default behavior prefers BGP SR configuration over PCEP, even if<br>that justification is just "we need to have a clear ordering and this one is<br>arbitrary".<br><br>Section 2.4<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Node Address : represented as a 128-bit value.&nbsp; IPv4 addresses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be encoded in the lowest 32 bits, and the high-order bits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be set to zero.<br><br>&nbsp;  Its application in the candidate path selection is described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 2.9.<br><br>The tie-breaker procedure for path selection described in §2.9 seems to<br>always prefer IPv4 originators over IPv6 ones (by virtue of preferring the<br>smaller value).&nbsp; I guess if we wanted to change that to prefer IPv6 we have<br>the option of fc00::/7 (unique-local) or fe80::/10 (link-scoped unicast)<br>from <a href="/doc/bcp153/">BCP 153</a>, but it's a bit hard to justify either of those as appropriate<br>on technical grounds, and since this is just a tie-breaker and the<br>Preference is explicitly preferred, it seems like this is probably "good<br>enough" as-is.<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The Discriminator is a 32-bit value associated with a candidate path<br>&nbsp;  that uniquely identifies it within the context of an SR Policy from a<br>&nbsp;  specific Protocol-Origin as specified below:<br><br>What are the constraints that underlie the 32-bit requirement here?<br>It looks like some of the scenarios are going to involve uncoordinated<br>(random) assignment of these discriminator values (e.g., with the BGP<br>distribution mechanism, when coming from different BGP peers), and the<br>birthday-bound collision probability is not negligible for this few bits.<br>That, in turn, calls into question the "uniquely identifies" property being<br>claimed.&nbsp; Or is there some other property that means that only<br>discriminators from a single issuer will ever need to be compared with each<br>other (making the allocation "coordinated"), such as being additionally<br>associated with the originator?<br>If my initial analysis was incorrect and these are indeed allocated in a<br>"coordinated" fashion, would it be typical/expected for the allocation to<br>occur by incrementing a local counter on the originator?&nbsp; In some situations<br>such allocation by counter can have security considerations, which<br><a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> attempts to cover.<br><br>Section 2.8<br><br>&nbsp;  A candidate path is usable when it is valid.&nbsp; A common path validity<br>&nbsp;  criterion is the validity of any of its constituent Segment-Lists.<br>&nbsp;  The validation rules are specified in Section 5.<br><br>This document claims to target Proposed Standard status; are we really<br>content to say only that this is "a common" criterion?&nbsp; Even when we also go<br>on to flat-out state "the validation rules are specified [below]"?<br><br>Section 2.9<br><br>&nbsp;  The candidate path selection process operates primarily on the<br>&nbsp;  candidate path Preference.&nbsp; A candidate path is selected when it is<br>&nbsp;  valid and it has the highest preference value among all the candidate<br>&nbsp;  paths of the SR Policy.<br><br>Should this be "among all the valid candidate paths"?&nbsp; A path that's invalid<br>is still invalid, even if it has the highest preference value.<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; If specified by configuration, prefer the existing installed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  path.<br><br>Does "if specified by configuration" refer to the act of applying this rule<br>at all, or that the existing installed path was one specified by<br>configuration?<br><br>Section 2.11<br><br>&nbsp;

 available (i.e., not associated with any other usage: e.g. to another<br>&nbsp;  MPLS client, to another SRv6 client, to another SID, to another SR<br>&nbsp;  Policy, outside the range of SRv6 Locators).<br><br>I don't think I understand what is meant by "client" here (for "another<br>client").&nbsp; This sentence is the only place where the word "client" appears<br>in this document...<br><br>&nbsp;  Optionally, instead of only checking that the BSID of the active path<br>&nbsp;  is available, a headend MAY check that it is available within a given<br>&nbsp;

Please clarify.<br><br>&nbsp;  Assuming that at time t the BSID of the SR Policy is B1, if at time<br>&nbsp;  t+dt a different candidate path becomes active and this new active<br>&nbsp;  path does not have a specified BSID or its BSID is specified but is<br>&nbsp;  not available (e.g. it is in use by something else), then the SR<br>&nbsp;  Policy MAY keep the previous BSID B1.<br><br>Is there a strict bound on or other guidance for what values of dt are<br>allowable for this purpose?&nbsp; Is the intent that there be an atomic<br>transition from BSID=B1;active-path=P1 to BSID=B1;active-path=P2?<br><br>&nbsp;  The association of an SR Policy with a BSID thus MAY change over the<br>&nbsp;  life of the SR Policy (e.g., upon active path change).&nbsp; Hence, the<br>&nbsp;  BSID SHOULD NOT be used as an identification of an SR Policy.<br><br>Is there any guidance available on how long to wait with a given BSID value<br>unused before binding it to a new SR Policy?<br><br>Section 6.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY support the configuration of the Specified-<br>&nbsp;  BSID-only restrictive behavior on the headend for all SR Policies or<br>&nbsp;  individual SR Policies.&nbsp; Further, this restrictive behavior MAY also<br>&nbsp;  be signaled on a per SR Policy basis to the headend.<br><br>Elsewhere in the document we discuss specific potential signaling<br>mechanisms/protocols, but here we say nothing.&nbsp; Is that vagueness<br>intentional?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A valid SR Policy installs a BSID-keyed entry in the forwarding plane<br>&nbsp;  with the action of steering the packets matching this entry to the<br>&nbsp;  selected path of the SR Policy.<br><br>I don't think this is stated properly.&nbsp; An SR Policy is the list of<br>segments; it isn't the entity that's installing entries in the forwarding<br>plane.&nbsp; Some other entity is installing an entry in the forwarding plane to<br>realize the SR Policy in question, and we should make our writing reflect<br>that.<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY choose to associate a Binding SID with any type<br>&nbsp;  of interface (e.g. a layer 3 termination of an Optical Circuit) or a<br>&nbsp;  tunnel (e.g.&nbsp; IP tunnel, GRE tunnel, IP/UDP tunnel, MPLS RSVP-TE<br>&nbsp;

 The SR Policy State is maintained on the headend to represent the<br>&nbsp;  state of the policy and its candidate paths.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I confess I don't really understand why we need to have the current,<br>minimal, description of SR Policy State in this document.&nbsp; What would be<br>lost if we deferred its discussion entirely until there is a more<br>comprehensive discussion available?<br><br>&nbsp;  The SR Policy state can be reported by the headend node via BGP-LS<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution/">I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution</a>] or PCEP [<a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC8231</a>] and<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid/">I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid</a>].<br><br>The functionality of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid/">draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid</a> seems much more<br>limited than that of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution/">draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution</a>; in particular, the<br>former does not seem to actually report SR Policy state to the headed at<br>all; rather, it only concerns itself with BSID association to path, with no<br>information about "active", "not preferred", etc.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy P is invalid, the BSID B is not in the forwarding<br>&nbsp;  plane and hence the packet K is dropped by H.<br><br>We literally just in the previous section talked about a scenario where the<br>BSDI is kept in the forwarding plane (but with the action to drop, so the<br>overall outcome is not changed from what this text describes).&nbsp; Nonetheless,<br>it's inaccurate to state that "the BSID B is not in the forwarding plane"<br>here.<br><br>Section 8.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When a BGP route has multiple Color Extended communities each with a<br>&nbsp;  valid SR Policy, the BGP process installs the route on the SR Policy<br>&nbsp;  giving preference to the color with the highest numerical value.<br><br>Do we want to say anything about this being an arbitrary tiebreaker (rather<br>than an intentional preference), or is that thought to be implicitly clear?<br><br>Section 8.5<br><br>&nbsp;  In this section, independent of the a-priori existence of any<br>&nbsp;  explicit candidate path of the SR policy (C, N), it is to be noted<br>&nbsp;  that the BGP process at headend node H triggers the instantiation of<br>&nbsp;  a dynamic candidate path for the SR policy (C, N) as soon as:<br><br>I strongly suggest providing a more explicit framework of what the<br>assumptions and preconditions are for the mechanism described in this<br>section.&nbsp; My intuition says that it's a fairly optional thing that would<br>need to be specifically configured, but trying to wrap that sentiment into<br>the long bullet point involving "a local policy" seems like a very confusing<br>way to express the desired behavior.<br><br>Section 8.6<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; is configured to instantiate an array of paths to N where the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entry 0 is the IGP path to N, color C1 is the first entry and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Color C2 is the second entry.&nbsp; The index into the array is called<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Forwarding Class (FC).&nbsp; The index can have values 0 to 7.<br><br>Why are the only allowed values 0 to 7?&nbsp; Where does this restriction arise<br>from?&nbsp; It is because of some protocol element?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the local configuration does not specify any explicit forwarding<br>&nbsp;  information for an entry of the array, then this entry is filled with<br>&nbsp;  the same information as entry 0 (i.e. the IGP shortest path).<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy mapped to an entry of the array becomes invalid,<br>&nbsp;  then this entry is filled with the same information as entry 0.&nbsp; When<br>&nbsp;  all the array entries have the same information as entry0, the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding entry for N is updated to bypass the array and point<br>&nbsp;  directly to its outgoing interface and next-hop.<br><br>I can't tell how much of this is supposed to be protocol specification and<br>how much an illustrative example.&nbsp; Is A(0) always the IGP shortest path?<br>Are these protocol requirements to fall back to the IGP shortest path when<br>an entry is otherwise unpopulated or the associated SR Policy becomes<br>invalid?<br><br>Section 8.8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The steering preference is first based on the highest color value and<br>&nbsp;  then CO-dependent for the color.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems to contradict what I assumed earlier about the "highest color"<br>rule being a tiebreaker, e.g., the word "preference" is used here.&nbsp; Is it<br>actually intended to be a deliberately configured priority/preference<br>scheme?&nbsp; If so, that would seem to require some wide-ranging reworking<br>throughout the document.<br><br>Section 9.3<br><br>&nbsp;  the most appropriate alternative for the active candidate path.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  fast re-route mechanism MAY then be used to trigger sub 50msec<br>&nbsp;  switchover from the active to the backup candidate path in the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding plane.&nbsp; Mechanisms like Bidirectional Forwarding Detection<br>&nbsp;  (BFD) MAY be used for fast detection of such failures.<br><br>Why is the specific 50msec value important here?&nbsp;

I suggest<br>using the introduction to introduce what is meant by the word, even if just<br>by reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation MAY allow the assignment of a symbolic name<br>&nbsp;

 [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution/">I-D.ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution</a>] or PCEP [<a href="/doc/rfc8231/">RFC8231</a>] and<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid/">I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid</a>].<br><br>The functionality of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid/">draft-ietf-pce-binding-label-sid</a> seems much more<br>limited than that of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution/">draft-ietf-idr-te-lsp-distribution</a>; in particular, the<br>former does not seem to actually report SR Policy state to the headed at<br>all; rather, it only concerns itself with BSID association to path, with no<br>information about "active", "not preferred", etc.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy P is invalid, the BSID B is not in the forwarding<br>&nbsp;  plane and hence the packet K is dropped by H.<br><br>We literally just in the previous section talked about a scenario where the<br>BSDI is kept in the forwarding plane (but with the action to drop, so the<br>overall outcome is not changed from what this text describes).&nbsp; Nonetheless,<br>it's inaccurate to state that "the BSID B is not in the forwarding plane"<br>here.<br><br>Section 8.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When a BGP route has multiple Color Extended communities each with a<br>&nbsp;  valid SR Policy, the BGP process installs the route on the SR Policy<br>&nbsp;  giving preference to the color with the highest numerical value.<br><br>Do we want to say anything about this being an arbitrary tiebreaker (rather<br>than an intentional preference), or is that thought to be implicitly clear?<br><br>Section 8.5<br><br>&nbsp;  In this section, independent of the a-priori existence of any<br>&nbsp;  explicit candidate path of the SR policy (C, N), it is to be noted<br>&nbsp;  that the BGP process at headend node H triggers the instantiation of<br>&nbsp;  a dynamic candidate path for the SR policy (C, N) as soon as:<br><br>I strongly suggest providing a more explicit framework of what the<br>assumptions and preconditions are for the mechanism described in this<br>section.&nbsp; My intuition says that it's a fairly optional thing that would<br>need to be specifically configured, but trying to wrap that sentiment into<br>the long bullet point involving "a local policy" seems like a very confusing<br>way to express the desired behavior.<br><br>Section 8.6<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; is configured to instantiate an array of paths to N where the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entry 0 is the IGP path to N, color C1 is the first entry and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Color C2 is the second entry.&nbsp; The index into the array is called<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Forwarding Class (FC).&nbsp; The index can have values 0 to 7.<br><br>Why are the only allowed values 0 to 7?&nbsp; Where does this restriction arise<br>from?&nbsp; It is because of some protocol element?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the local configuration does not specify any explicit forwarding<br>&nbsp;  information for an entry of the array, then this entry is filled with<br>&nbsp;  the same information as entry 0 (i.e. the IGP shortest path).<br><br>&nbsp;  If the SR Policy mapped to an entry of the array becomes invalid,<br>&nbsp;  then this entry is filled with the same information as entry 0.&nbsp; When<br>&nbsp;  all the array entries have the same information as entry0, the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding entry for N is updated to bypass the array and point<br>&nbsp;  directly to its outgoing interface and next-hop.<br><br>I can't tell how much of this is supposed to be protocol specification and<br>how much an illustrative example.&nbsp; Is A(0) always the IGP shortest path?<br>Are these protocol requirements to fall back to the IGP shortest path when<br>an entry is otherwise unpopulated or the associated SR Policy becomes<br>invalid?<br><br>Section 8.8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The steering preference is first based on the highest color value and<br>&nbsp;  then CO-dependent for the color.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems to contradict what I assumed earlier about the "highest color"<br>rule being a tiebreaker, e.g., the word "preference" is used here.&nbsp; Is it<br>actually intended to be a deliberately configured priority/preference<br>scheme?&nbsp; If so, that would seem to require some wide-ranging reworking<br>throughout the document.<br><br>Section 9.3<br><br>&nbsp;  the most appropriate alternative for the active candidate path.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  fast re-route mechanism MAY then be used to trigger sub 50msec<br>&nbsp;  switchover from the active to the backup candidate path in the<br>&nbsp;  forwarding plane.&nbsp; Mechanisms like Bidirectional Forwarding Detection<br>&nbsp;  (BFD) MAY be used for fast detection of such failures.<br><br>Why is the specific 50msec value important here?&nbsp; Is there some other<br>requirement that imposes it?<br><br>Section 10<br><br>I think we also want to mention the security considerations of several more<br>documents, including (but not limited to)<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> and RFCs 8660, 8754, and 8986.<br><br>Section 15.2<br><br>I agree with John that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> must be<br>classified as a normative reference.<br><br>It also seems that <a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC 7752</a> should be classified as normative, as we<br>incorporate its definition for the semantics of several of the segment type<br>descriptions.<br><br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy) [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>] is an ordered list of<br>&nbsp;  segments (i.e. instructions) that represent a source-routed policy.<br><br>/Segment/A Segment/<br><br>&nbsp;  The headend node is said to steer a flow into a SR Policy.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  packets steered into an SR Policy carry an ordered list of segments<br>&nbsp;  associated with that SR Policy.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>In a certain sense this can be read as saying that the packets that "carry<br>an ordered list of segments" are the ones prior to being steered into an SR<br>policy, which would make this statement not true.&nbsp; Perhaps we want to say<br>"after being steered into an SR Policy, packets carry an ordered list ..."?<br>(I also went back and forth with myself about whether "packets ... carry"<br>implies in the payload or not.&nbsp; I settled on "not" but make this note just<br>in case I am missing an aspect of that question.)<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  An SR Policy is a framework that enables the instantiation of an<br>&nbsp;  ordered list of segments on a node for implementing a source routing<br><br>It's easy to read this as saying that all of the segments in the list<br>instantiated on the single node in question, which I assume is not the<br>intent.&nbsp; Probably the easiest way to aid readability here is to split the<br>sentence up into multiple smaller sentences that are easier to parse.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A dynamic candidate path expresses an optimization objective and a<br>&nbsp;  set of constraints.&nbsp; The headend (potentially with the help of a PCE)<br>&nbsp;  computes the solution Segment-List (or set of Segment-Lists) that<br>&nbsp;  solves the optimization problem.<br><br>I'd suggest computes the solution/computes a solution/ for genericity.<br>A stateful PCE might end up computing a path that is not the optimal one for<br>this specific optimization problem, due to a desire to cooperate with other<br>paths in the network, and the "Min-Metric with margin and maximum number of<br>SIDs" objective in <a href="/doc/draft-filsfils-spring-sr-policy-considerations/">draft-filsfils-spring-sr-policy-considerations</a> doesn't<br>even have a guaranteed unique best solution.<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  When provisioning is via configuration, this is an implementation's<br>&nbsp;  configuration model-specific unique identifier for a candidate path.<br>&nbsp;  The default value is 0.<br><br>I'm having a lot of trouble parsing this.&nbsp; Did we perhaps mean to hyphenate<br>as "configuration-model-specific"?<br><br>Section 2.13<br><br>&nbsp;  The SR Policy POL1 is identified by the tuple .&nbsp; It has two candidate paths CP1 and CP2.&nbsp; Each is<br>&nbsp;  identified by a tuple .<br><br>I suggest (for the last sentence) "identified within the scope of POL1"<br><br>&nbsp;  forwarding instantiation of SR policy POL1.&nbsp; Traffic steered on POL1<br>&nbsp;  is flow-based hashed on Segment-List&nbsp; with a ratio<br>&nbsp;  W1/(W1+W2).<br><br>If I read "ratio" I would instinctively think of the ratio of (traffic on<br>segment list 1)/(traffic on segment list 2), as opposed to the proportion of<br>all traffic, that would be measured as the indicated W1/(W1+W2).<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The attached domain topology may be learned via IGP, BGP-LS or<br>&nbsp;  NETCONF.<br><br>&nbsp;  A non-attached (remote) domain topology may be learned via BGP-LS or<br>&nbsp;  NETCONF.<br><br>I think these are both probably not exhaustive lists, so "e.g." or similar<br>may be appropriate.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  Type C: IPv4 Prefix with optional SR Algorithm:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The headend is required to resolve the specified IPv4 Prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Address to the SR-MPLS label corresponding to a Prefix SID<br>&nbsp;

<br>If that possibility exists, the PCE can use any value (including the real <br>number or a random one).&nbsp; What issues exist with uncoordinated (or rogue) PCEs <br>using potentially arbitrary ASNs?<br><br>Why is this action recommended and not required?<br><br><br>(8) This paragraph in §2.5 seems to be missing something"<br><br>&nbsp;

 I guess you may mean "below in §2.6 (Identification of a<br>Candidate Path)", but that section says that the "tuple<br> uniquely identifies a candidate<br>path" and not just the discriminator as above.<br><br>Also, the ":" leads to some text about the default and specific protocols.<br>Given that this document intends to provide an architecture, I would expect<br>general consideration about the discriminator, and not pointers to how it can <br>be signaled or, much less, the process in BGP.&nbsp; In general, I would expect the<br>architecture to not rely on solution documents to explain how pieces of the<br>architecture are derived.<br><br><br>(9) Given the description, it seems possible for a PCE (for example) to<br>advertise multiple candidate paths with the same Preference, Originator, and<br>Discriminator.&nbsp;

When should one or the<br>other be used?&nbsp; There are no qualifiers that lead to the "otherwise" statement.<br><br><br>(13) §4: What is the purpose of enumerating the types of segment-descriptors?<br>Should the type be indicated when the Segment-List is signaled?&nbsp; I assume the<br>answer is yes, but I didn't see that specified anywhere.<br><br><br>(14) §5.1: "The headend detects a mismatch between the SID value and its <br>context provided for SIDs of type C-through-K"&nbsp; What does having a mismatch <br>mean?&nbsp; Please be specific.<br><br><br>(15) §5.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  When the local computation is not possible (e.g., a policy's tail-end<br>&nbsp;  is outside the topology known to the headend) or not desired, the<br>&nbsp;  headend MAY send path computation request to a PCE supporting PCEP<br>&nbsp;  extension specified in [<a href="/doc/rfc8664/">RFC8664</a>].<br><br>This action (ask the PCE) is a solution, not an architectural description.&nbsp; Are<br>there other external mechanisms that can find a "solution Segment-List"?&nbsp; It<br>seems to me that one such mechanism would be in the form of a configured<br>Segment-List.&nbsp; If that is correct, please generalize the normative statement<br>above -- where using PCEP can be an example.<br><br><br>(16) §7: Which are valid states?&nbsp; Active is one, the text mentions an<br>"administrative state", what else?&nbsp;  Interoperability is a good reason to<br>specify the states and not assume that implementations might do the right thing.<br><br><br>(17) §7: "The SR Policy state MUST also reflect the reason when a policy and/or<br>its candidate path is not active due to validation errors or not being<br>preferred."<br><br>Given that this is a requirement, please provide a list of reasons.&nbsp; The need<br>for interoperability (by using <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">rfc2119</a> language) can only be achieved if the<br>reasons are standardized.<br><br><br>(18) In general, the text contains a mixture of normative language (<a href="/doc/rfc2119/">rfc2119</a>) <br>and descriptions that make the contents inconsistent and confusing.&nbsp; For <br>example, my interpretation of "an SR Policy and its BSID are removed from the <br>forwarding plane" (from §8.1) is that it is an absolute requirement.&nbsp; However, <br>§8.2 presents the optional "Drop-Upon-Invalid behavior" which then indicates <br>that there can be cases where my interpretation was not correct.<br><br>The point here is that the text in a Standards Track document should not be up <br>for interpretation.<br><br>There are too many cases in the text to list that would have benefitted from<br>using Normative Language -- I mentioned a couple above.&nbsp; Ideally, the authors<br>would make one more pass for clarity.&nbsp; However, I will probably end up<br>ABSTAINing because of it.<br><br>This point was also raised in the rtg-dir review, which is why I'm not <br>including it as part of a DISCUSS.</div></td>

The shepherd writeup indicates that “Standard Track is requested and indicated in the title page header. This is appropriate for a specification of packet steering into an SR policy needing interoperability between the ingress/source of the policy instantiation and the egress/destination of the policy termination.”   <br><br>I realize it’s unusual to ask to discuss a shepherd writeup rather than the spec itself, but I think this one rises to the level. My concern is that this description (needing interoperability between the ingress and the egress) doesn’t comport with my understanding of the Segment Routing architecture. Surely, one of the key value propositions of SR is that it’s stateless everywhere other than the headend? Indeed, that’s stated in the abstract. SR doesn’t require the egress to even understand that it IS an egress of a SR Policy, it just does what the headers tell it to, right?<br><br>If that's so, then the rationale given for the requested track must be wrong. :-( And that in turn leads me to ask, whether the track really is right. It seems to me that in most respects this is more an Informational document than a standards track one. That’s not a value judgement in any respect, just a statement of fact — for the most part, it doesn’t seem as though the information found in this document is needed in order to interoperate with another system. (Section 8.8 is an exception, I discuss that separately.)  <br><br>Anyway, not to get too far ahead of myself, let’s start by working on this question: is the shepherd writeup correct in saying that interoperability between headend and tailend is required? If so, can someone please characterize the nature of that interoperability, and put it in the context of SR’s stateless nature?<br><br>2. It seems to me an unusual practice for this document to be defining semantics and even reserving values in a field allocated by a different document, by a different WG. I’m referring here to the so-called “‘Color-Only’ bits” discussed in Section 8.8.   <br><br>- I would be more comfortable if the work were all done in one place, to the extent possible.<br><br> - Given the fact this document is reaching in to a registry normally managed by IDR, was there any discussion with the IDR group? I don’t see any evidence of a courtesy notification of the last call when I look at the IDR mailing list archive.   <br><br>I’ve also emailed the IDR list about this in connection with <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a>, see <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/idr/yCcZdStmTR-FLUYGHTsLLBv5aWo/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/idr/yCcZdStmTR-FLUYGHTsLLBv5aWo/</a>  <br><br>Relating this back to my previous question, it’s evident that if this document is going to define semantics for the Color Extended Community Flags, then that makes it Standards Track because there is an interoperability factor to take into account (that's been imported from IDR). A more ideal solution would be to take care of that in the IDR document rather than putting it in this “architecture” document, though. Surely, this kind of detail is implementation, not architecture?  Indeed, Ketan said in his reply to Matthew Bocci's RTG review, "Given that this is an architecture document, it describes the architecture and not really the protocol mechanisms"... but this section seems to be an exception to that aspiration.<br><br>3. Related to the above, at least one of the references listed as informational clearly has to be normative with the document as it stands. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> is the one I’m thinking of, for example its use in §2.4 seems like it may rise to the "normative" level, §2.5 almost surely does, §4.1 surely does, and §8.8.1 is the icing on the cake because this document defines semantics for a field that isn’t even allocated until and unless <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy/">draft-ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy</a> is published. <br><br>4. In §2.1 you talk about the signaling of symbolic names for candidate paths. Although you are careful to say that such symbolic names are only used for presentation purposes, it seems to me they still could be considered a new potential source of vulnerability, since a string that has no sanity-checking whatsoever applied by the protocol can display literally anything to an operator viewing it. Shouldn’t this be addressed in your Security Considerations? (For an example of a related Security Considerations, see <a href="/doc/rfc9003/">RFC 9003</a>.

Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The document contains a "Guidance for Designated Experts" section.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The document has no sections written in formal language.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Those have been addressed by the editor.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The document has no MIB, Yang model, media type or URI type.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No. All normative references are active RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations are consistent with the body of the document. No additional comments or concerns.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The document contains a "Guidance for Designated Experts" section.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The document has no sections written in formal language.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The document does not define a YANG module but makes reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-sr-policy-yang/">I-D.ietf-spring-sr-policy-yang</a> section-11 as part of the manageability considerations.<br><br></div></td>
