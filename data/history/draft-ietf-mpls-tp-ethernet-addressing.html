However, there is also a SHOULD for the new mechanism in this document. So which method should I use as a default?<br><br>Discussing with Stewart, the authors should make it clear that&nbsp; <br>1. If ARP/LLDP is/are available, they are the preferred methods<br>2. If ARP/LLDP is/are not available, rather than using the hand configured unicast or the broadcast address mechanisms, use the 01-00-5E-90-00-00 mechanism<br><br>2.<br>Manageability Considerations<br><br>Because this mechanism proposed in this document relies on point-to-point interfaces only, you're missing that the interface type, whether point-to-point or multi-point, must be clearly labeled, and this information must be available to the network operator. Any changes of interface type must be notified to the network operator.<br>See my next email to the OPS-DIR on this topic.</div></td>

FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF<br>Reordering might help with understanding the process.<br><br>If multicast/broadcast LSPs, there doesn't seem to be any actual<br>recommendations or advice in the document.&nbsp; There is only an<br>admonition to use encapsulation, which is probably necessary for other<br>reasons anyhow.&nbsp; So it's not clear how Section 3, paragraph 1 is<br>relevant to this document.&nbsp; It doesn't offer any guidance on how one<br>might select an appropriate Ethernet address for those frames.<br>Presumably these could be unicast, multicast or broadcast depending on<br>routing requirements for the LSP, in which case maybe there is no good<br>advice to give. If there really is no good advice to give, or there is<br>no intent to provide advice for multicast/broadcast LSPs, a statement<br>to that effect would be helpful.<br><br>Section 3, Paragraph 2 just reiterates parts of Section 2, it could be removed.<br><br>S5: I can't reconcile "The advertised information SHOULD be persistent<br>across restarts."&nbsp; with "Received advertisements MUST be discarded<br>across restarts."<br><br>S4, pp5: Why force a mapping to EUI-64?&nbsp; Is canonicalization important<br>for some reason?<br><br>S4, pp5: The paragraph beginning with "In the event a GAP message is<br>not received within the previously received associated Lifetime, ..."<br>is a little confusing (and I'm familiar with G-ACh already).&nbsp; This<br>could be clearer.&nbsp; Maybe:&nbsp; "A node could cease transmission of G-ACh<br>advertisements, or cease to include a Source MAC Address TLV in<br>advertisements, either of which cause the TLV lifetime to elapse.<br>After the Source MAC Address TLV lifetime has elapsed, this value<br>SHOULD no longer be used to select a MAC address; the node SHOULD<br>return to selecting MAC addresses as though no advertisements were<br>received."<br><br>S7.3: IETF review is a pretty high bar.&nbsp; (Sadly, I missed this on<br>G-ACh, or I would have made the same comment.)&nbsp; Did you consider<br>allowing IESG Approval as an alternative?<br><br><br>Nits/editorial comments:<br>There are a couple of lowercase instances of <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> keywords that<br>could be confusing.&nbsp; The very last line of S4, the second last<br>sentence of S2.&nbsp; Consider alternative wordings for these statements.<br><br>S2, pp3: s/i.e.&nbsp; /i.e., /</div></td>

The aim of my review is to catch any<br>issues that might show up in IETF last call, directorate reviews, or<br>IESG evaluation. The intent is to resolve the issues by text changes<br>or through email discussion to smooth the passage of the document<br>through the later stages of the process.<br><br>I have reviewed this document jointly with <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a><br>and since the author team is the same for the two documents, I<br>recommend that you process the comments for the two documents at the<br>same time.<br><br>As usual, all my comments are open for disagreement and discussion. I<br>think that you will probably want to produce a revision of this <br>document to address my comments, so I have put it into "Revised I-D<br>Needed" state in the data tracker.<br><br>Thanks for the work,<br>Adrian<br><br>===<br><br>The abbreviations GAL and OAM are not used in the document and can be <br>removed from Section 1.1.<br><br>---<br><br>Am I missing something? Why do you only support 48-bit MAC addresses?<br><br>---<br><br>I am *really* surprised that this document does not mention LLDP. In<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>] you state...<br><br>&nbsp;  Where<br>&nbsp;  it is anticipated that the sole purpose of the GAP will be to provide<br>&nbsp;  Ethernet MAC address learning, the use of LLDP SHOULD be considered.<br><br>So this document needs to say the same thing (all over and in 18pt red<br>bold). Furthermore, it needs to define what "HOULD" means in this<br>context. <br><br>---<br><br>In Section 4...<br><br>Could you please identify (with TBD1 - to be assigned by IANA) the<br>application ID of the new "Ethernet Interface Parameters" application.<br><br>Could you please state: "The format of the TLVs is as defined in <br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>].<br><br>Could you please include the type values for the two TLVs you are<br>defining (so that people don't have to look ahead to the IANA section).<br><br>Since the two TLVs you are defining have predictable lengths, it would<br>be nice if you included the specific length values to be used.<br><br>---<br><br>I think section 4 is missing something. It is clear from<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>] that at least one TLV must be present in the <br>Ethernet Interface Parameters" ADB element. Is there a requirement that<br>the Source MAC Address TLV is always present? What are the rules for<br>multiple occurrences of either of the TLVs you have defined?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>---<br><br>Somewhere, probably Section 4, should leverage the stated intention in<br>[ID.ietf-mpls-gach-adv] by stating that the values received in the new<br>ADB element SHOULD (or probably MUST) be made accessible for inspection<br>by network operators, and where local configuration is updated by the<br>received information, it MUST be clear why the configured value has<br>been changed. Furthermore, you probably need to discuss whether<br>information learned in this way is allowed to be persistent across<br>node or interface discontinuities. (The last point suggests to me that<br>you might want to include a brief section on handling changes in<br>adjacent MAC addresses - a point that you have given as a motivation<br>for the work.)<br><br>---<br><br>In my comments on [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>] I ask about the consequences<br>of message loss. This issue seems to apply to this document so, <br>depending on how you handle the issue in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>] you<br>may need to add something to this document.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 5 should reference [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-gach-adv/">I-D.ietf-mpls-gach-adv</a>] for the security<br>properties of the GAP. It should probably note that an effective <br>attack is modifying the Source MAC Address value, while modifying the<br>MTU value may also have significant consequences. Furthermore, it may<br>be the case that visibility into the contents of either of the TLVs<br>could provide information that is useful for an attacker.<br><br>---<br><br>In section 6.1, please include an IANA action to update the reference<br>for the MAC address to point to the RFC number assigned to this <br>document on publication.<br><br>---<br><br>In section 6.2, could you please replace 0x0001 with TBD1.<br><br>---<br><br>Trivial point, but there are precisely three authors, all marked as <br>editors.
