I get that<br>this'd be a lot of editing work to fix though, but I<br>think it would make the eventual RFC more useful for<br>longer if someone has the time and energy.<br><br>- 5.3 uses the term "nonce" wrong I think, I guess you<br>mean cookie really.<br><br>- 6.2, a reference for the "some national authorities"<br>statement would be nice to have.<br><br>- 6.3, "architecting new certificate authorities" isn't<br>quite right, you're talking about building new PKIs which<br>is a deployment and not necessarily a s/w thing. Bit of a<br>nit though.<br><br>- 6.X, I could suggest adding a new 6.7 since another<br>important thing that has changed is snowdonia. I can buy<br>that that's not done here though since STIR has been<br>underway whilst we're still figuring out snowdonia.&nbsp; It<br>could still be worth noting though, since there is a real<br>tension there the WG will have to deal with.&nbsp; That<br>tension being the inherent one between securing origin<br>information (good) and assisting pervasive monitoring<br>(bad). I realise that not all those involved in STIR do<br>consider PM as a bad thing, as least insofar as it might<br>be assisted by STIR, but nonetheless the tension is real.<br><br>- 7: I think you should say that these requirements will<br>be elucidated further in the WG. The reason is that<br>they're quite informally stated (e.g. "golden root")<br>which is ok as long as they're not used later as gospel<br>since that would likely lead to repeating arguments and<br>delay. If you do mean these requirements as gospel, <br>then I think I'd likely turn this into a discuss.<br><br>- 7: The privacy requirement is limited to the<br>out-of-band case. I'm sure there will be things to say<br>about the in-band case too that will be different for<br>different potential solutions. I'm not sure if there's a<br>useful requirement you can state here though for that<br>without getting into solution detail. Was that<br>considered?</div></td>
