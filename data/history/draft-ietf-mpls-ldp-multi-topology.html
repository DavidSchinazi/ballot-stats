If that<br>is the case, why not simply use exactly the same value?<br><br>And looking at the registry further, it seems to say that only values<br>allocated by IANA and stored in the registry can be used. That means<br>that an operator that wants to use MT in their network cannot just<br>assign values to the MT-IDs for the topologies because the registry<br>has no space for this to happen.<br><br>Now, it is possible that you have simply used the wrong words in the<br>registry in section 9, and failed to provide any explanation in the<br>text.&nbsp; Note that "unassigned" means "not yet assigned, but available<br>to be assigned by IANA".&nbsp; And "Reserved" means "Do not assign until<br>a new RFC defines how they should be used."<br><br>But there are other questions:<br><br>Why do you need 16 bits when ISIS has only 12 bits and OSPF only 8 bits?<br>I guess 16 is convenient to hold either, but how are the top 4 bits to<br>be handled?<br><br>How do you handle the case where there are multiple instances of an IGP<br>(or different IGPs) running?<br><br>If you *do* expect there to be a mapping function between IGP MT-ID and<br>LDP MT-ID, how do you ensure the same function is used at both ends of<br>an LDP session?<br><br>But Section 3.8 really does seem to say that only MT-IDs in the registry<br>are allowed, which seems to make this I-D almost useless because you<br>have only defined "default" (which we have already), "ISIS IPv6", and<br>"all".
