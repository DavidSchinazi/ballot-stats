The<br>problem I have is exactly explained in e third paragraph of the <br>document, but that is too late. <br><br>The issue is that the term "attack" is being used in a specific context<br>(that of security) in a document that has a wider readership and <br>applicablity. The largest concern I have is evidenced by a number of <br>comments received in reviews, and it is that this specialist usage of a<br>word is not perceived by some readers who then get "upset" by the <br>statement that this is a normal-English-language-meaning attack.<br><br>The telling point for me is that the Abstract actually sensed this issue<br>and used "technical attack" which is kind of helpful although it is a<br>third term that is not used elsewhere in the document.<br><br>I took the precaution of talking to a copy editor about how one normally<br>handles this sort of issue, and the answer leads to some simple changes <br>to the text. The general solution is to use "Security Attack" instead of<br>"attack" thereby using a term that fits the paragraph 3 definition and<br>clearly indicates that a specialist maning is being applied. So:<br><br>- Document title s/Attack/Security Attack/<br>- Running header s/Attack/Security Attack/<br>- Abstract s/technical attack/Security Attack/<br>- Section 1 para 2 s/attack/Security Attack/ twice<br>- and so on throughout the document<br><br>I fully expect to hear back that this is a fiddling little change that <br>is not worth the effort. I think it is worth the effort and makes a big<br>difference and will happily make the edits.<br><br>Again, this is not something that can be Discussable, but given that the<br>readership of this document will be wide, it behoves us to get this tone<br>correct. <br><br>---<br><br>Section 1 para 2<br><br>&nbsp;  PM is distinguished<br>&nbsp;  by being indiscriminate and very large-scale, rather than by<br>&nbsp;  introducing new types of technical compromise.<br><br>Could clarification. suggest it belongs in para 1 not inbetween two&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>sentences about the IETF's views.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1 para 4<br><br>&nbsp;  The<br>&nbsp;  motivation for PM is not relevant for this document, but can range<br>&nbsp;  from non-targeted nation-state surveillance, to legal but privacy-<br>&nbsp;  unfriendly purposes by commercial enterprises, to illegal actions by<br>&nbsp;  criminals.<br><br>The motivation is not relevant in this document, but we are going to <br>talk about it anyway :-)<br><br>Great to say it is not relevant.

Since that, I have not kept up to date with the perpass related emails. A quick search in my system tells me "1942 emails with perpass in the subject", and <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?q=perpass">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?q=perpass</a> shows even more emails.<br>* I have not had the chance to synch up with Joel Jaeggli on this topic<br><br>On the Internet, there are actually conflicting interests:<br>The end user (and I'm one of them) wants access to every services, with good SLAs all the time, for free, and demand confidentiality on top of that.<br>The network operators (in a typical enterprise network), on the other hand, have to manage the users, the network, the services, and introduce innovation through some new services.<br><br>Point 1: How do we bring innovation to the Internet, and where?<br>How do we distinguish good attack versus bad attack (referring to the last paragraph of section 1, "In particular, the term attack, used technically, implies nothing about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack. ...")? How do we distinguish pervasive monitoring for a noble goal from the rest (for example: Internet surveillance)<br>This is the key difference between the security world and my OPS world, between the end user interest and the network operator job.<br>What's called an attack in the document could actually be the basis for a service in my OPS world:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - "measuring packet sizes"for a billing service<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - "Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (..., timing or measuring packet sizes)", required for SLA measurements, in order to understand if voice or video flows should be treated differently than the rest.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - "including application content ", required for data leakage (a real problem in today networks), malware detection, etc.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - "looking at traffic header" to route traffic between a primary costly link with SLA, and a cheap backup<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - load balancer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - traffic redirection (WCCP)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  - etc...<br>The point is that middleboxes needs to provide a service, and they need some input for that. So if this is not provided by traffic monitoring, the only solution is that the end points need to send their metadata to the middleboxes. This was not well received at the IETF lately, and this goes against the principles of this draft:<br><br>&nbsp;  Pervasive monitoring is a technical attack that should be mitigated<br>&nbsp;  in the design of IETF protocols, where possible.<br><br>Alternatively, we could say: all innovation will come from the end points. IMO, some innovation (read some new services) must happen inside the network, as opposed to the end points. Yes, if we had 1000 times the bandwidth we have today on all end points, and btw, no constrained devices, then yes, we could delegate all innovations to the end points. But that's not the case!<br><br>Don't get me wrong: I like what this draft tries to do, but it doesn't make any distinction between good and reasons for pervasive monitoring. This leads to my point 2.<br><br>Point 2: who decides what's right or wrong?<br>The following text goes in the right direction for OPS. Thanks.<br><br>&nbsp;  While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring can be beneficial<br>&nbsp;  and not part of any attack, e.g. network management functions monitor<br>&nbsp;  packets or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message<br>&nbsp;  content.&nbsp; Some monitoring can even be part of the mitigation for PM,<br>&nbsp;  for example Certificate Transparency [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring<br>&nbsp;  Public Key Infrastructure in ways that could detect some PM attack<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; There is though a clear potential for monitoring<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms to be abused for PM, so this tension needs careful<br>&nbsp;  consideration in protocol design.&nbsp; Making networks unmanageable to<br>&nbsp;  mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go<br>&nbsp;  against the consensus documented here.&nbsp; An appropriate balance will<br>&nbsp;  emerge over time as real instances of this tension are considered.<br><br>However, who will be the judge to tell whether work at the IETF is a good PM (for monitoring) or a bad PM?<br>I wonder: if the IPFIX work would starting today at the IETF, would this be considered as a PM and blocked? Who would decide? Consensus based, IESG, IAB?<br><br>Point 3: pervasive monitoring versus monitoring<br>We could say that points 1 and 2 don't matter because the PM definition doesn't apply ("PM is distinguished by being indiscriminate and very large-scale") to the services I described in point 1.<br>It depends. Data leakage analysis is done all traffic existing an enterprise network, SLA are typical metered in all branch offices or all Point of Presence (PoP), etc.&nbsp;  I guess that&nbsp; "very large-scale" means outside of the network operator administrative admin?&nbsp;  <br><br>Point 4: unmanageable networks<br>I like this sentence "Making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome".<br>Note: half-joking, I mentioned to Stephen after the version 00 of the document, I would be looking for a "close the OPS area" button in the tracker if this "let's have end-to-end privacy at all costs" principle would be accepted without any balance, as they would nothing left to manage in OPS. Maybe that's a good thing. :-)<br><br>Not sure where to go from here. I'm not sure.<br>- I would like to get a discussion with the IESG<br>- I could also review all perpass emails. If some specific points were discussed already, a pointer to the discussion would be appreciated.<br>- I could synch up more with the OPS DIR<br>- I could have a call with the authors<br>Don't get me wrong, I'm against the document, but we need some more nuance.<br><br>Below is some good feedback fromDan Romascanu (OPS DIR review):<br>The principal impact that this document has on operations and management of the IETF protocol is included in the following paragraph in Section 2:<br><br>&nbsp;  While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring can be beneficial<br>&nbsp;  and not part of any attack, e.g. network management functions monitor<br>&nbsp;  packets or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message<br>&nbsp;  content.&nbsp; Some monitoring can even be part of the mitigation for PM,<br>&nbsp;  for example Certificate Transparency [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring<br>&nbsp;  Public Key Infrastructure in ways that could detect some PM attack<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; There is though a clear potential for monitoring<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms to be abused for PM, so this tension needs careful<br>&nbsp;  consideration in protocol design.&nbsp; Making networks unmanageable to<br>&nbsp;  mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go<br>&nbsp;  against the consensus documented here.&nbsp; An appropriate balance will<br>&nbsp;  emerge over time as real instances of this tension are considered.<br><br>The text above was carefully crafted and debated during the various reviews I believe that it is OK as it is, but the OPS community should debate whether work is necessary in the area (maybe in the OPSEC WG) in order to look at the following aspects:<br><br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; Issue recommendations that could help protect the tools (applications, protocols, data repositories) used by operators for the day to day tasks or running and managing the networks from being used for pervasive monitoring (in the words of the document – how can we make sure in practical terms that useful monitoring mechanisms are not abused for PM?)<br><br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; Review the existing protocols designed in the OPS area which have broad deployment and make sure that they have been designed in such a manner that the threat of a pervasive monitoring attack can be mitigated. If necessary (gaps were found out) issue recommendations for ‘ruggedizing’ these protocols against PM attacks<br><br>A few more observations:<br><br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; In Section 2 the following sentence is IMO not clear enough: ‘It means that, if asked, there needs to be a good answer to the question "is pervasive monitoring relevant to this work and if so how has it been considered?"’ Who asks? Is this about the IESG reviews, or maybe about some kind of privacy assessment (done by whom?)<br><br>-&nbsp; &nbsp; I found too little relation between this document and <a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>. That Informational RFC provides actually a set of good recommendations on mitigation for privacy issues, many of them directly applicable against PM threats. It is also a very recent document, published only six months ago. It seems odd that the information[<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>] is mentioned only once and in an unclear way – the reference is just written in brackets between two sentences, not clear if it belongs to the sentence before or the sentence after.</div></td>

There is evidence that deployed PM systems<br>SB&gt; end ran the assumed security models of the Internet, and in <br>SB&gt; some cases subverted them. It is the conclusion of the IETF that<br>SB&gt; IETF protocols should in future be designed to provide greater<br>SB&gt; (maybe: ", but not necessarily perfect") privacy in the presence of PM.<br><br><br> 1.&nbsp; Pervasive Monitoring is a Widespread Attack on Privacy<br><br>SB&gt; Yes and no. It is not clear whether the passive collection of the <br>SB&gt; data is such an attack. For example if the collected data<br>SB&gt; were held in some unreadable form (for example encrypted)<br>SB&gt; would this be an attack? It surely becomes an invasion of<br>SB&gt; privacy at the point where it is subjected to unwarranted<br>SB&gt; (in both senses of the word) analysis of its content.<br>SB&gt; The subversion of security with its wider implications for<br>SB&gt; the introduction of exploits by others is in a different<br>SB&gt; (worse) class than basic collection of bytes passing by.<br><br>&nbsp;  Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)<br>&nbsp;  surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,<br>&nbsp;  including application content, or protocol meta-data such as headers.<br><br>SB&gt; Some forms of PM are seemingly intrusive in that they actively<br>SB&gt; damage the security model leaving it more vulnerable, others <br>SB&gt; it seems are passive.<br><br>&nbsp;  Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,<br>&nbsp;  timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic<br>&nbsp;  keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive<br>&nbsp;  monitoring.<br><br>SB&gt; You do not distinguish between these two classes of action<br>SB&gt; but I think they are importantly different.<br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF community's technical assessment is that PM is an attack on<br>&nbsp;  the privacy of Internet users and organizations.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; I am not sure you can say that without a lot more information on the <br>SB&gt; technical details of what was done. <br><br>&nbsp;  PM is distinguished<br>&nbsp;  by being indiscriminate and very large-scale, rather than by<br>&nbsp;  introducing new types of technical compromise.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; I think that this contradicts the earlier text and is technically<br>SB&gt; incorrect. I think that there were some technical approaches used.<br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF community<br>&nbsp;  has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be<br>&nbsp;  mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM<br>&nbsp;  significantly more expensive or infeasible.&nbsp; Pervasive Monitoring was<br>&nbsp;  discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting<br>&nbsp;  [IETF88Plenary] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing<br>&nbsp;  lists.&nbsp; This document records the IETF community's consensus and<br>&nbsp;  establishes the technical nature of PM.<br><br><br>SB&gt; There were three hums were there not. Not all were fully endorsed<br>SB&gt; as others. Surely to be a fair record we need to qualify the above.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The term "attack" is used here in a technical sense that differs<br>&nbsp;  somewhat from common English usage.&nbsp; In common English usage, an<br>&nbsp;  attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended<br>&nbsp;  to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.&nbsp; The term is<br>&nbsp;  used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of<br>&nbsp;  communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; It seems to me that rather than take advantage of the emotivity<br>SB&gt; of the technical word, we should use a more objective term and then<br>SB&gt; qualify then note the equivalence for the security technical<br>SB&gt; community.<br><br>&nbsp;  An<br>&nbsp;  attack may change the content of the communication, record the<br>&nbsp;  content or external characteristics of the communication, or through<br>&nbsp;  correlation with other communication events, reveal information the<br>&nbsp;  parties did not intend to be revealed.&nbsp; It may also have other<br>&nbsp;  effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.<br><br>SB&gt; I think that you are taking advantage of the technical definition<br>SB&gt; to introduce emotion rather than strict objectivity and impartiality.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC4949</a>] contains a more complete definition for the term attack.<br>&nbsp;  We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality<br>&nbsp;  may require a multi-faceted set of coordinated attacks.<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, the term attack, used technically, implies nothing<br>&nbsp;  about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  motivation for PM is not relevant for this document, but can range<br>&nbsp;  from non-targeted nation-state surveillance, to legal but privacy-<br>&nbsp;  unfriendly purposes by commercial enterprises, to illegal actions by<br>&nbsp;  criminals.&nbsp; The same techniques can be used regardless of motivation.<br>&nbsp;  Thus we cannot defend against the most nefarious actors while<br>&nbsp;  allowing monitoring by other actors no matter how benevolent some<br>&nbsp;  might consider them to be, since the actions required are<br>&nbsp;  indistinguishable from other attacks.<br><br><br>SB&gt; That is the crux of the dilemma and deserves to be more prominent.<br>SB&gt; I think the text "no matter how benevolent some might consider them"<br>SB&gt; is unnecessarily judgmental. We may all have different thresholds<br>SB&gt; for warranted analysis, but there are cases where most ordinary<br>SB&gt; people would consider the gathering of the information was <br>SB&gt; morally justified.<br><br><br><br>2.&nbsp; The IETF will work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring<br><br>&nbsp;  "Mitigation" is a technical term that does not imply an ability to<br>&nbsp;  completely prevent or thwart an attack.&nbsp; Protocols that mitigate PM<br>&nbsp;  will not prevent the attack, but can significantly change the threat.<br>&nbsp;  (See the diagram on page 24 of <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a> for how the terms attack and<br>&nbsp;  threat are related.)&nbsp; This can significantly increase the cost of<br>&nbsp;  attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack more<br>&nbsp;  likely to be detected, possibly later.<br><br>SB&gt; I am not sure forcing all monitoring to be overt is a good thing.<br>SB&gt; Overt implies detectability from outside the monitoring system<br>SB&gt; and its associated control environment. There are cases in law <br>SB&gt; enforcement where few would consider the complete removal of <br>SB&gt; undetectability desirable or morally defensible.<br><br>&nbsp;  IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet<br>&nbsp;  communications and there are guidelines [<a href="/doc/rfc3552/">RFC3552</a>] for applying these<br>&nbsp;  in protocol design.&nbsp; But those generally do not consider PM, the<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality of protocol meta-data, countering traffic analysis<br>&nbsp;  nor data minimisation.&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>] In all cases, there will remain<br>&nbsp;  some privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by<br>&nbsp;  protocols.&nbsp; As technology advances, techniques that were once only<br>&nbsp;  available to extremely well funded actors become more widely<br>&nbsp;  accessible.&nbsp; Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide<br>&nbsp;  range of similar attacks.<br><br>SB&gt; Maybe it's later, but I thought that we agreed that there were<br>SB&gt; operational reasons to gather some of the protocol artifacts.<br><br>&nbsp;  It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties<br>&nbsp;  of our standards.&nbsp; The IETF will work to mitigate the technical<br>&nbsp;  aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.<br>&nbsp;  The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as<br>&nbsp;  mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described<br>&nbsp;  here.<br><br>&nbsp;  Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how<br>&nbsp;  they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work<br>&nbsp;  to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  does not mean a new "pervasive monitoring considerations" section is<br>&nbsp;  needed in IETF documentation.&nbsp; It means that, if asked, there needs<br>&nbsp;  to be a good answer to the question "is pervasive monitoring relevant<br>&nbsp;  to this work and if so how has it been considered?"<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing<br>&nbsp;  technology is re-used, may significantly impact the vulnerability of<br>&nbsp;  a protocol to PM.&nbsp; Those developing IETF specifications therefore<br>&nbsp;  need to consider mitigating PM when making these architectural<br>&nbsp;  decisions.&nbsp; Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions<br>&nbsp;  including whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is<br>&nbsp;  important.&nbsp; Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the<br>&nbsp;  process is very costly.<br><br>SB&gt; For balance the following needs to be earlier in the text.<br>SB&gt; As it is here it is something of an afterthought which belittles<br>SB&gt; its legitimacy and importance.<br><br>&nbsp;  While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring can be beneficial<br>&nbsp;  and not part of any attack, e.g. network management functions monitor<br>&nbsp;  packets or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message<br>&nbsp;  content.&nbsp; Some monitoring can even be part of the mitigation for PM,<br>&nbsp;  for example Certificate Transparency [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring<br>&nbsp;  Public Key Infrastructure in ways that could detect some PM attack<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; There is though a clear potential for monitoring<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms to be abused for PM, so this tension needs careful<br>&nbsp;  consideration in protocol design.&nbsp; Making networks unmanageable to<br>&nbsp;  mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go<br>&nbsp;  against the consensus documented here.&nbsp; An appropriate balance will<br>&nbsp;  emerge over time as real instances of this tension are considered.<br><br>&nbsp;  Finally, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not<br>&nbsp;  control the implementation or deployment of our specifications<br>&nbsp;  (though IETF participants do develop many implementations), nor does<br>&nbsp;  the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol stack.&nbsp; Moreover, the<br>&nbsp;  non-technical (e.g. legal and political) aspects of mitigating<br>&nbsp;  pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM, if<br>&nbsp;  it is to be fully addressed.<br><br>&nbsp;  To summarise: current capabilities permit some actors to monitor<br>&nbsp;  content and meta-data across the Internet at a scale never before<br>&nbsp;  seen.&nbsp; This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.<br>SB&gt; Do you mean Internet privacy, or the privacy of Internet transactions?<br>SB&gt; Other than to prevent attack, or compromise the commercial secrets<br>SB&gt; of operators, I am not sure the Internet has any right to privacy.<br>SB&gt; On the other hand internet users have the right to have their<br>SB&gt; Internet transactions guarded to the degree agreed by their society.<br> <br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate<br>&nbsp;  pervasive monitoring attacks.<br><br>SB&gt; I think we mean appropriately mitigate, since the degree of<br>SB&gt; acceptable mitigation is a societal matter.<br><br> 3.&nbsp; Process Note<br><br>&nbsp;  In the past, architectural statements of this sort, e.g., [<a href="/doc/rfc1984/">RFC1984</a>]<br>&nbsp;  and [<a href="/doc/rfc2804/">RFC2804</a>] have been published as joint products of the Internet<br>&nbsp;  Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board<br>&nbsp;  (IAB).&nbsp; However, since those documents were published, the IETF and<br>&nbsp;  IAB have separated their publication "streams" as described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4844/">RFC4844</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc5741/">RFC5741</a>].&nbsp; This document was initiated by both the<br>&nbsp;  IESG and IAB, but is published as an IETF-stream consensus document,<br>&nbsp;  in order to ensure that it properly reflects the consensus of the<br>&nbsp;  IETF community as a whole.<br><br>&nbsp;  [[Note (to be removed before publication): This draft is written as<br>&nbsp;  if IETF consensus has been established for the text.]]<br><br><br>4.&nbsp; Security Considerations<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is entirely about privacy.&nbsp; More information about the<br>&nbsp;  relationship between security and privacy threats can be found in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>].&nbsp; Section 5.1.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>] specifically addresses<br>&nbsp;  surveillance as a combined security-privacy threat.<br><br>SB&gt; I think that the security considerations are surely more complex than<br>SB&gt; this. Given that some degree of monitoring is inevitable should<br>SB&gt; we not develop some security guidelines of the form "and if<br>SB&gt; you really must do some form of information gathering, here is<br>SB&gt; how you should secure it from illegitimate access".</div></td>

I'm not a big believer in "silence as assent", especially when it comes to individual submissions.

There is evidence that deployed PM systems<br>SB&gt; end ran the assumed security models of the Internet, and in <br>SB&gt; some cases subverted them. It is the conclusion of the IETF that<br>SB&gt; IETF protocols should in future be designed to provide greater<br>SB&gt; (maybe: ", but not necessarily perfect") privacy in the presence of PM.<br><br><br> 1.&nbsp; Pervasive Monitoring is a Widespread Attack on Privacy<br><br>SB&gt; Yes and no. It is not clear whether the passive collection of the <br>SB&gt; data is such an attack. For example if the collected data<br>SB&gt; were held in some unreadable form (for example encrypted)<br>SB&gt; would this be an attack? It surely becomes an invasion of<br>SB&gt; privacy at the point where it is subjected to unwarranted<br>SB&gt; (in both senses of the word) analysis of its content.<br>SB&gt; The subversion of security with its wider implications for<br>SB&gt; the introduction of exploits by others is in a different<br>SB&gt; (worse) class than basic collection of bytes passing by.<br><br>&nbsp;  Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is widespread (and often covert)<br>&nbsp;  surveillance through intrusive gathering of protocol artefacts,<br>&nbsp;  including application content, or protocol meta-data such as headers.<br><br>SB&gt; Some forms of PM are seemingly intrusive in that they actively<br>SB&gt; damage the security model leaving it more vulnerable, others <br>SB&gt; it seems are passive.<br><br>&nbsp;  Active or passive wiretaps and traffic analysis, (e.g., correlation,<br>&nbsp;  timing or measuring packet sizes), or subverting the cryptographic<br>&nbsp;  keys used to secure protocols can also be used as part of pervasive<br>&nbsp;  monitoring.<br><br>SB&gt; You do not distinguish between these two classes of action<br>SB&gt; but I think they are importantly different.<br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF community's technical assessment is that PM is an attack on<br>&nbsp;  the privacy of Internet users and organizations.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; I am not sure you can say that without a lot more information on the <br>SB&gt; technical details of what was done. <br><br>&nbsp;  PM is distinguished<br>&nbsp;  by being indiscriminate and very large-scale, rather than by<br>&nbsp;  introducing new types of technical compromise.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; I think that this contradicts the earlier text and is technically<br>SB&gt; incorrect. I think that there were some technical approaches used.<br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF community<br>&nbsp;  has expressed strong agreement that PM is an attack that needs to be<br>&nbsp;  mitigated where possible, via the design of protocols that make PM<br>&nbsp;  significantly more expensive or infeasible.&nbsp; Pervasive Monitoring was<br>&nbsp;  discussed at the technical plenary of the November 2013 IETF meeting<br>&nbsp;  [IETF88Plenary] and then through extensive exchanges on IETF mailing<br>&nbsp;  lists.&nbsp; This document records the IETF community's consensus and<br>&nbsp;  establishes the technical nature of PM.<br><br><br>SB&gt; There were three hums were there not. Not all were fully endorsed<br>SB&gt; as others. Surely to be a fair record we need to qualify the above.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The term "attack" is used here in a technical sense that differs<br>&nbsp;  somewhat from common English usage.&nbsp; In common English usage, an<br>&nbsp;  attack is an aggressive action perpetrated by an opponent, intended<br>&nbsp;  to enforce the opponent's will on the attacked party.&nbsp; The term is<br>&nbsp;  used here to refer to behavior that subverts the intent of<br>&nbsp;  communicating parties without the agreement of those parties.&nbsp; <br><br>SB&gt; It seems to me that rather than take advantage of the emotivity<br>SB&gt; of the technical word, we should use a more objective term and then<br>SB&gt; qualify then note the equivalence for the security technical<br>SB&gt; community.<br><br>&nbsp;  An<br>&nbsp;  attack may change the content of the communication, record the<br>&nbsp;  content or external characteristics of the communication, or through<br>&nbsp;  correlation with other communication events, reveal information the<br>&nbsp;  parties did not intend to be revealed.&nbsp; It may also have other<br>&nbsp;  effects that similarly subvert the intent of a communicator.<br><br>SB&gt; I think that you are taking advantage of the technical definition<br>SB&gt; to introduce emotion rather than strict objectivity and impartiality.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC4949</a>] contains a more complete definition for the term attack.<br>&nbsp;  We also use the term in the singular here, even though PM in reality<br>&nbsp;  may require a multi-faceted set of coordinated attacks.<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, the term attack, used technically, implies nothing<br>&nbsp;  about the motivation of the actor mounting the attack.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  motivation for PM is not relevant for this document, but can range<br>&nbsp;  from non-targeted nation-state surveillance, to legal but privacy-<br>&nbsp;  unfriendly purposes by commercial enterprises, to illegal actions by<br>&nbsp;  criminals.&nbsp; The same techniques can be used regardless of motivation.<br>&nbsp;  Thus we cannot defend against the most nefarious actors while<br>&nbsp;  allowing monitoring by other actors no matter how benevolent some<br>&nbsp;  might consider them to be, since the actions required are<br>&nbsp;  indistinguishable from other attacks.<br><br><br>SB&gt; That is the crux of the dilemma and deserves to be more prominent.<br>SB&gt; I think the text "no matter how benevolent some might consider them"<br>SB&gt; is unnecessarily judgmental. We may all have different thresholds<br>SB&gt; for warranted analysis, but there are cases where most ordinary<br>SB&gt; people would consider the gathering of the information was <br>SB&gt; morally justified.<br><br><br><br>2.&nbsp; The IETF will work to Mitigate Pervasive Monitoring<br><br>&nbsp;  "Mitigation" is a technical term that does not imply an ability to<br>&nbsp;  completely prevent or thwart an attack.&nbsp; Protocols that mitigate PM<br>&nbsp;  will not prevent the attack, but can significantly change the threat.<br>&nbsp;  (See the diagram on page 24 of <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a> for how the terms attack and<br>&nbsp;  threat are related.)&nbsp; This can significantly increase the cost of<br>&nbsp;  attacking, force what was covert to be overt, or make the attack more<br>&nbsp;  likely to be detected, possibly later.<br><br>SB&gt; I am not sure forcing all monitoring to be overt is a good thing.<br>SB&gt; Overt implies detectability from outside the monitoring system<br>SB&gt; and its associated control environment. There are cases in law <br>SB&gt; enforcement where few would consider the complete removal of <br>SB&gt; undetectability desirable or morally defensible.<br><br>&nbsp;  IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet<br>&nbsp;  communications and there are guidelines [<a href="/doc/rfc3552/">RFC3552</a>] for applying these<br>&nbsp;  in protocol design.&nbsp; But those generally do not consider PM, the<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality of protocol meta-data, countering traffic analysis<br>&nbsp;  nor data minimisation.&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>] In all cases, there will remain<br>&nbsp;  some privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by<br>&nbsp;  protocols.&nbsp; As technology advances, techniques that were once only<br>&nbsp;  available to extremely well funded actors become more widely<br>&nbsp;  accessible.&nbsp; Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide<br>&nbsp;  range of similar attacks.<br><br>SB&gt; Maybe it's later, but I thought that we agreed that there were<br>SB&gt; operational reasons to gather some of the protocol artifacts.<br><br>&nbsp;  It is therefore timely to revisit the security and privacy properties<br>&nbsp;  of our standards.&nbsp; The IETF will work to mitigate the technical<br>&nbsp;  aspects of PM, just as we do for protocol vulnerabilities in general.<br>&nbsp;  The ways in which IETF protocols mitigate PM will change over time as<br>&nbsp;  mitigation and attack techniques evolve and so are not described<br>&nbsp;  here.<br><br>&nbsp;  Those developing IETF specifications need to be able to describe how<br>&nbsp;  they have considered PM, and, if the attack is relevant to the work<br>&nbsp;  to be published, be able to justify related design decisions.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  does not mean a new "pervasive monitoring considerations" section is<br>&nbsp;  needed in IETF documentation.&nbsp; It means that, if asked, there needs<br>&nbsp;  to be a good answer to the question "is pervasive monitoring relevant<br>&nbsp;  to this work and if so how has it been considered?"<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, architectural decisions, including which existing<br>&nbsp;  technology is re-used, may significantly impact the vulnerability of<br>&nbsp;  a protocol to PM.&nbsp; Those developing IETF specifications therefore<br>&nbsp;  need to consider mitigating PM when making these architectural<br>&nbsp;  decisions.&nbsp; Getting adequate, early review of architectural decisions<br>&nbsp;  including whether appropriate mitigation of PM can be made is<br>&nbsp;  important.&nbsp; Revisiting these architectural decisions late in the<br>&nbsp;  process is very costly.<br><br>SB&gt; For balance the following needs to be earlier in the text.<br>SB&gt; As it is here it is something of an afterthought which belittles<br>SB&gt; its legitimacy and importance.<br><br>&nbsp;  While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring can be beneficial<br>&nbsp;  and not part of any attack, e.g. network management functions monitor<br>&nbsp;  packets or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message<br>&nbsp;  content.&nbsp; Some monitoring can even be part of the mitigation for PM,<br>&nbsp;  for example Certificate Transparency [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] involves monitoring<br>&nbsp;  Public Key Infrastructure in ways that could detect some PM attack<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; There is though a clear potential for monitoring<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms to be abused for PM, so this tension needs careful<br>&nbsp;  consideration in protocol design.&nbsp; Making networks unmanageable to<br>&nbsp;  mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go<br>&nbsp;  against the consensus documented here.&nbsp; An appropriate balance will<br>&nbsp;  emerge over time as real instances of this tension are considered.<br><br>&nbsp;  Finally, the IETF, as a standards development organisation, does not<br>&nbsp;  control the implementation or deployment of our specifications<br>&nbsp;  (though IETF participants do develop many implementations), nor does<br>&nbsp;  the IETF standardise all layers of the protocol stack.&nbsp; Moreover, the<br>&nbsp;  non-technical (e.g. legal and political) aspects of mitigating<br>&nbsp;  pervasive monitoring are outside of the scope of the IETF.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  broader Internet community will need to step forward to tackle PM, if<br>&nbsp;  it is to be fully addressed.<br><br>&nbsp;  To summarise: current capabilities permit some actors to monitor<br>&nbsp;  content and meta-data across the Internet at a scale never before<br>&nbsp;  seen.&nbsp; This pervasive monitoring is an attack on Internet privacy.<br>SB&gt; Do you mean Internet privacy, or the privacy of Internet transactions?<br>SB&gt; Other than to prevent attack, or compromise the commercial secrets<br>SB&gt; of operators, I am not sure the Internet has any right to privacy.<br>SB&gt; On the other hand internet users have the right to have their<br>SB&gt; Internet transactions guarded to the degree agreed by their society.<br> <br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF will strive to produce specifications that mitigate<br>&nbsp;  pervasive monitoring attacks.<br><br>SB&gt; I think we mean appropriately mitigate, since the degree of<br>SB&gt; acceptable mitigation is a societal matter.<br><br> 3.&nbsp; Process Note<br><br>&nbsp;  In the past, architectural statements of this sort, e.g., [<a href="/doc/rfc1984/">RFC1984</a>]<br>&nbsp;  and [<a href="/doc/rfc2804/">RFC2804</a>] have been published as joint products of the Internet<br>&nbsp;  Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and the Internet Architecture Board<br>&nbsp;  (IAB).&nbsp; However, since those documents were published, the IETF and<br>&nbsp;  IAB have separated their publication "streams" as described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4844/">RFC4844</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc5741/">RFC5741</a>].&nbsp; This document was initiated by both the<br>&nbsp;  IESG and IAB, but is published as an IETF-stream consensus document,<br>&nbsp;  in order to ensure that it properly reflects the consensus of the<br>&nbsp;  IETF community as a whole.<br><br>&nbsp;  [[Note (to be removed before publication): This draft is written as<br>&nbsp;  if IETF consensus has been established for the text.]]<br><br><br>4.&nbsp; Security Considerations<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is entirely about privacy.&nbsp; More information about the<br>&nbsp;  relationship between security and privacy threats can be found in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>].&nbsp; Section 5.1.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC6973</a>] specifically addresses<br>&nbsp;  surveillance as a combined security-privacy threat.</div></td>
