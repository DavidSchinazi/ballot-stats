 In some deployment scenarios, the network security devices (Device<br>&nbsp;  Under Test/System Under Test) are connected to routers and switches,<br>&nbsp;  which will reduce the number of entries in MAC or ARP tables of the<br>&nbsp;  Device Under Test/System Under Test (DUT/SUT).&nbsp; If MAC or ARP tables<br>&nbsp;  have many entries, this may impact the actual DUT/SUT performance due<br>&nbsp;  to MAC and ARP/ND (Neighbor Discovery) table lookup processes.&nbsp; This<br><br>I understand the motivation for benchmarking the maximum performance from<br>the device under controlled circumstances, but it also seems that if a<br>device really will exhibit degraded performance due to the number of<br>entries in its MAC/ARP table, that would be useful information to have.<br>Perhaps a remark about how future work could include repeating<br>benchmarking results with different numbers of other devices on the local<br>network segment is in order.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Table 1 and Table 2 below describe the RECOMMENDED and OPTIONAL sets<br>&nbsp;  of network security feature list for NGFW and NGIPS respectively.<br><br>I agree with the IoTdir reviewer that Certificate Validation should surely<br>be a recommended feature for NGFWs.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |<br><br>This description could stand to be more clear, especially in light of the<br>fundamental differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.<br>First, the description starts off with "intercepts and decrypts" and then<br>goes on to say that once inspection is over, the DUT/SUT "encrypts the<br>HTTPS traffic".&nbsp; Does this mean that the DUT/SUT specifically needs to<br>re-encrypt after decrypting, or is it permissible to retain the original<br>ciphertext and just relay that ciphertext onward?<br>Second, in TLS 1.3, it is by construction impossible for a single set of<br>traffic encryption keys to be shared by all three of client, server, and<br>DUT/SUT -- RSA key transport is forbidden and ephemeral key exchange is<br>required.&nbsp; In order to perform content inspection, such a middlebox needs<br>to be able to impersonate the server to the client (i.e., holding a<br>certificate and private key that is trusted by the client and represents<br>the identity of the real server, which is expected to require specific<br>configuration on the client to enable) and complete separate TLS<br>connections to client and to server.&nbsp; In this scenario the middlebox must<br>remain as a "machine in the middle" for the duration of the entire<br>connection and decrypt/reencrypt all content using the different keys for<br>the client/middlebox and middlebox/server connections.<br><br>&nbsp;

If the requests are sent all at once the resulted throughput may look like a long file download and if they are sparse then they will look small downloads in a sparse timeline. Here, it is not clear to me what is the intention. Again the traffic profile is missing and I am started to think that Section 7.1.3.3 might be part of Section 7.1.3.2.<br><br>&nbsp; * Section 7.4 and 7.8 : I can have similar view as per my comment on Section 7.3.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents.

The scope of the document was<br>appropriately tightened during review. The process to achieve <br>consensus was long but smooth, and at no time was there sustained <br>controversy.<br><br>Document Quality: <br><br>There are at least two existing implementations of the test methods described in the memo, both full and partial. Many layers of review contributed to the quality of the document (authors, external NetSecOpen organization, and many working group participants sharing comments on bmwg-list).<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Al Morton is the Document Shepherd.<br>Warren Kumari is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The Doc Shepherd has reviewed this memo many times during development, and seen his comments addressed.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Review of the "next-generation" adjective prompted discussion, but the authors found that this adjective is in common use with the FW and NGIPS devices that are the target of this work. Also, the adjective helps to distinguish this work from the devices covered in the <a href="/doc/rfc3511/">RFC 3511</a> time-frame. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>I think that most of teh WG understands this document's goals and methods, and many members have reviewed the document in detail, according to their experience. The WG consensus is now clear.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Informational, all BMWG RFCs to date are Informational.<br>The status is correctly indicated on the title pages.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for<br>next-generation network security devices including next-generation<br>firewalls (NGFW), next-generation intrusion prevention systems<br>(NGIPS), and unified threat management (UTM) implementations.&nbsp; This<br>document aims to improve the applicability, reproducibility, and<br>transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with<br>today's increasingly complex layer 7 security centric network<br>application use cases.&nbsp; The main areas covered in this document are<br>test terminology, test configuration parameters, and benchmarking<br>methodology for NGFW and NGIPS.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Consensus for these drafts required several WGLC which prompted<br>careful review and further comments. The scope of the document was<br>appropriately tightened during review. The process to achieve <br>consensus was long but smooth, and at no time was there sustained <br>controversy.<br><br>Document Quality: <br><br>There are at least two existing implementations of the test methods described in the memo, both full and partial. Many layers of review contributed to the quality of the document (authors, external NetSecOpen organization, and many working group participants sharing comments on bmwg-list).<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Al Morton is the Document Shepherd.<br>Warren Kumari is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The Doc Shepherd has reviewed this memo many times during development, and seen his comments addressed.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One important comment remains to be addressed:<br>Since this memo Obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc3511/">RFC 3511</a>, a sentence indicating this action must be added to the Abstract according to current practice.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One additional comment on version 10:<br>The Security Directorate Review usually goes more smoothly when the Security Considerations section (9) re-enforces that the scope of this document is a laboratory Isolated Test Environment (and not production network testing). Sample text is available to use in this section, consistent with BMWG's lab-only charter.<br><br>Also, see a few "&gt;&gt;&gt;" below.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Review of the "next-generation" adjective prompted discussion, but the authors found that this adjective is in common use with the FW and NGIPS devices that are the target of this work. Also, the adjective helps to distinguish this work from the devices covered in the <a href="/doc/rfc3511/">RFC 3511</a> time-frame. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; message sent 10/16/2021 &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>I think that most of teh WG understands this document's goals and methods, and many members have reviewed the document in detail, according to their experience. The WG consensus is now clear.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The draft discusses the BMWG address assignments in this section (8). However, the draft makes no specific request of IANA, and should say that first.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Informational, all BMWG RFCs to date are Informational.<br>The status is correctly indicated on the title pages.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for<br>next-generation network security devices including next-generation<br>firewalls (NGFW), next-generation intrusion prevention systems<br>(NGIPS), and unified threat management (UTM) implementations.&nbsp; This<br>document aims to improve the applicability, reproducibility, and<br>transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with<br>today's increasingly complex layer 7 security centric network<br>application use cases.&nbsp; The main areas covered in this document are<br>test terminology, test configuration parameters, and benchmarking<br>methodology for NGFW and NGIPS.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Consensus for these drafts required several WGLC which prompted<br>careful review and further comments. The scope of the document was<br>appropriately tightened during review. The process to achieve <br>consensus was long but smooth, and at no time was there sustained <br>controversy.<br><br>Document Quality: <br><br>There are at least two existing implementations of the test methods described in the memo, both full and partial. Many layers of review contributed to the quality of the document (authors, external NetSecOpen organization, and many working group participants sharing comments on bmwg-list).<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Al Morton is the Document Shepherd.<br>Warren Kumari is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The Doc Shepherd has reviewed this memo many times during development, and seen his comments addressed.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One important comment remains to be addressed:<br>Since this memo Obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc3511/">RFC 3511</a>, a sentence indicating this action must be added to the Abstract according to current practice.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; One additional comment on version 10:<br>The Security Directorate Review usually goes more smoothly when the Security Considerations section (9) re-enforces that the scope of this document is a laboratory Isolated Test Environment (and not production network testing). Sample text is available to use in this section, consistent with BMWG's lab-only charter.<br><br>Also, see a few "&gt;&gt;&gt;" below.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Review of the "next-generation" adjective prompted discussion, but the authors found that this adjective is in common use with the FW and NGIPS devices that are the target of this work. Also, the adjective helps to distinguish this work from the devices covered in the <a href="/doc/rfc3511/">RFC 3511</a> time-frame. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; message sent 10/16/2021 &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>I think that most of teh WG understands this document's goals and methods, and many members have reviewed the document in detail, according to their experience. The WG consensus is now clear.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The draft discusses the BMWG address assignments in this section (8). However, the draft makes no specific request of IANA, and should say that first.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?
