If it is *not* redundant, you need to pull those things out and highlight them. I found myself jumping back and forth between this section and 4 and 5 trying to figure out what I missed. I couldn't find any differences. Keep the first sentence and the example; ditch the rest.<br><br>6.2: Skip the bits about client_assertion, client_assertion_type, Subject, Audience, and signature verification; they're redundant. Skip the first two sentences of "Issuer"; also redundant. Move the bit about STS into earlier sections; it gets re-used. Just keep the intro, the grant_type, and the example.<br><br>6.3 and 6.4 have similar issues to 6.1 and 6.2, and similar cleanups. I can go through in detail if you need, but I think you have the idea.</div></td>

Why is <br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title <br>page header?<br><br>The RFC type is 'Standards Track' and the type is indicated in the title <br>page. Although the document is architectural in nature it is the <br>umbrella document for two other 'Standards Track' specifications that <br>extend this document with SAML and JSON specific details. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement <br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent <br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  The Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 allows the use of assertions<br>&nbsp;  in the form of a new client authentication mechanism<br>&nbsp;  and a new authorization grant type.&nbsp; Mechanisms are specified for<br>&nbsp;  transporting assertions during interactions with a token endpoint, as<br>&nbsp;  well as general processing rules.<br><br>&nbsp;  The intent of this specification is to provide a common framework for<br>&nbsp;  OAuth 2.0 to interwork with other identity systems using assertions,<br>&nbsp;  and to provide alternative client authentication mechanisms.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that this specification only defines abstract message flows and<br>&nbsp;  processing rules.&nbsp; In order to be implementable, companion<br>&nbsp;  specifications are necessary to provide the corresponding concrete<br>&nbsp;  instantiations.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was <br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where <br>the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>There was no controversy around this document. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The working group decided to separate the framework for assertion <br>handling from instance documents supporting SAML assertion and JSON-<br>based encoded tokens. Readers who want to implement the functionality <br>also need to consult one of the extension documents, such as . <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Hannes Tschofenig and the responsible area <br>director is Stephen Farrell. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by <br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for <br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the <br>IESG.<br><br>The draft authors believe that this document is ready for publication. <br>The document shepherd has reviewed the document and provided detailed <br>comments. Those review comments have been taken into account and have <br>lead to clarifications regarding the claimed security benefits.&nbsp;  <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or <br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>This document has gotten feedback from the working group but certainly <br>not to the extend other OAuth working group documents, like the OAuth <br>Core specification and the OAuth Bearer Token specification, had <br>received. This can be explained by the focused use cases. The ability to <br>use assertions in the way described by the document is not needed in <br>every deployment. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from <br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, <br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took <br>place.<br><br>Additional feedback from the security community would be appreciated. <br>Also, it would be helpful to get additional reviews from outside the <br>group from people already using assertions to ensure that the use cases <br>and the offered security benefits are well understood.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd <br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the <br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable <br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really <br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and <br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those <br>concerns here.<br><br>The shepherd still believes that the document authors could have done a <br>better job in explaining the use cases for which the proposed <br>functionality are applicable. The concerns have been raised in http://<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg09961.html">www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg09961.html</a><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR <br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> <br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The shepherd has gotten a confirmation from the authors that no IPR <br>disclosures are needed. <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If <br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR <br>disclosures.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been filed. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being <br>silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Only a subset of working group participants have reviewed the document <br>but enough to move forward with the publication.&nbsp; However, because the <br>SAML and JWT Assertion Profiles based on it have been implemented and <br>are being used by a number of parties, we have high confidence in the <br>sufficiency and accuracy of the document text.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate <br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a <br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No appeal or extreme discontent has been raised. <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this <br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts <br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be <br>thorough.<br><br>The document has been verified and contains no nits. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review <br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>There is no such review necessary. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either <br>normative or informative?<br><br>Yes. <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for <br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative <br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? <br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No, there is no need for a downref. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing <br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the <br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed <br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of <br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs <br>is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why <br>the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>The publication of this document does not change the status of other <br>RFCs. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations <br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the <br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes <br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. <br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly <br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a <br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that <br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a <br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document adds three values to an existing registry established with <br><a href="/doc/rfc6749/">RFC 6749</a>. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future <br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful <br>in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The document only adds entries to existing registries and does not <br>define any new registries. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document <br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal <br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There are only snippets for examples and no pseudo code is contained <br>that requires validation. <br> <br></div></td>
