The intended type is indicated in the document header.<br>&nbsp;  <br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples<br>can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>and/or introduction of the document.

For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>&nbsp; This document was called <a href="/doc/draft-raghuvanshi-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery/">draft-raghuvanshi-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery</a> <br>&nbsp; prior to its adoption. There was unanimous support for it in favor of <br>&nbsp; adoption and none against), so this document was adopted in December <br>&nbsp; 2013. There was interest in this work posts since its adoption. <br>&nbsp; There was never any opposition for this work.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This document went through a relevant short document development<br>&nbsp; period (2 months for individual document period, 4 month for WG document <br>&nbsp; period). Its maturity took advantages from its twin-document - <br>&nbsp; "Active DHCPv4 Lease Query" <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-active-leasequery/">draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-active-leasequery</a>, <br>&nbsp; which firstly submitted in early 2010.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was<br>a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the <br>request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; I'm not aware of any existing implementations, but the authors claimed<br>&nbsp; they have customers using DHCPv4 active leasequery. It is reasonable to<br>&nbsp; assume these customers would require DHCPv6 active leasequery as long <br>&nbsp; as their network extend to IPv6. No external requirements are needed <br>&nbsp; as this work is purely DHCPv6 extension. There was a few reviews by<br>&nbsp; DHC WG members.

This document expands on the DHCPv6 Leasequery<br>&nbsp;  protocol, and allows for active transfer of real-time DHCPv6 binding<br>&nbsp;  information data via TCP.&nbsp; This document also extends the DHCPv6 Bulk <br>&nbsp;  Leasequery by adding new options and updates the DHCPv6 Bulk <br>&nbsp;  Leasequery. The intended type is indicated in the document header.<br>&nbsp;  <br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples<br>can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; This document enables an entity not directly involved in DHCPv6 <br>&nbsp; client - server transactions to keep current with the state of the<br>&nbsp; DHCPv6 lease state information in real-time.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>&nbsp; This document was called <a href="/doc/draft-raghuvanshi-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery/">draft-raghuvanshi-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery</a> <br>&nbsp; prior to its adoption. There was unanimous support for it in favor of <br>&nbsp; adoption and none against), so this document was adopted in December <br>&nbsp; 2013. There was interest in this work posts since its adoption. <br>&nbsp; There was never any opposition for this work.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This document went through a relevant short document development<br>&nbsp; period (2 months for individual document period, 4 month for WG document <br>&nbsp; period). Its maturity took advantages from its twin-document - <br>&nbsp; "Active DHCPv4 Lease Query" <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-active-leasequery/">draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-active-leasequery</a>, <br>&nbsp; which firstly submitted in early 2010.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was<br>a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the <br>request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; I'm not aware of any existing implementations, but the authors claimed<br>&nbsp; they have customers using DHCPv4 active leasequery. It is reasonable to<br>&nbsp; assume these customers would require DHCPv6 active leasequery as long <br>&nbsp; as their network extend to IPv6. No external requirements are needed <br>&nbsp; as this work is purely DHCPv6 extension. There was a few reviews by<br>&nbsp; DHC WG members. This document has requested publication in mid of 2014,<br>&nbsp; and received a AD review from Ted Lemon. The authors updated the <br>&nbsp; document in March 2015 to address the comments from AD review.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No. This document has been carefully reviewed by the DHC WG.<br>&nbsp; <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with<br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware<br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the<br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br>if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no outstanding issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.

The IPR declaration was submitted early on <br>&nbsp; but the WG did not explicitly discuss the ipr at any time (wglc or <br>&nbsp; otherwise) to my knowledge.<br>&nbsp; <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There was broad support for this document. It was reviewed by active WG <br>&nbsp; participants. All changes were mostly minor.<br>&nbsp; <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br>&nbsp; <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If such normative references<br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; All normative references are published RFCs.<br>&nbsp; <br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so,<br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call<br>procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc5460/">RFC 5460</a>. It is listed on the title page header, listed<br>&nbsp; in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA is asked to assign 3 option codes for OPTION_LQ_BASE_TIME, <br>&nbsp; OPTION_LQ_START_TIME, and OPTION_LQ_END_TIME; 2 status codes for DataMissing <br>&nbsp; CatchUpComplete; 1 message type for&nbsp; ACTIVELEASEQUERY.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; All the necessary information is in the IANA considerations document. It is<br>&nbsp; clear enough that the IANA will be able to implement it.<br>&nbsp; <br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such registry is requested in this document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no such parts to the document.</div></td>

Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA is asked to assign 3 option codes for OPTION_LQ_BASE_TIME, <br>&nbsp; OPTION_LQ_START_TIME, and OPTION_LQ_END_TIME; 2 status codes for DataMissing <br>&nbsp; CatchUpComplete; 1 message type for&nbsp; ACTIVELEASEQUERY.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; All the necessary information is in the IANA considerations document.

All changes were mostly minor.<br>&nbsp; <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br>&nbsp; <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; This document is now ID nits clean.<br>&nbsp; <br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such<br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No MIB Doctor, media type, URI type or similar apply to this<br>&nbsp; document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references<br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; All normative references are published RFCs.<br>&nbsp; <br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so,<br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call<br>procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not update any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA is asked to assign 3 option codes for OPTION_LQ_BASE_TIME, <br>&nbsp; OPTION_LQ_START_TIME, and OPTION_LQ_END_TIME; 2 status codes for DataMissing <br>&nbsp; CatchUpComplete; 1 message type for&nbsp; ACTIVELEASEQUERY.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; All the necessary information is in the IANA considerations document. It is<br>&nbsp; clear enough that the IANA will be able to implement it.<br>&nbsp; <br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such registry is requested in this document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no such parts to the document.</div></td>
