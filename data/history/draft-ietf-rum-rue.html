Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This review is written against <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-rum-rue/10/">draft-ietf-rum-rue-10</a> on 21-jan-2022.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by<br>&nbsp;  which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing<br>&nbsp;  or hearing impaired user using an interpreter ("Communications<br>&nbsp;  Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/hard of hearing/<br>&nbsp;  hearing impaired user and an audio telephone call to the hearing<br>&nbsp;  user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link<br>&nbsp;  and voice on the telephone link.&nbsp; Often the interpreters may be<br>&nbsp;  employed by a company or agency termed a "provider" in this document.<br>&nbsp;  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to<br>&nbsp;  connect video devices to their service, and subsequently to CAs and<br>&nbsp;  other deaf/hard of hearing/hearing impaired users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing<br>&nbsp;  impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used<br>&nbsp;  with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of<br>&nbsp;  hearing or hearing impaired users work.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  interface between a videophone and a provider.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There was not a lot of energy in the group to move the work along. Notably, the representatives of VRS providers were reluctant to contribute and mostly offered objections. Reaching consensus under these conditions was challenging and often consensus was quite rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is a partial implementation by Mitre. This is intended as a verification and test vehicle. They have committed to creating a full implementation when the document becomes an RFC.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>No. But the most likely vendors are the VRS providers. They do what they are required to do by the FCC. It is expected that the FCC will mandate this and then they will implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>No.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Shepherd: Paul Kyzivat<br>AD: Murray Kucherawy<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has actively reviewed and provided feedback and suggestions on every version of this document, and verified all the formal language-based content, and reviewed the results of IdNits.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>This version of the document addresses concerns raised in a security review of the prior version.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The market in which implementations of this document will primarily be deployed is unusual. The server side is controlled by a small set of VRS providers that are funded by the FCC and governed by rules issued by the FCC. The deployment of this standard will presumably be driven by new FCC requirements referencing it. The subject area covered by this document has heretofore been addressed with proprietary devices and/or software. The motivation for this work comes from outside the VRS provider community, while most people with experience building RUE-like devices work for the VRS providers. <br><br>There are compromises made with the VRS providers that have shaped the document in ways that is somewhat different from how it would have come out without their participation, yet the participation of these providers is deemed essential, and their co-operation is sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the rough consensus process has indeed overcome objections of all the participating providers, and they are not happy with certain aspects of the document.&nbsp; The shepherd is satisfied that the IETF processes on determining consensus were fairly applied, and the document represents a reasonable compromise between the providers as a whole and the rest of the work group.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Many IPR disclosures have been filed repeatedly against every new draft version of this document by one of the VRS providers. Based on a superficial examination, these seem to cover primarily features that impact downstream actions within the VRS provider and not the functionality addressed by this document. (Disclaimer, this is not a legal analysis.)<br><br>Participants have been afforded opportunities to suggest any changes in the document that may further avoid the IPR claimed in the patents, and no suggestions have been made.<br><br>Given the market in which this will be applied the current participants (all the VRS providers) clearly have already come to grips with the IPR environment. It is possible that an outsider who wants to create and sell a compatible RUE device might need to address some IPR issues. It isn't clear that there is any such candidate among the current participants of the work group.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus is reluctant. Many of the participants represent the interests of the VRS providers, and seemingly would prefer there be no such standard. (Presumably they assume they will be compelled by the FCC to support it.) However, despite repeated requests, their objections have not been accompanied by contribution of constructive alternatives.<br><br>The rest of the reviews and opinions come from more experienced IETF participants and they have generally been solidly in favor of the document as it now is constituted.&nbsp; In a few cases, some compromise has been achieved, where the more experienced IETFers would have preferred somewhat different text, but were persuaded the the compromise text was acceptable.&nbsp; Similarly, there are a few instances where the providers were initially against requirements deemed essential by our more experienced IETF participants, they offered some suggested additional requirements that the IETFers did not think were necessary, and they were accepted.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>Representatives of a major VRS provider have contacted this chairperson/shepherd with a request for guidance on how they may escalate their concerns. They were referred to the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IdNits reports some errors and warnings that are bogus:<br><br>* 3 instances of lines with non-ascii characters. These all appear in reference citations where they are now permitted. One of these is also reported as a line too long, due solely to the non-ascii character being counted as multiple bytes.<br> <br>* 2 warnings for "looks like a reference" for use of [1] and [2] in examples.<br><br>In addition three downrefs are reported, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>. These are discussed in (15) below.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>YES<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>NO<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are three downrefs, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a> is an informational RFC that describes how to use TLS to secure HTTP connections. The RUE document defines web interfaces that run securely over HTTPS and TLS. Doing so requires following the guidance in <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> is an informational RFC that describes how SIP entities handle early media.&nbsp; Early media is media that happens before a call is answered, which may be tones and announcements but also could be from an IVR system that doesn’t signal answer until a live agent answers the call.&nbsp; It’s the case that virtually every implementation has to do what <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> says because otherwise things don’t work, yet the text has no normative <a href="/doc/rfc119/">RFC119</a> language. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> documents an older way to request full frame refresh on a video stream that many older devices still use.&nbsp; To connect to them it is necessary to do what <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> says. We want that backward compatibility, so we required it.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>NO<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The definition of the new RUE Provider List registry is properly specified.<br><br>The update to the SIP Call-Info header field purpose is in good order.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The new RUE Provider List needs an expert. This is a per-country registry. The expert should ideally be comfortable working with this sort of regulatory environment. <br><br>The document editor, Brian Rosen, will volunteer to be the expert and there are other candidates who could be considered<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A<br><br></div></td>

it's an important topic and I look<br>forward to seeing interoperability in this space.<br><br>However, I don't think this document is quite ready for publication yet,<br>as it has a number of internal inconsistencies (and at least one<br>external inconsistency with IETF procedures) that would get in the way<br>of interoperable implementation.<br><br>(1) The procedure for substituting an entryPoint from the provider list into<br>the OpenAPI interface description for obtaining configuration data<br>appears to be incompatible with <a href="/doc/bcp190/">BCP 190</a>.&nbsp; Though there's not quite<br>enough detail for me to be able to tell exactly what behavior is<br>intended, the procedure of "replace localhost in the template with the<br>value from provider discovery" seems like it implies that the value from<br>provider discovery is just a hostname, and that we are requiring the RUM<br>services to be accessible via HTTP at path /rum/v1 on that machine.&nbsp; The<br>URI path namespace is under control of the owner of the host, and we<br>cannot assert that we will occupy that portion of the namespace.&nbsp; The<br>current version of <a href="/doc/bcp190/">BCP 190</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc8820/">RFC 8820</a>, does allow us to say (effectively)<br>"delegate a subtree of the path namespace to the protocol" by letting<br>the owner of the host pick what base path to use for the protocol (even<br>that would not have been allowed by its predecessor, <a href="/doc/rfc7320/">RFC 7320</a>), but we<br>do need to let that host-specific path prefix be indicated somehow,<br>whether by URL template or allowing a base path to be indicated in the<br>provider discovery process.<br><br>(2) There are a lot of inconsistencies about the parameters and data<br>format of the various API responses as specified in prose, OpenAPI<br>description, and examples.&nbsp; In particular, we also fail to make a clear<br>statement about whether the prose or the OpenAPI description is<br>normative and takes precedence in case of disagreement.<br><br>I'll list a bunch of things here; I made a fairly careful reading but am<br>not willing to assert that this is a comprehensive listing.&nbsp; (A number<br>of them also get comments in the section-by-section comments; sorry<br>about that duplication.)<br><br>Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 list configuration data items in the<br>"configuration data for new user sign up and dial around" and<br>"configuration data for the RUE" configuration retrieval APIs, and per<br>the note at the end of §9.2 they include the REQUIRED data items.<br>However, there are a couple data items that are mentioned elsewhere in<br>the document as if they are always going to be present, but are not<br>present in these lists of required configuration parameters.&nbsp; In<br>particular we talk about the "provider-domain" as coming from the<br>configuration, and it appears in examples, but is not mentioned in the<br>prose or OpenAPI format description.<br><br>The prose (and some examples) refer to an "outbound-proxies" RUE<br>configuration element, but §9.2.2 and the OpenAPI description list the<br>singular "outbound-proxy" (and with the corresponding difference in<br>format/structure).<br><br>The prose mentions "credentials" from the configuration, but no<br>parameter of that name appears (there is some mention of password under<br>"carddav" but that seems insufficiently generic to match all instances;<br>sip-password also exists).<br><br>"display-name" appears in the example in Figure 5 but is not listed in<br>§9.2.2<br><br>The prose for the provider configuration resource indicates that the<br>dialAround property is mandatory (it is not marked as "(OPTIONAL)"), but<br>the OpenAPI specification does not list this property as required.<br><br>The prose for the provider configuration's "signup" property says that<br>it is an array of JSON objects, but the OpenAPI description says that it<br>is just a single object (not an array).&nbsp; Likewise for "dialAround" and<br>"helpDesk".<br><br>The prose for "phone-number" specifies E.164 format, but the OpenAPI<br>description does not.<br><br>"carddav" is triply inconsistent: the prose says username, password, and<br>domain name are separated by "@" (presumably, in a single string), but<br>the example only shows username and domain name in user@domain form, and<br>the OpenAPI description says it should be an object with separate<br>properties for username/password/domain, as well as an additional<br>"sendLocationWithRegistration" property that is probably not supposed to<br>be a child of "carddav".<br><br>(repeating from the previous), the "sendLocationWithRegistration"<br>property is listed as belonging to the "carddav" object in the OpenAPI<br>description, though the prose and example indicate it should be a<br>property of the toplevel configuration object.<br><br>The prose and OpenAPI description indicate that "ice-servers" is an<br>array of strings, but the example has an array of objects that use the<br>dictionary key to indicate whether each URI is a TURN or STUN server.</div></td>

it may be useful to have a brief introductory mention of<br>the data flow involving registration and configuration retrieval and how<br>the two initialization processes (don't) interact.<br><br>I have a high-level comment or two about password usage in this<br>document.&nbsp; I recognize that we're constrained in practice by the current<br>state of SIP specification and the deployed ecosystem, but while<br>username/password may currently be the lowest common denominator for<br>authentication, it's far from best current practice.&nbsp; In a scenario<br>like the one here, where the RUE is a dedicated (often hardware)<br>product talking over a fixed protocol to a nearly fixed small set of<br>providers, there's plenty of scope for using strong cryptography to<br>authenticate the RUE, including public-key cryptography where the<br>verifier does not need to store any per-user secret information.&nbsp; At<br>present, Digest seems to be the strongest mechanism in the registry for<br>usage with SIP, but I would advise assuming that that will change in the<br>future and writing the spec and implementation in a way that is<br>compatible with stronger authentication schemes.<br><br>Furthermore, this document in several places (I note a few in the<br>per-secton comments) recommends or even requires the reuse of a<br>username/password pair across multiple services.&nbsp; Best practices are to<br>use any given password at exactly one service.&nbsp; In this regard one can<br>roughly model the password as analogous to a pre-shared key -- it is<br>useful for authenticating a peer in the sense that if the value is known<br>only to two entities, and the party you're communicating with proves<br>that they know the value, they must be the only other party that knows<br>the secret value.&nbsp; But once you reuse the password at multiple services,<br>that logic falls apart, as the party you're communicating with could be<br>the user, or it could be another service that shares the secret.<br>Granted, when used with digest the password itself is not sent to the<br>server for every authentication, but the server typically has access to<br>it at some point, and even possession of the password hash in a<br>verification database allows for offline brute-force attack, which has<br>become comparatively cheap in recent years and even the availability of<br>dedicated hardware for password cracking.<br><br>In particular, SHA-512 is not considered to be a best-practice hash<br>function for password hashing, since it is highly parallelizable and not<br>"memory-hard".&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc9106/">RFC 9106</a> specifies Argon2 (via the IRTF CFRG), the<br>winner of the password hashing competition; it is the state of the art<br>for password hashing, and even prior to that publication we had scrypt<br>available in <a href="/doc/rfc7914/">RFC 7914</a> that is a significant improvement on the SHA-2<br>family of functions.&nbsp; That said, it's not currently listed in the IANA<br>registry for hash algorithms for HTTP (and SIP) digest authentication,<br>so I am not sure that we can usefully advocate for its usage at the<br>present time.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>Thanks for mandating <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC 7525</a> compliance.&nbsp;

 All text data payloads not otherwise constrained by a specification<br>&nbsp;  in another standards document MUST be encoded as Unicode UTF-8.<br><br>I think we'd typically reference <a href="/doc/rfc8259/">RFC 8259</a> here.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 the realm the registrar uses in a digest challenge.&nbsp; This username/<br><br>Which entity is authenticating to which other entity here?&nbsp; The phrasing<br>" MAY authenticate" implies that it is X that is authenticating to<br>some other entity, but that does not seem to correspond to my model of<br>the flow here, where the RUE is authenticating to the registrar.&nbsp; If the<br>flow is to be the other way, we would say "the registrar MAY<br>authenticate the RUE using SIP digest authentication".<br><br>Also, I note that (HTTP) SCRAM authentication has superior security<br>properties to Digest, but unfortunately I don't see any evidence that<br>its use for SIP is defined yet.<br><br>Section 5.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;

Just saying "compatible with all<br>minor versions of the major version" would also make a statement about<br>forward compatibility, which I think is allowable under these rules for<br>what is allowed to change in minor versions, and it would be useful to<br>make a statement about forward compatibility.<br><br>Section 9.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The interface to obtain configuration data is described by an OpenAPI<br>&nbsp;  [OpenAPI] interface description.&nbsp; In that interface description, the<br>&nbsp;  "servers" component is specified as "localhost".&nbsp;

It may not be a direct "drop-in"<br>fit here, due to the need for a preexisting relationship with an<br>authorization server, but perhaps it is worth mentioning as an option<br>in addition to this provider-specific "API key" protocol?<br><br>&nbsp;  Also in both queries, the RUE device provides a required parameter<br>&nbsp;  which contains an instance identifier.&nbsp; This parameter MUST be the<br>&nbsp;  same value each time this instance (same implementation on same<br>&nbsp;  device) queries the interface.&nbsp; This MAY be used by the provider, for<br>&nbsp;  example, to associate a location with the instance for emergency<br>&nbsp;  calls.<br><br>Is there any cryptography to provide assurance that the instance<br>identifier is indeed always used only by the one single instance?&nbsp; The<br>description here sounds roughly like a bearer token, which is far from<br>best practice for this sort of thing.&nbsp; Indeed, in other contexts a given<br>instance is often identified solely by its public key, and must<br>authenticate with the corresponding private key in order to act as the<br>identified instance.<br><br>&nbsp;  The configuration API also provides the same version mechanism as<br>&nbsp;  specified above in Section 9.1.&nbsp; The version of the configuration<br>&nbsp;  service MAY be different than the version of the provider list<br>&nbsp;  service.<br><br>Not only that, but the services are expected to be versioned<br>independently, so there is no particular relationship between version<br>X.Y of the one and version X.Y of the other...right?<br><br>Actually, having gone and looked further, the OpenAPI document seems<br>to indicate that there's a single /Versions resource common across the<br>/Providers, /ProviderConfig, and /RueConfig APIs, which makes me<br>confused as to how the versions of the two services might actually be<br>different (let alone versioned independently).<br><br>Section 9.2.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; uri: a URI to the website for creating a new account in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  supported language.&nbsp; The new user signup URI may only initiate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  creation of a new account.&nbsp; Various vetting, approval and other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  processes may be needed, which could take time, before the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  account is established.&nbsp; The result of creating a new account<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  would be a username and password, which would be manually<br><br>I strongly suggest using a more generic phrasing (e.g., "would be<br>account credentials (e.g., username and password)") to allow for<br>seamless transition to stronger authentication technologies without<br>specification change.<br><br>Section 9.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; lifetime: (optional) Specifies how long (in seconds) the RUE MAY<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cache the configuration values.&nbsp; Values may not be valid when<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lifetime expires.&nbsp; If the RUE caches configuration values, it MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cryptographically protect them.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>In other contexts, "cryptographically protect" would mean to encrypt,<br>cryptographically sign, or compute a keyed MAC over the data.&nbsp; If the<br>intent here is just to record a cryptographic checksum of the data,<br>that's probably better stated in terms of a checksum.<br><br>In particular, this current text gives no indication of what threat the<br>cryptography is supposed to protect against, so implementations are<br>unlikely actually provide uniform protection against the intended<br>threat.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; sip-password: (optional) a password used for SIP, STUN and TURN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authentication.&nbsp; The RUE device retains this data, which must be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; stored securely.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Akin to the above, this doesn't indicate what threat "stored securely"<br>is intended to protect against.&nbsp; While I would *hope* that "protect<br>passwords" is instinctive to developers, I wouldn't want to rely on it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; password MUST be used.&nbsp; If it was never supplied, the password<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to authenticate to the configuration service is used for SIP,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STUN and TURN.<br><br>In the general case, this directive is a gaping security hole (exposing<br>the RUE's SIP credentials to arbitrary external STUN/TURN servers, for<br>example).&nbsp; I think we must qualify that the reuse of credentials is only<br>for the servers listed in the "ice-servers" configuration directive.<br>(And ideally we would not encourage reuse of credentials at all.)<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; carddav: (optional) A username, password and domain name<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (separated by ""@"") identifying a "CardDAV" server and account<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that can be used to synchronize the RUE's contact list with the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contact list managed by the provider.&nbsp; If username or password are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not supplied, the main account credentials are used.<br><br>There are three data items but only one separator listed.&nbsp; Is this<br>really to be "username@password@domain"?<br>It would be great if we could make ourselves more generic than<br>username+password as credentials, and (as mentioned previously) avoid<br>reuse of credentials.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; ice-servers: (optional) An array of URLs identifying STUN and TURN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; servers available for use by the RUE for establishing media<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; streams in calls via the provider.<br><br>Is any given entry required to offer both STUN and TURN services, or can<br>a server provide just one or the other?&nbsp; Both this text and my<br>understanding of the OpenAPI description seem to indicate that this is a<br>flat list intermingling STUN and TURN servers, but the example in Figure<br>5 seems to show each element of the array being a JSON object that<br>contains one or more of the keys "stun" and "turn".&nbsp; The structure in<br>that example would obviate any confusion about which services are<br>offered, and is probably preferred.<br><br>Section 9.2.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "contacts": "<a href="https://red.example.net:443/contacts/1dess45awd">https://red.example.net:443/contacts/1dess45awd</a>",<br><br>I suggest putting a bit more entropy in the URL, in the vein of<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/capability-urls/">https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/capability-urls/</a> (even if this resource<br>is likely to require the username+password authentication discussed<br>earlier).<br><br>&nbsp;

With this understanding I have some points which I believe worth discussing. <br><br>&nbsp; - WebRTC communication will be congestion and rate controlled. This will use RTCP feedbacks to make the rate control and congestion control happen in the WebRTC peers. On the WebRTC part of the leg, this RTCP feedbacks will be available according to the WebRTC specification. However, this specification does not discuss how those RTCP feedback will be converted from the RUI server to RUI client (i.e the gateway) direction and vice versa. This will require the gateway to have such conversion functions to actually work. what is the thinking here? has this been considered? as I am not sure how is the network looks like between the RUI client and RUI server, there might be the Internet connecting them hence need to have congestion controlled traffic.<br><br>&nbsp; - Thanks to Bernard Aboba for a comprehensive TSVART review of this draft and I would like to bring some issues, identified in that review, here to make sure they are addressed-<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * clarification on the use of ICE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * clarification on what is a WebRTC client, WebRTC server, gateway, RUI client and RUI server. I believe all four have been conceptually used in the specification without concretely defining their roles. for example - if server is mentioned it need to be distinguishable if it is WebRTC server or RUI server ( I noted that there are servers in this specification which are clearly understandable).</div></td>

It largely informs my DISCUSS.<br><br>1. If I understand correctly, this draft is not at all about interoperating with a WebRTC endpoint, instead borrowing some requirements from that family of specs rather than re-inventing the wheel. That's great, but putting that explicitly in the intro would be helpful.<br><br>2. In particular, the statement that RUE is a "non-browser endpoint" is confusing if it's not actually meant to interoperate with WebRTC. I *think* you're attempting to distinguish between WebRTC's browser-only requirements and endpoint requirements, but I could be wrong here.<br><br>3. In Section 5.5, you require conformance with <a href="/doc/rfc8835/">RFC8835</a> with a few vaguely worded exceptions. It would be helpful to actually go through that document enumerate exactly which normative statements in 8835 do not apply. That said, I'm not sure I agree with Bernard that 8835 requires *use* of ICE, rather than support, but maybe we can clarify this in the TSVART thread.<br><br>4. As Bernard points out, this ambiguity extends to IPv4 and 6 support. The 8835 requirements are specific to browsers, so they might not apply. If you require support for both, but not necessarily on the same device, it would be good to say so.<br><br>5. In Sec. 6, it says "This specification adopts the media specifications for WebRTC ([<a href="/doc/rfc8825/">RFC8825</a>])." Is this a normative statement? Must RUEs comply with the entirety of that document, or is this an informative statement and the real requirements are in the subsections of Sec 6? From the discussion, it sounds like you want to include the requirements for WebRTC "endpoints", but not for WebRTC "browsers". It would help to clarify all this.<br><br>It's also possible that my initial understanding is incorrect, in which case the later points don't make any sense and some explanatory text is needed.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by<br>&nbsp;  which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing<br>&nbsp;  or hearing impaired user using an interpreter ("Communications<br>&nbsp;  Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an<br>&nbsp;  audio telephone call to the hearing user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using<br>&nbsp;  sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.<br>&nbsp;  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency termed<br>&nbsp;  a "provider" in this document.&nbsp; The provider also provides a video<br>&nbsp;  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,<br>&nbsp;  and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing<br>&nbsp;  impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used<br>&nbsp;  with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of<br>&nbsp;  hearing or hearing impaired users work.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  interface between a videophone and a provider.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There was not a lot of energy in the group to move the work along. Notably, the representatives of VRS providers were reluctant to contribute and mostly offered objections. Reaching consensus under these conditions was challenging and often consensus was quite rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is a partial implementation by Mitre. This is intended as a verification and test vehicle. They have committed to creating a full implementation when the document becomes an RFC.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>No. But the most likely vendors are the VRS providers. They do what they are required to do by the FCC. It is expected that the FCC will mandate this and then they will implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>No.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Shepherd: Paul Kyzivat<br>AD: Murray Kucherawy<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has actively reviewed and provided feedback and suggestions on every version of this document, and verified all the formal language-based content, and reviewed the results of IdNits.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The normal security review will be important for this document and the shepherd will make sure the conclusions of that review are attended to carefully by the author and the working group.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The market in which implementations of this document will primarily be deployed is unusual. The server side is controlled by a small set of VRS providers that are funded by the FCC and governed by rules issued by the FCC. The deployment of this standard will presumably be driven by new FCC requirements referencing it. The subject area covered by this document has heretofore been addressed with proprietary devices and/or software. The motivation for this work comes from outside the VRS provider community, while most people with experience building RUE-like devices work for the VRS providers. <br><br>There are compromises made with the VRS providers that have shaped the document in ways that is somewhat different from how it would have come out without their participation, yet the participation of these providers is deemed essential, and their co-operation is sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the rough consensus process has indeed overcome objections of all the participating providers, and they are not happy with certain aspects of the document.&nbsp; The shepherd is satisfied that the IETF processes on determining consensus were fairly applied, and the document represents a reasonable compromise between the providers as a whole and the rest of the work group.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Many IPR disclosures have been filed repeatedly against every new draft version of this document by one of the VRS providers. Based on a superficial examination, these seem to cover primarily features that impact downstream actions within the VRS provider and not the functionality addressed by this document. (Disclaimer, this is not a legal analysis.)<br><br>Participants have been afforded opportunities to suggest any changes in the document that may further avoid the IPR claimed in the patents, and no suggestions have been made.<br><br>Given the market in which this will be applied the current participants (all the VRS providers) clearly have already come to grips with the IPR environment. It is possible that an outsider who wants to create and sell a compatible RUE device might need to address some IPR issues. It isn't clear that there is any such candidate among the current participants of the work group.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus is reluctant. Many of the participants represent the interests of the VRS providers, and seemingly would prefer there be no such standard. (Presumably they assume they will be compelled by the FCC to support it.) However, despite repeated requests, their objections have not been accompanied by contribution of constructive alternatives.<br><br>The rest of the reviews and opinions come from more experienced IETF participants and they have generally been solidly in favor of the document as it now is constituted.&nbsp; In a few cases, some compromise has been achieved, where the more experienced IETFers would have preferred somewhat different text, but were persuaded the the compromise text was acceptable.&nbsp; Similarly, there are a few instances where the providers were initially against requirements deemed essential by our more experienced IETF participants, they offered some suggested additional requirements that the IETFers did not think were necessary, and they were accepted.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No.<br><br>If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IdNits reports some errors and warnings that are bogus:<br><br>* 3 instances of lines with non-ascii characters. These all appear in reference citations where they are now permitted. One of these is also reported as a line too long, due solely to the non-ascii character being counted as multiple bytes.<br> <br>* 2 warnings for "looks like a reference" for use of [1] and [2] in examples.<br><br>In addition three downrefs are reported, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>. These are discussed in (15) below.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>YES<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>NO<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are three downrefs, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a> is an informational RFC that describes how to use TLS to secure HTTP connections. The RUE document defines web interfaces that run securely over HTTPS and TLS. Doing so requires following the guidance in <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> is an informational RFC that describes how SIP entities handle early media.&nbsp; Early media is media that happens before a call is answered, which may be tones and announcements but also could be from an IVR system that doesn’t signal answer until a live agent answers the call.&nbsp; It’s the case that virtually every implementation has to do what <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> says because otherwise things don’t work, yet the text has no normative <a href="/doc/rfc119/">RFC119</a> language. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> documents an older way to request full frame refresh on a video stream that many older devices still use.&nbsp; To connect to them it is necessary to do what <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> says. We want that backward compatibility, so we required it.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>NO<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The definition of the new RUE Provider List registry is properly specified.<br><br>The update to the SIP Call-Info header field purpose is in good order.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The new RUE Provider List needs an expert. This is a per-country registry. The expert should ideally be comfortable working with this sort of regulatory environment. <br><br>The document editor, Brian Rosen, will volunteer to be the expert and there are other candidates who could be considered<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by<br>&nbsp;  which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing<br>&nbsp;  or hearing impaired user using an interpreter ("Communications<br>&nbsp;  Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an<br>&nbsp;  audio telephone call to the hearing user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using<br>&nbsp;  sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.<br>&nbsp;  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency termed<br>&nbsp;  a "provider" in this document.&nbsp; The provider also provides a video<br>&nbsp;  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,<br>&nbsp;  and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing<br>&nbsp;  impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used<br>&nbsp;  with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of<br>&nbsp;  hearing or hearing impaired users work.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  interface between a videophone and a provider.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There was not a lot of energy in the group to move the work along. Notably, the representatives of VRS providers were reluctant to contribute and mostly offered objections. Reaching consensus under these conditions was challenging and often consensus was quite rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is a partial implementation by Mitre. This is intended as a verification and test vehicle. They have committed to creating a full implementation when the document becomes an RFC.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>No. But the most likely vendors are the VRS providers. They do what they are required to do by the FCC. It is expected that the FCC will mandate this and then they will implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>No.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Shepherd: Paul Kyzivat<br>AD: Murray Kucherawy<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has actively reviewed and provided feedback and suggestions on every version of this document, and verified all the formal language-based content, and reviewed the results of IdNits.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The normal security review will be important for this document and the shepherd will make sure the conclusions of that review are attended to carefully by the author and the working group.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The market in which implementations of this document will primarily be deployed is unusual. The server side is controlled by a small set of VRS providers that are funded by the FCC and governed by rules issued by the FCC. The deployment of this standard will presumably be driven by new FCC requirements referencing it. The subject area covered by this document has heretofore been addressed with proprietary devices and/or software. The motivation for this work comes from outside the VRS provider community, while most people with experience building RUE-like devices work for the VRS providers. <br><br>There are compromises made with the VRS providers that have shaped the document in ways that is somewhat different from how it would have come out without their participation, yet the participation of these providers is deemed essential, and their co-operation is sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the rough consensus process has indeed overcome objections of all the participating providers, and they are not happy with certain aspects of the document.&nbsp; The shepherd is satisfied that the IETF processes on determining consensus were fairly applied, and the document represents a reasonable compromise between the providers as a whole and the rest of the work group.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Many IPR disclosures have been filed repeatedly against every new draft version of this document by one of the VRS providers. Based on a superficial examination, these seem to cover primarily features that impact downstream actions within the VRS provider and not the functionality addressed by this document. (Disclaimer, this is not a legal analysis.)<br><br>Participants have been afforded opportunities to suggest any changes in the document that may further avoid the IPR claimed in the patents, and no suggestions have been made.<br><br>Given the market in which this will be applied the current participants (all the VRS providers) clearly have already come to grips with the IPR environment. It is possible that an outsider who wants to create and sell a compatible RUE device might need to address some IPR issues. It isn't clear that there is any such candidate among the current participants of the work group.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus is reluctant. Many of the participants represent the interests of the VRS providers, and seemingly would prefer there be no such standard. (Presumably they assume they will be compelled by the FCC to support it.) However, despite repeated requests, their objections have not been accompanied by contribution of constructive alternatives.<br><br>The rest of the reviews and opinions come from more experienced IETF participants and they have generally been solidly in favor of the document as it now is constituted.&nbsp; In a few cases, some compromise has been achieved, where the more experienced IETFers would have preferred somewhat different text, but were persuaded the the compromise text was acceptable.&nbsp; Similarly, there are a few instances where the providers were initially against requirements deemed essential by our more experienced IETF participants, they offered some suggested additional requirements that the IETFers did not think were necessary, and they were accepted.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No.<br><br>If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IdNits reports some errors and warnings that are bogus:<br><br>* 3 instances of lines with non-ascii characters. These all appear in reference citations where they are now permitted. One of these is also reported as a line too long, due solely to the non-ascii character being counted as multiple bytes.<br> <br>* 2 warnings for "looks like a reference" for use of [1] and [2] in examples.<br><br>In addition three downrefs are reported, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>. These are discussed in (15) below.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>YES<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>NO<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are three downrefs, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a> is an informational RFC that describes how to use TLS to secure HTTP connections.

 which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing<br>&nbsp;  or hearing impaired user using an interpreter ("Communications<br>&nbsp;  Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an<br>&nbsp;  audio telephone call to the hearing user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using<br>&nbsp;  sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.<br>&nbsp;  Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency termed<br>&nbsp;  a "provider" in this document.&nbsp; The provider also provides a video<br>&nbsp;  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,<br>&nbsp;  and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing<br>&nbsp;  impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used<br>&nbsp;  with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of<br>&nbsp;

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by<br>&nbsp;  which a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing<br>&nbsp;  user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via<br>&nbsp;  a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the<br>&nbsp;  hearing user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using sign language on the<br>&nbsp;  videophone link and voice on the telephone link.&nbsp; Often the<br>&nbsp;  interpreters may be supplied by a company or agency termed a<br>&nbsp;  "provider" in this document.&nbsp; The provider also provides a video<br>&nbsp;  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,<br>&nbsp;  and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a<br>&nbsp;  standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that<br>&nbsp;  video calls direct between deaf/HoH users work.&nbsp; This document<br>&nbsp;  specifies the interface between a videophone and a provider.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There was not a lot of energy in the group to move the work along. Notably, the representatives of VRS providers were reluctant to contribute and mostly offered objections. Reaching consensus under these conditions was challenging and often consensus was quite rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is a partial implementation by Mitre. This is intended as a verification and test vehicle. They have committed to creating a full implementation when the document becomes an RFC.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>No. But the most likely vendors are the VRS providers. They do what they are required to do by the FCC. It is expected that the FCC will mandate this and then they will implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>No.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Shepherd: Paul Kyzivat<br>AD: Murray Kucherawy<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has actively reviewed and provided feedback and suggestions on every version of this document, and verified all the formal language-based content, and reviewed the results of IdNits.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The normal security review will be important for this document and the shepherd will make sure the conclusions of that review are attended to carefully by the author and the working group.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The market in which implementations of this document will primarily be deployed is unusual. The server side is controlled by a small set of VRS providers that are funded by the FCC and governed by rules issued by the FCC. The deployment of this standard will presumably be driven by new FCC requirements referencing it. The subject area covered by this document has heretofore been addressed with proprietary devices and/or software. The motivation for this work comes from outside the VRS provider community, while most people with experience building RUE-like devices work for the VRS providers. <br><br>There are compromises made with the VRS providers that have shaped the document in ways that is somewhat different from how it would have come out without their participation, yet the participation of these providers is deemed essential, and their co-operation is sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the rough consensus process has indeed overcome objections of all the participating providers, and they are not happy with certain aspects of the document.&nbsp; The shepherd is satisfied that the IETF processes on determining consensus were fairly applied, and the document represents a reasonable compromise between the providers as a whole and the rest of the work group.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Many IPR disclosures have been filed repeatedly against every new draft version of this document by one of the VRS providers. Based on a superficial examination, these seem to cover primarily features that impact downstream actions within the VRS provider and not the functionality addressed by this document. (Disclaimer, this is not a legal analysis.)<br><br>Participants have been afforded opportunities to suggest any changes in the document that may further avoid the IPR claimed in the patents, and no suggestions have been made.<br><br>Given the market in which this will be applied the current participants (all the VRS providers) clearly have already come to grips with the IPR environment. It is possible that an outsider who wants to create and sell a compatible RUE device might need to address some IPR issues. It isn't clear that there is any such candidate among the current participants of the work group.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus is reluctant. Many of the participants represent the interests of the VRS providers, and seemingly would prefer there be no such standard. (Presumably they assume they will be compelled by the FCC to support it.) However, despite repeated requests, their objections have not been accompanied by contribution of constructive alternatives.<br><br>The rest of the reviews and opinions come from more experienced IETF participants and they have generally been solidly in favor of the document as it now is constituted.&nbsp; In a few cases, some compromise has been achieved, where the more experienced IETFers would have preferred somewhat different text, but were persuaded the the compromise text was acceptable.&nbsp; Similarly, there are a few instances where the providers were initially against requirements deemed essential by our more experienced IETF participants, they offered some suggested additional requirements that the IETFers did not think were necessary, and they were accepted.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No.<br><br>If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IdNits reports some errors and warnings that are bogus:<br><br>* 3 instances of lines with non-ascii characters. These all appear in reference citations where they are now permitted. One of these is also reported as a line too long, due solely to the non-ascii character being counted as multiple bytes.<br> <br>* 2 warnings for "looks like a reference" for use of [1] and [2] in examples.<br><br>In addition two downrefs are reported, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>. These are discussed in (15) below.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>YES<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>NO<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are two downrefs, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> is an informational RFC that describes how SIP entities handle early media.&nbsp; Early media is media that happens before a call is answered, which may be tones and announcements but also could be from an IVR system that doesn’t signal answer until a live agent answers the call.&nbsp; It’s the case that virtually every implementation has to do what <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> says because otherwise things don’t work, yet the text has no normative <a href="/doc/rfc119/">RFC119</a> language. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> documents an older way to request full frame refresh on a video stream that many older devices still use.&nbsp; To connect to them it is necessary to do what <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> says. We want that backward compatibility, so we required it.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>NO<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The update to the SIP Call-Info header field purpose is in good order.<br><br>* The IANA Considerations for the new RUE Provider List registry call for a URI, while the text calls for a domain name. The author has been informed and has committed to updating this in the next version to specify a URI in the IANA Considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The new RUE Provider List needs an expert. This is a per-country registry. The expert should ideally be comfortable working with this sort of regulatory environment. <br><br>The document editor, Brian Rosen, will volunteer to be the expert and there are other candidates who could be considered<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A<br><br></div></td>

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by<br>&nbsp;  which a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing<br>&nbsp;  user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via<br>&nbsp;  a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the<br>&nbsp;  hearing user.&nbsp; The CA interprets using sign language on the<br>&nbsp;  videophone link and voice on the telephone link.&nbsp; Often the<br>&nbsp;  interpreters may be supplied by a company or agency termed a<br>&nbsp;  "provider" in this document.&nbsp; The provider also provides a video<br>&nbsp;  service that allows users to connect video devices to their service,<br>&nbsp;  and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH users.&nbsp; It is desirable<br>&nbsp;  that the videophones used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a<br>&nbsp;  standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that<br>&nbsp;  video calls direct between deaf/HoH users work.&nbsp; This document<br>&nbsp;  specifies the interface between a videophone and a provider.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There was not a lot of energy in the group to move the work along. Notably, the representatives of VRS providers were reluctant to contribute and mostly offered objections. Reaching consensus under these conditions was challenging and often consensus was quite rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is a partial implementation by Mitre. This is intended as a verification and test vehicle. They have committed to creating a full implementation when the document becomes an RFC.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>No. But the most likely vendors are the VRS providers. They do what they are required to do by the FCC. It is expected that the FCC will mandate this and then they will implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>No.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Shepherd: Paul Kyzivat<br>AD: Murray Kucherawy<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has actively reviewed and provided feedback and suggestions on every version of this document, and verified all the formal language-based content, and reviewed the results of IdNits.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The normal security review will be important for this document and the shepherd will make sure the conclusions of that review are attended to carefully by the author and the working group.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The market in which implementations of this document will primarily be deployed is unusual. The server side is controlled by a small set of VRS providers that are funded by the FCC and governed by rules issued by the FCC. The deployment of this standard will presumably be driven by new FCC requirements referencing it. The subject area covered by this document has heretofore been addressed with proprietary devices and/or software. The motivation for this work comes from outside the VRS provider community, while most people with experience building RUE-like devices work for the VRS providers. <br><br>There are compromises made with the VRS providers that have shaped the document in ways that is somewhat different from how it would have come out without their participation, yet the participation of these providers is deemed essential, and their co-operation is sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the rough consensus process has indeed overcome objections of all the participating providers, and they are not happy with certain aspects of the document.&nbsp; The shepherd is satisfied that the IETF processes on determining consensus were fairly applied, and the document represents a reasonable compromise between the providers as a whole and the rest of the work group.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Many IPR disclosures have been filed repeatedly against every new draft version of this document by one of the VRS providers. Based on a superficial examination, these seem to cover primarily features that impact downstream actions within the VRS provider and not the functionality addressed by this document. (Disclaimer, this is not a legal analysis.)<br><br>Participants have been afforded opportunities to suggest any changes in the document that may further avoid the IPR claimed in the patents, and no suggestions have been made.<br><br>Given the market in which this will be applied the current participants (all the VRS providers) clearly have already come to grips with the IPR environment. It is possible that an outsider who wants to create and sell a compatible RUE device might need to address some IPR issues. It isn't clear that there is any such candidate among the current participants of the work group.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus is reluctant. Many of the participants represent the interests of the VRS providers, and seemingly would prefer there be no such standard. (Presumably they assume they will be compelled by the FCC to support it.) However, despite repeated requests, their objections have not been accompanied by contribution of constructive alternatives.<br><br>The rest of the reviews and opinions come from more experienced IETF participants and they have generally been solidly in favor of the document as it now is constituted.&nbsp; In a few cases, some compromise has been achieved, where the more experienced IETFers would have preferred somewhat different text, but were persuaded the the compromise text was acceptable.&nbsp; Similarly, there are a few instances where the providers were initially against requirements deemed essential by our more experienced IETF participants, they offered some suggested additional requirements that the IETFers did not think were necessary, and they were accepted.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No.<br><br>If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IdNits reports some errors and warnings that are bogus:<br><br>* 3 instances of lines with non-ascii characters. These all appear in reference citations where they are now permitted. One of these is also reported as a line too long, due solely to the non-ascii character being counted as multiple bytes.<br> <br>* 2 warnings for "looks like a reference" for use of [1] and [2] in examples.<br><br>In addition two downrefs are reported, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>. These are discussed in (15) below.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>YES<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>NO<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are two downrefs, referencing <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a>.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> is an informational RFC that describes how SIP entities handle early media.&nbsp; Early media is media that happens before a call is answered, which may be tones and announcements but also could be from an IVR system that doesn’t signal answer until a live agent answers the call.&nbsp; It’s the case that virtually every implementation has to do what <a href="/doc/rfc3960/">RFC3960</a> says because otherwise things don’t work, yet the text has no normative <a href="/doc/rfc119/">RFC119</a> language. Hence we made this a normative reference.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> documents an older way to request full frame refresh on a video stream that many older devices still use.&nbsp; To connect to them it is necessary to do what <a href="/doc/rfc5168/">RFC5168</a> says. We want that backward compatibility, so we required it.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>NO<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The update to the SIP Call-Info header field purpose is in good order.<br><br>* The IANA Considerations for the new RUE Provider List registry call for a URI, while the text calls for a domain name. The author has been informed and has committed to updating this in the next version to specify a URI in the IANA Considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The new RUE Provider List needs an expert. This is a per-country registry. The expert should ideally be comfortable working with this sort of regulatory environment. <br><br>The document editor, Brian Rosen, will volunteer to be the expert and there are other candidates who could be considered<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The shepherd verified the json using the tool jsonlint , and the OpenAPI 3.1 descriptions of the interfaces using .<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A<br><br></div></td>
