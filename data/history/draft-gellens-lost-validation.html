Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>&nbsp;  The authors request publication as an Informational RFC. The draft registers a new U-NAPTR application service tag. The registration policy for that registry requires an RFC of any type.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary <br><br>&nbsp; This document adds the LoST-Validation service tag to the S-NAPTR Application Service Tag IANA registry.&nbsp; This tag is used by clients<br>&nbsp; of the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST). The use of this tag for service discovery allows the separation of a&nbsp; LoST location<br>&nbsp; validation service from the LoST mapping/routing service, as contemplated by the NENA i3 architecture.<br><br>Working Group Summary <br><br>&nbsp;  This document has not been discussed in a working group. It has had some brief discussion on the ART area mailing list. <br>&nbsp; LoST (<a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a>) was originally specified by the ECRIT working group. (Update: The authors posted the draft to the ECRIT mailing<br>&nbsp; list on 21 February, 2020. Additionally, the IETF LC was cross-posted to ECRIT and ART).<br><br>Document Quality <br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>The service tag is expected to be used by LoST products designed to be used with the NENA i3 architecture. The service tag registration was reviewed on the ART area mailing<br>list. That review resulted in editorial comments from Ted Hardie.<br><br>Personnel <br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>&nbsp;  The shepherd is Ben Campbell. The responsible AD is Barry Leiba.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The shepherd has checked nits, reviewed the document in detail, checked registration policies for the affected registry, as well as refreshed his memory on LoST (<a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a>).<br>He made editorial comments that have been addressed.&nbsp; Since this draft is expected to be AD sponsored, the shepherd leaves the readiness-for-publication decision to the sponsoring AD.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The shepherd would have liked to see review in the the ECRIT working group, since this document is related to <a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a>, which was a product of ECRIT. <br>However, the shepherd recognizes that ECRIT may not have sufficient participation at this time to perform an in-depth review, and that this is a<br>fairly simple service tag registration. (Update: The draft was posted to the ECRIT list on 21 February).<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Please see the answer to question number 4. Otherwise, the document received review on the ART list in the context of registration of a DNS S-NAPTR application service tag. <br>The shepherd does not believe the document needs review from other perspectives.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the interested community has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd recommends that the ART ADs consider whether the LoST service split enabled by this this registration and contemplated by the NENA i3 architecture needs additional specification (perhaps in another document) or creates backwards-compatibility issues with <a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a> based LoST clients. (Update: Version 5 adds a section on<br>backwards compatibility.)<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why. <br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There are no current disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the consensus of the interested community behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the interested community as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus would best be characterized as from a small group of individuals, with others being silent. However, this is a short IANA registration document. It concerns emergency calling services, which has only a small community of experts in the IETF (a substantial fraction of which are authors). The shepherd would have been <br>surprised to see wide-spread participation.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IDNits gives the draft a clean bill of health.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The shepherd is not aware of any formal review requirements that would apply to this draft beyond the normal IETF consensus process. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the interested community considers it unnecessary. <br><br>The draft does not currently change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The shepherd reviewed the IANA considerations against the body of the draft and the registration policy of the affected registry. The affected registry is clearly identified.<br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The draft does not use formal languages.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft does not contain a YANG module.</div></td>

In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>The service tag is expected to be used by LoST products designed to be used with the NENA i3 architecture.

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Please see the answer to question number 4. Otherwise, the document received review on the ART list in the context of registration of a DNS S-NAPTR application service tag. <br>The shepherd does not believe the document needs review from other perspectives.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the interested community has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd recommends that the ART ADs consider whether the LoST service split enabled by this this registration and contemplated by the NENA i3 architecture needs additional specification (perhaps in another document) or creates backwards-compatibility issues with <a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a> based LoST clients.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why. <br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There are no current disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the consensus of the interested community behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the interested community as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus would best be characterized as from a small group of individuals, with others being silent. However, this is a short IANA registration document. It concerns emergency calling services, which has only a small community of experts in the IETF (a substantial fraction of which are authors). The shepherd would have been <br>surprised to see wide-spread participation.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IDNits gives the draft a clean bill of health.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The shepherd is not aware of any formal review requirements that would apply to this draft beyond the normal IETF consensus process. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the interested community considers it unnecessary. <br><br>The draft does not currently change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The shepherd reviews the IANA considerations against the body of the draft and the registration policy of the affected registry. The affected registry is clearly identified.<br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The draft does not use formal language.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The shepherd has checked nits, reviewed the document in detail, checked registration policies for the affected registry, as well as refreshed his memory on LoST (<a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a>).<br>He made editorial comments that have been addressed.&nbsp; Since this draft is expected to be AD sponsored, the shepherd leaves the readiness-for-publication decision to the sponsoring AD.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The shepherd would have liked to see review in the the ECRIT working group, since this document is related to <a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a>, which was a product of ECRIT. <br>However, the shepherd recognizes that ECRIT may not have sufficient participation at this time to perform an in-depth review, and that this is a<br>fairly simple service tag registration.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Please see the answer to question number 4. Otherwise, the document received review on the ART list in the context of registration of a DNS S-NAPTR application service tag. <br>The shepherd does not believe the document needs review from other perspectives.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the interested community has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd recommends that the ART ADs consider whether the LoST service split enabled by this this registration and contemplated by the NENA i3 architecture needs additional specification (perhaps in another document) or creates backwards-compatibility issues with <a href="/doc/rfc5222/">RFC 5222</a> based LoST clients.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why. <br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There are no current disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the consensus of the interested community behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the interested community as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus would best be characterized as from a small group of individuals, with others being silent. However, this is a short IANA registration document. It concerns emergency calling services, which has only a small community of experts in the IETF (a substantial fraction of which are authors). The shepherd would have been <br>surprised to see wide-spread participation.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IDNits gives the draft a clean bill of health.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The shepherd is not aware of any formal review requirements that would apply to this draft beyond the normal IETF consensus process. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the interested community considers it unnecessary. <br><br>The draft does not currently change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The shepherd reviews the IANA considerations against the body of the draft and the registration policy of the affected registry. The affected registry is clearly identified.<br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>There are no newly created registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The draft does not use formal language.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft does not contain a YANG module.</div></td>
