I think in -11 we've probably gotten as far<br>as we're likely to agree upon in terms of addressing those (which<br>is far enough for me to change from a discuss to a no-objection<br>ballot) and we can work further on the topic as specific protocols <br>that adhere to this architecture emerge.<br><br>I didn't check if the (non-blocking) comments below were<br>taken into account or not in -11. If we need to chat about <br>any of them feel to ping me.<br><br>OLD COMMENTS BELOW<br><br>- It occurs to me that it might really be better for the WG<br>to not publish this as an RFC now, but rather to put it on<br>hold until they've made progress on the solutions. Perhaps<br>revistiting this when the solutions are just at WGLC would<br>result in the eventual RFC being a much more useful document.<br>I think this one has to hedge so many bets that it's quite<br>vague and won't be very useful even in the medium term. But<br>that's just a suggestion, I can see why the WG might prefer<br>to push this out, even if that might only give the appearance<br>of progress and not reflect real progress.<br><br>- While IPR on an architecture document is sad to see, esp<br>with what seems like it may be restrictive licensing, I do<br>see the wg debated that and decided to move on.<br><br>- The charter text describing this deliverable notes that<br>"The initial scope is restricted to a single administrative<br>domain, keeping in mind that architectural decisions made for<br>the intra-domain case may have implications for the<br>inter-domain case." So I think there is also a currently<br>missing analysis (or the results of that) as to how the<br>single-domain elements of this architecture might impinge on<br>a later inter-domain architecture. So the text at the <br>end of section 1.1 appears to contradict the chartered <br>goals.<br><br>- Chains will require some representation, and re-ordering<br>that is security sensitive (e.g. swap order of f/w and nat<br>for fun) therefore there must be a requirement for some data<br>integrity service and origin authentication and an<br>authorisation decision function and therefore there must<br>(istm) be a need for the architecture to define a chain<br>producing entity of some kind that could be authenticated.<br>That is an example of the missing security analysis that<br>really is needed before this proceeds. (See my discuss point<br>2)<br><br>- 1.1: "classified on ingress" and applicable to mobile<br>networks are slightly incongrous. In the case of WiFi when do<br>the packet ingress? (When it gets to the AP or leaves the<br>mobile node transmitter?) I suspect you really mean the wired<br>bits of a mobile network so it might be better to say that.<br><br>- 1.2 should follow 1.3 I think.<br><br>- 1.2: What does "chaining logic" mean? You say there's no<br>standard chaining logic, which is maybe right, but then you<br>imply that a fully ordered set of SF's is a well defined<br>thing. I'm not sure that makes sense. Perhaps what you want<br>to say is that the architecture doesn't determine if an SFC<br>{{A,B},C} is or is not the same as {{B,A},C} but that later<br>protocol work will have to do that. (In fact, I think you<br>could say a lot more here and probably should.)<br><br>- 1.2: what is a "chaining policy"? Isn't here where those<br>terms need to be defined.<br><br>- 1.3: SFC definition: by ordered do you mean fully or<br>partially ordered?<br><br>- 1.3: I'd omit LI as a SF - we won't be standardising that<br>(cf. <a href="/doc/rfc2804/">RFC2804</a>) so better to not drag in the controversy<br>really. Similarly, HOST_ID injection is not afaik any kind of<br>standard and perhaps not likely to be (cf. some confict<br>reviews on the same telechat as this) so I'd also drop that.<br>And I think all of the exemplar SF's should really have a<br>reference (ideally an RFC).<br><br>- Figure 1 caption is misleading. That seems to me to show a<br>set of paths through (one or more) graphs but doesn't show<br>the full graphs themselves.<br><br>- 2.2: The concept of a bi-directional SFC seems odd.&nbsp; Does<br>the example given imply that all traffic (of what kind?) that<br>followed SF1-&gt;SF2-&gt;SF3 on the way "in" must follow<br>SF3-&gt;SF2-&gt;SF1 on the way "out"? If so, then I think more<br>precision is needed really. The hybrid concept seems even<br>odder to me.<br><br>- 2.3: How can an SFP "be vague" - surely the point of an<br>architecture is to avoid such vagueness? If you mean that an<br>SFP representation can embody an if-statement then saying<br>that would be the thing to do.<br><br>- Section 3: I think there's maybe a missing principle here<br>about not making security and privacy worse in general.<br><br>- 4.1: I wonder if one could ever get enough SFC control<br>traffic that congestion would be an issue?&nbsp; If so, should you<br>say rather that any transport that has some way of handling<br>congestion is ok. If not, then I guess the current text is<br>fine.</div></td>
