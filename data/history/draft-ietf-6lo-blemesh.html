This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?<br>Shepherd response:&nbsp; Proposed Standard.<br>The document enables IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth Low Energy links (based on BLE<br>IPSP profile). The document mandates and in some cases recommends certain IPv6<br>procedures.<br><br>b. Why is this the proper type of RFC?<br>Rsp: 'Standards Track' document is needed to mandate and recommend certain<br>handling (such as some aspects of Neighbor Discovery, Header Compression etc).<br><br>c. Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br>Rsp: Yes<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Shepherd response: <br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document enables IPv6 mesh over BLE networks. For enabling IPv6 mesh,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the document specifies the use of Neighbor discovery, header compression<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and address autoconfiguration in context to multi-hop BLE links. The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document utilizes BLE's IPSP profile support which can be used for IPv6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; communication on top of BLE links. Note however that the use of routing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; protocol is required for routing the packets and choosing appropriate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parent set etc and is beyond the scope of this document.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>Shepherd response: <br> This draft has been discussed by 6lo working group and some of the BLE SIG<br> experts.<br>- Several WG participants provided feedback namely,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Bilhanan Silverajan who pointed out that the draft refers to an old BLE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; spec of 4.1 and that another spec has already superseded and should be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; used.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. Pascal Thubert pointed out the impact of <a href="/doc/rfc6775/">RFC 6775</a> updates on this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document and suggested the updates.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c. Rahul Jadhav pointed out that the registration of link-local addresses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cannot be mandated and there are reasons to send packets without header<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; compression in some cases. Similarly the mandate to use multihop DAD was<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussed and removed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; All the feedbacks were handled and subsequent updates reviewed/accepted by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the reviewers.<br>- version 06 was the final version reviewed by the shepherd, which resulted in<br>&nbsp; ver-07. Primary changes were related to consistent application of EARO in<br>&nbsp; place of ARO and suggested use of a call flow diagram to explain the node<br>&nbsp; joining procedure.<br><br>With these reviews and discussions -07 is ready for IESG review.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? <br>Shepherd response: <br>The authors have a prototype implementation but there is no production<br>implementation.<br><br>&nbsp;  Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br>Shepherd response: <br>Bilhanan Silverajan, Pascal Thubert, and Rahul Jadhav have reviewed and<br>provided comments and the drafts were subsequently updated. The review<br>encompassed several rounds.&nbsp; Yong-Geun Hong and Houjianqiang (Derek) have<br>reviewed and found no issues.<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br>Shepherd response: Not Applicable<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Rahul Jadhav<br>Responsible Area Director: Erik Kline<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>Shepherd response: <br>I have reviewed the document and my comments are addressed in version 07 that I<br>think is ready for IESG review.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>Shepherd response: No concerns<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>Shepherd response:<br>The document extends <a href="/doc/rfc7668/">RFC 7668</a> for using IPv6 mesh primitives based on BLE IPSP<br>profile. Mark Powell from Bluetooth SIG and an expert BLE (linux kernel)<br>implementor Alain Michaud had reviewed the document. The document may not need<br>a review from any other IETF directorate as part of the IESG processing.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>Shepherd response: No concerns<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>Shepherd response: All the authors have confirmed, no IPRs found.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>Shepherd response: Yes, all the authors have explicitly made a disclosure.<br>There are no IPRs on the draft as of now.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>Shepherd response: There have been 3 active comment providers and 2 other WG<br>participants (all from different backgrounds) who indicated that they have<br>reviewed the document and believe that it is ready for IESG submission. There<br>have been several voices indicating usefulness of the draft with no one voicing<br>any discontent.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>Shepherd response: No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>Shepherd response: None<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br>Shepherd response:<br>The only downref listed is about IPSP. I found that the ref is included in the<br>normative section as it needs to be read/understood before the implementation<br>based on this draft could be handled.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>Shepherd response: There are no updates to existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br>Shepherd response: No IANA registries are updated by the document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br>Shepherd response: No IANA registries are updated.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>Shepherd response: Not applicable as there are no formal language constructs in<br>the document.<br></div></td>

The document mandates and in some cases recommends certain IPv6<br>procedures.<br><br>b. Why is this the proper type of RFC?<br>Rsp: 'Standards Track' document is needed to mandate and recommend certain<br>handling (such as some aspects of Neighbor Discovery, Header Compression etc).<br><br>c. Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br>Rsp: Yes<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Shepherd response: <br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document enables IPv6 mesh over BLE networks. For enabling IPv6 mesh,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the document specifies the use of Neighbor discovery, header compression<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and address autoconfiguration in context to multi-hop BLE links. The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document utilizes BLE's IPSP profile support which can be used for IPv6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; communication on top of BLE links. Note however that the use of routing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; protocol is required for routing the packets and choosing appropriate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parent set etc and is beyond the scope of this document.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>Shepherd response: <br> This draft has been discussed by 6lo working group and some of the BLE SIG<br> experts.<br>- Several WG participants provided feedback namely,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Bilhanan Silverajan who pointed out that the draft refers to an old BLE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; spec of 4.1 and that another spec has already superseded and should be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; used.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. Pascal Thubert pointed out the impact of <a href="/doc/rfc6775/">RFC 6775</a> updates on this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document and suggested the updates.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c. Rahul Jadhav pointed out that the registration of link-local addresses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cannot be mandated and there are reasons to send packets without header<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; compression in some cases. Similarly the mandate to use multihop DAD was<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussed and removed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; All the feedbacks were handled and subsequent updates reviewed/accepted by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the reviewers.<br>- version 06 was the final version reviewed by the shepherd, which resulted in<br>&nbsp; ver-07. Primary changes were related to consistent application of EARO in<br>&nbsp; place of ARO and suggested use of a call flow diagram to explain the node<br>&nbsp; joining procedure.<br><br>With these reviews and discussions -07 is ready for IESG review.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? <br>Shepherd response: <br>The authors have a prototype implementation but there is no production<br>implementation.<br><br>&nbsp;  Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br>Shepherd response: <br>Bilhanan Silverajan, Pascal Thubert, and Rahul Jadhav have reviewed and<br>provided comments and the drafts were subsequently updated. The review<br>encompassed several rounds.&nbsp; Yong-Geun Hong and Houjianqiang (Derek) have<br>reviewed and found no issues.<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br>Shepherd response: Not Applicable<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Rahul Jadhav<br>Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>Shepherd response: <br>I have reviewed the document and my comments are addressed in version 07 that I<br>think is ready for IESG review.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>Shepherd response: No concerns<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>Shepherd response:<br>The document extends <a href="/doc/rfc7668/">RFC 7668</a> for using IPv6 mesh primitives based on BLE IPSP<br>profile. Mark Powell from Bluetooth SIG and an expert BLE (linux kernel)<br>implementor Alain Michaud had reviewed the document. The document may not need<br>a review from any other IETF directorate as part of the IESG processing.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>Shepherd response: No concerns<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>Shepherd response: All the authors have confirmed, no IPRs found.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>Shepherd response: Yes, all the authors have explicitly made a disclosure.<br>There are no IPRs on the draft as of now.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>Shepherd response: There have been 3 active comment providers and 2 other WG<br>participants (all from different backgrounds) who indicated that they have<br>reviewed the document and believe that it is ready for IESG submission. There<br>have been several voices indicating usefulness of the draft with no one voicing<br>any discontent.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>Shepherd response: No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

I found that the ref is included in the<br>normative section as it needs to be read/understood before the implementation<br>based on this draft could be handled.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs?

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br>Shepherd response: No IANA registries are updated by the document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br>Shepherd response: No IANA registries are updated.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>Shepherd response: Not applicable as there are no formal language constructs in<br>the document.<br></div></td>
