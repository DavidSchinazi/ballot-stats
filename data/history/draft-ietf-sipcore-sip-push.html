Although I find the solution<br>for SUBSCRIBE dialogs particularly unsatisifying, I'm not going to get<br>in the way of working group consensus here. The original discuss points<br>(and original comments) are detailed below.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks to everyone who is put work into defining this mechanism. I think it will<br>be very useful to have a solution for integrating push mechanisms into SIP<br>networks. I've identified three issues that I think need to be addressed in the<br>current document before it can move forward, and a fourth serious flaw that I<br>call out in my comments below.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>It's nice that this document has considered the impact of inbound mid-dialog<br>messages in long-lived dialogs. However, it appears to have a major hole in it:<br>handing of outbound messages for the purpose of maintaining soft-state in those<br>dialogs isn't handled correctly.<br><br>In particular: networks that deploy this mechanism will cause SUBSCRIBE<br>dialogs to time out and be destroyed while they are still in use.<br>Additionally, if <a href="/doc/rfc4028/">RFC 4028</a> (session timers) is negotiated, then INVITE dialogs<br>will suffer the same fate.<br><br>I can think of a couple of ways for these situations to be handled, but they<br>need explicit text in the document.<br><br>One approach would be to specify that the User Agent selects its requested<br>"Expires" value in its registration to be the smallest value before its set of<br>subscriptions and session timers needs to be refreshed. This would cause a push<br>notification to happen to prevent registration timeout, and the client could<br>refresh the other soft state at that time. Complications arise if the registrar<br>responds with a 483 (Interval too Brief), and we'd need to find a solution for<br>that.<br><br>Another approach would be for the clients to refresh all soft state whenever<br>they send a registration, and set the timeout for that soft state to be equal to<br>or greater than the registration timeout. A complication could arise if the<br>notifier or the peer in an invite dialog shortens the requested time, and we'd<br>need to find a solution for that.<br><br>A third approach would be getting the proxy involved in some way -- either by<br>requiring it to observe subscription and session timer timeouts and requiring it<br>to send push notifications prior to their expiration, or by an explicit<br>communication between the UA and the proxy that indicates when the next push<br>notification should be scheduled. If the latter approach is taken, I would<br>suggest that it needs to be taken for REGISTER messages as well.<br><br>I really don't think this mechanism is feasibly deployable without a solution to<br>this problem.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; For privacy and security reasons, the UA MUST NOT include the SIP URI<br>&gt;&nbsp; parameters defined in this document in non-REGISTER request, to<br>&gt;&nbsp; prevent the PNS information associated with the UA from reaching the<br>&gt;&nbsp; remote peer.<br><br>This seems to ignore the availability of Contact URI parameters via <a href="/doc/rfc3680/">RFC 3680</a><br>subscriptions. This would seem to impose a requirement on Registrars to strip<br>this information before making it available to any other party (which, in<br>turn, requires that the system have explicit Registrar *and* Proxy support).<br>As far as I can tell, the system so far has not required explicit proxy support<br>(and there's certainly no mechanism built-in that ensures that a proxy has any<br>special handling regarding this mechanism).<br><br>If the PNS information is sensitive, and cannot be allowed to leak out to<br>other users, then we need some way to ensure the registrar has provided<br>positive confirmation that it will not do so before allowing it to come into<br>possession of them.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; The UA can do so by only including the pn-provider<br>&gt;&nbsp; SIP URI parameter in the SIP Contact header field URI of the REGISTER<br>&gt;&nbsp; request, but without including the pn-prid SIP URI parameter.<br><br>Unless I'm mistaken, this is a barrier to interoperation.<br><br>It's not 100% clear, but I suspect the intended implication is that the<br>pn-provider parameter here will contain a single value? The syntax of the<br>parameter certainly seems to imply that. This seems to be a pretty big<br>problem, since it presupposes that the client will know which PNSes the Proxy<br>supports.&nbsp; Consider, for example, an iOS client that can use any of <a href="/doc/rfc8030/">RFC 8030</a>,<br>FCM, and APN (cf <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client">https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client</a>).<br>If the client doesn't know a priori what the proxy supports (and this entire<br>section only makes sense if that's true), then it won't know which of those<br>three services to indicate in its REGISTER request. If it guesses wrong, this<br>mechanism simply fails.<br><br>I think you need a different discovery mechanism here -- either have one that<br>has the client offering multiple PNS protocols and the proxy responding with<br>one, or have one in which the proxy indicates all of its supported services in<br>a response, and the client chooses one to use in its next REGISTER message.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Figure 1:<br><br>This diagram includes both a ladder diagram and an example REGISTER message.<br>While both of these are useful at this point in the document, neither of them is<br>an "Architecture," and they're really two different things. I suggest breaking<br>this into two Figures, entitled "Typical Information Flow" and "Example REGISTER<br>Message" (or similar), respectively.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; As long as the UA wants to receive push notifications (requested by<br>&gt;&nbsp; the proxy), the UA MUST include a pn-provider, pn-prid and a pn-param<br>&gt;&nbsp; (if required for the specific PNS provider) SIP URI parameter in each<br>&gt;&nbsp; binding-refresh REGISTER request.<br><br>Please be clear that these parameters appear in the Contact URI.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§5.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; In order to request push notifications towards a SIP UA that will<br>&gt;&nbsp; trigger the UA to send binding-refresh SIP REGISTER requests, the SIP<br>&gt;&nbsp; proxy needs to have information about when a registration will<br>&gt;&nbsp; expire.&nbsp; The proxy needs to be able to retrieve the information from<br>&gt;&nbsp; the registrar using some mechanism.&nbsp; Such mechanisms are outside the<br>&gt;&nbsp; scope of this document, but could be implemented e.g., using the<br>&gt;&nbsp; SIPregistration event package mechanism [<a href="/doc/rfc3680/">RFC3680</a>].<br><br>Nit: "SIP registration"<br><br>This mechanism seems to be predicated on an architecture in which the proxy must<br>be on the traffic path. Although it's problematic from a "what proxies are<br>expected to do" perspective, it seems like the proxy could glean this<br>information from the 200 response to the REGISTER request. (I mean, the proxy is<br>already reading parameters out of the contact header field, so the behavior of<br>acting on registration information is already assumed). The proxy would, of<br>course, need to run its own timers, but that seems to be a pretty minor<br>requirement, given everything else involved here.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§5.3.1:<br><br>This is a major comment, and one that has a sufficient impact on interop that I<br>had a long debate with myself about whether it should be a DISCUSS. Please take<br>it very seriously.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Otherwise, if the pn-provider SIP URI parameter identifies a type of<br>&gt;&nbsp; PNS that the proxy does not support, or if the REGISTER request does<br>&gt;&nbsp; not contain all additional information required for the specific type<br>&gt;&nbsp; of PNS, the proxy MUST either forward the request (e.g., if the proxy<br>&gt;&nbsp; knows that another proxy that will receive the REGISTER request<br>&gt;&nbsp; supports the type of PNS)...<br><br>How would the proxy know this?<br><br>Features like suppressing PNS behavior when a "sip.pns" feature capability is<br>present in the REGISTER imply that the various nodes in the network discover<br>capabilities of their neighbors automatically (which is consistent with the way<br>SIP does features), while this provision seems to require provisioned knowledge.<br>This is going to be operationally very confusing.<br><br>At the very least, the document needs to call out how this "knowledge" is<br>obtained. In the more general sense, since a client cannot rely on the proxy<br>supporting *any* kind of PNS, the use of 555 in the way specified here is at<br>best an optimization -- and, since the configured information can conflict with<br>actual reality, it's an optimization that can actually break things unless<br>extreme care is exercised. (e.g., if the proxy is configured to "know" that the<br>next proxy cannot provide push service, but this knowledge is wrong, then the<br>network is unnecessarily broken.)<br><br>My rather strong recommendation is to remove this code, and let the client rely<br>on the lack of indication of support in the response indicate that the feature<br>is not supported.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§5.3.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; o&nbsp; if the proxy received a 'sip.pnsreg' media feature tag in the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  REGISTER request, the proxy SHOULD include a 'sip.pnsreg' feature-<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  capability indicator with an indicator value bigger than 120 in<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  the response, unless the proxy always want to request push<br><br>Nit: "...wants..."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§5.3.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; If the contact of the REGISTER request does not match<br>&gt;&nbsp; the Request-URI of the SIP request to be forwarded, or if the contact<br>&gt;&nbsp; was not present in the REGISTER response, the proxy MUST reject the<br>&gt;&nbsp; SIP request with a 404 (Not Found) response.<br><br>This seems to be a very strong requirement ("MUST") when, e.g., many or most<br>networks may want to return a 480 instead of a 404.

In the more general sense, since a client cannot rely on the proxy<br>supporting *any* kind of PNS, the use of 555 in the way specified here is at<br>best an optimization -- and, since the configured information can conflict with<br>actual reality, it's an optimization that can actually break things unless<br>extreme care is exercised.

I reviewed a previous version, but since there have been substantial changes since that version, I treated this as a “from scratch” review.<br><br>This version is in much better shape than the previous. I think it’s almost ready for IETF LC, but I want to resolve at least the substantive comments first.<br><br>*** Substantive Comments ***<br><br>§1, paragraph 5: "Note that this mechanism necessarily adds delay to<br>responding to non-INVITE requests requiring push notification."<br><br>Technically, it adds delay for any transaction. Non-INVITE transactions are just more delay sensitive.<br><br>§3, <br>- first paragraph:<br>Please state this in terms of a scope assumption, not a global statement. That is, limit the scope of this document is limited to PNSs that work this way, rather than state that all PNSs work this way.<br><br>- 2nd paragraph: I think it's safe to say "The format of the PRID varies..." rather than "... may vary...".<br><br>§4.1<br><br>- General: When we speak of multiple bindings, and doing something to all of those bindings (e.g. refreshing them on a push-notification), is it allowable for a UA to have some bindings that use a PNS and some that do not? Or perhaps some that use different PNSs? I realize that may not make sense for the mobile device use case that seems centric to this draft, but I can imagine a situation where a complex UA might have different PNS configurations for different network paths and/or different SIP services.<br><br>If you want to assume that the PNS configuration is the same for all contacts, please say so explicitly. If not, does it make sense to scope PNS-triggered refreshes to just those bindings that use the same PNS configuration?<br><br>-2nd paragraph:<br>I don't think we can assume that all UAs will always learn all the bindings they need to to setup at the same time. For example, a UA might have changes in network configuration that require them to add or remove bindings. This makes it impractical to register them at the same time and always use the same expirations, unless we ask them to refresh all existing bindings whenever they add a new one. (Or perhaps ask them to set the expiration of any new binding to match the remaining time for existing ones, but that seems like a more difficult approach.)<br><br>-6th paragraph: "REGISTER request will create NAT bindings..."<br><br>If we talk about creating NAT bindings as one of the purposes of the push-triggered REGISTER, we may also need to think about the lifetime of those nat bindings, and how that interacts with the REGISTER expires value. I'm not sure we want to go there; would it make sense to remove the mention?<br><br>- 7th paragraph:<br>--&nbsp; The first sentence seems to still assume the REGISTER has as single contact. Should it say to insert the tag into each contact header field? (but see general §4.1 comment above.) <br><br>-- "if the response to the REGISTER request contains a ’sip.pnsreg’<br>feature-capability indicator with an indicator value, the UA MUST<br>send REGISTER requests prior to the registration expires."<br><br>This seems to duplicate a MUST from normal SIP. Would it make sense to just say "... the UA refreshes the binding according to normal SIP procedures".<br><br>§5.3.1:<br>- 4th paragraph: Section 4.1 talks about the UA paying attention to sip.pns in a 2XX response. It does not mention it for other result codes. If the UA needs to pay attention to it in 423 (or in any other response), it should be mentioned there.<br><br>-7th paragraph, "the proxy SHOULD insert a Feature-Caps header<br>field with a ’sip.pns’ feature-capability indicator": What if the response already contains it?<br><br>§5.3.2, 2nd paragraph: Please mention that the R-URI will only contain these parameters after it is retargeted. This mostly matters if the push-proxy is colocated with a retargeting proxy; retargeting must happen before this procedure.<br><br>Along those lines, what is the PUSH proxy expected to do with inbound SIP requests that do not contain the parameters in the R-URI? Route them normally? Reject them?<br><br>§6: Is support for push-notifications on mid-dialog requests optional? If so, please state that up front.<br><br>§6.1.1: Does the UA indicate support on a per-dialog basis? That is, it can support the mechanism for some dialogs but not others?<br><br>§8.1, 2nd paragraph: Should that say "only defined for ... responses", or "... and is not defined for use in request messages."?<br><br>§9, 1st paragraph: We are talking about a specification that defines the parameter usage for the given PNS, not the PNS in it's entirety, right?<br><br>§13, 3rd paragraph: The paragraph as written basically says "Operators must ensure SIP signaling is secured unless they are sure it's secured", which is circular logic. Would it make sense to say they must use TLS (or SIPS) unless they are sure that it is protected by other mechanisms?<br><br>§16.2: I think the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc3891/">RFC 3891</a> should be normative.<br><br><br>*** Editorial Comments ***<br><br>- All instances of "binding refresh REGISTER" should be "binding-refresh REGISTER". (This is true anywhere binding-refresh is used as an adjective.)<br><br>- There is still a lot of incorrect comma usage, especially commas where they don't belong. I will call out the ones I noticed.<br><br>- The phrases "request for a new dialog" and&nbsp; "standalone<br>SIP request" are used heavily and repeatedly, often in combination. The common terminology has historically been "dialog-initiating request" and "out-of-dialog request". These are, at least in combination, a bit shorter.<br><br>§1<br>- paragraph 5: Missing word in "awaken other means". I suggest "awakened by other means".<br>- Paragraph 6: "... SIP request for a new dialog, or a standalone<br>SIP request, addressed towards a UA...": Both commas should be removed.<br><br>- Figure 1: The "SIP 200 Okay" label is separated from the line it labels by a page break. (Other text changes may change the pagination, so this is probably one for the RFC editor if it's still an issue in the final version.)<br><br>§4.1, 7th paragraph ("Note"): The first sentence seems odd in the context of the previous paragraph, which talked extensively about UAs using non-push mechanisms.<br><br>§4.2, <br>- first paragraph:<br><br>-- first sentence: s/"network"/"SIP Network".<br>-- "... UA has received a response to the REGISTER request, with the<br>push notification information ...": improper comma.<br><br>- 3rd paragraph, "... early enough, in order for...": I suggest "... early enough for..."<br><br>§5.3.1<br>- 1st paragraph, "... towards the UA associated with the<br>REGISTER request, or perform any other procedures...": improper comma.<br><br>- 5th paragraph: <br>-- "... proxy that is not between the push proxy and the UA...". Doesn't this really mean a proxy that is between the push proxy and the registrar? If so, saying where the proxy _is_ would be clearer than saying where it is _not_.<br><br>-- "... (if the Contact header field URI of the REGISTER request<br>contains a pn-prid SIP URI parameter) ..." Could we have gotten this far if that were not true? The sentence would be easier to read without it. (I think this repeats a few times.)<br><br>- 6th paragraph: "MUST only" constructions can be ambiguous. It is better to state them in terms of "MUST NOT unless..."<br><br>- 2nd to last paragraph, "The proxy MUST be able..." It would be better to state this in terms of what the proxy _does_, not what it is _able_ to do. For example, "... MUST NOT ... unless it has determined that the PNS supports the VAPID mechanism."<br><br>§5.3.2<br>-&nbsp; 3rd paragraph: "This can happen if the<br>UA sends a binding refresh REGISTER request with a new contact...": This seems to ignore the potential of multiple contacts. I think the real condition is when the previous binding is _removed_.<br><br>-6th paragraph: I don't understand the meaning of this paragraph. (Also, both commas are incorrect.)<br><br>-11th paragraph: s/"losing race that results"/ "losing the race, which results"&nbsp; ; or "... a race..."<br><br>§6.2.3: Parts of this section seem specific to SIP-Events dialogs. I assume that's not the intent?</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be<br>&nbsp;  used to wake suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents<br>&nbsp;  (UAs), using push notifications, for the UA to be able to send<br>&nbsp;  binding refresh REGISTER requests and to receive receive incoming SIP<br>&nbsp;  requests.&nbsp; The document defines new SIP URI parameters and new<br>&nbsp;  feature-capability indicators that can be used in SIP messages to<br>&nbsp;  indicate support of the mechanism defined in this document, to<br>&nbsp;  exchange PNS information between the SIP User Agent (UA) and the SIP<br>&nbsp;  entity that will request push notifications towards the UA, and to<br>&nbsp;  trigger such push notification requests.<br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br>This document has had extensive discussion and review by a significant number of sip experts.&nbsp; The mechanism has been revised several times in response to substantive comments.&nbsp; There was controversy on the wisdom of providing mechanisms for proprietary push notification protocols to use, but the work group has a solid rough consensus that this document solves a real problem in an appropriate way and does not favor any proprietary push notification system over a standard one (<a href="/doc/rfc8030/">RFC8030</a>)<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br>There are many reports of implementations of proprietary solutions to the problem this document addresses, and discussion indicates this mechanism will replace those mechanisms in many cases.&nbsp; We expect quite a few implementations, but there have not been reports of actual implementations at this time.&nbsp; Many sipcore "regulars" have reviewed drafts of this document and made substantive comments which has resulted in many versions of the document. All comments have been addressed.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br>Brian Rosen is the Document Shepherd, Ben Campbell is the Area Director<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br>The shepherd has reviewed the current version of the document as well as several (but not all) of the many versions.&nbsp; The shepherd believes the document is ready for publication.<br> <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>There have been many detailed reviews of this document with many substantive comments, all of which have been addressed.&nbsp; Two WGLCs have been held because of the extend of changes made subsequent to the first WGLC.&nbsp; Commenters have been satisfied that their comments have been taken into account.&nbsp; One commenter is still unhappy with some of the mechanism but no other members have voiced support for his point of view.<br> <br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization?

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be<br>&nbsp;  used to wake suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents<br>&nbsp;  (UAs), using push notifications, for the UA to be able to send<br>&nbsp;  binding refresh REGISTER requests and to receive receive incoming SIP<br>&nbsp;  requests.&nbsp; The document defines new SIP URI parameters and new<br>&nbsp;  feature-capability indicators that can be used in SIP messages to<br>&nbsp;  indicate support of the mechanism defined in this document, to<br>&nbsp;  exchange PNS information between the SIP User Agent (UA) and the SIP<br>&nbsp;  entity that will request push notifications towards the UA, and to<br>&nbsp;  trigger such push notification requests.<br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br>This document has had extensive discussion and review by a significant number of sip experts.&nbsp; The mechanism has been revised several times in response to substantive comments.&nbsp; There was controversy on the wisdom of providing mechanisms for proprietary push notification protocols to use, but the work group has a solid rough consensus that this document solves a real problem in an appropriate way and does not favor any proprietary push notification system over a standard one (<a href="/doc/rfc8030/">RFC8030</a>)<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br>There are many reports of implementations of proprietary solutions to the problem this document addresses, and discussion indicates this mechanism will replace those mechanisms in many cases.&nbsp; We expect quite a few implementations, but there have not been reports of actual implementations at this time.&nbsp; Many sipcore "regulars" have reviewed drafts of this document and made substantive comments which has resulted in many versions of the document. All comments have been addressed.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br>Brian Rosen is the Document Shepherd, Ben Campbell is the Area Director<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br>The shepherd has reviewed the current version of the document as well as several (but not all) of the many versions.&nbsp; The shepherd believes the document is ready for publication.<br> <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>There have been many detailed reviews of this document with many substantive comments, all of which have been addressed.&nbsp; Two WGLCs have been held because of the extend of changes made subsequent to the first WGLC.&nbsp; Commenters have been satisfied that their comments have been taken into account.&nbsp; One commenter is still unhappy with some of the mechanism but no other members have voiced support for his point of view.<br> <br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br>No special reviews are needed. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br>No concerns<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br>No IPR disclosures have been filed.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br>The shepherd and chairs believe this document has decent consensus.&nbsp; There have been NO negative voices, not even a "do we have to do this?" negative.&nbsp; It is yet one more piece of ISUP that apparently needs a SIP transport to adequately handle calls originating from legacy systems.&nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br>No nits are present<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br>None needed<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br>None<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br>None<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br>This document will not change the status of any existing RFCs<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>). <br>This document has many simple IANA requests.&nbsp; Each is well documented and the shepherd is confident IANA will have no problems understanding what is needed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br>No expert reviewers are needed<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc. <br>The document contains a few lines of ABNF which have been reviewed.<br><br></div></td>

There are significant issues that I think need further attention from the working group before this can progress. I am returning the draft to the working group, and will change the state to “AD is Watching”.<br><br>Major Issues:<br><br>1. The mechanism makes SIP transactions pend for an indeterminate period of time while the push notification is processed, the recipient wakes up and sends a REGISTER request, and the registrar processes that request. This is a problem for non-INVITE transactions, and is not optimal for any transaction. (The issues with doing this to a non-INVITE transaction are best described in <a href="/doc/rfc4321/">RFC 4321</a>.)<br><br>At least for the non-INVITE case, has the working group considered a model where the transaction completes and the UAC resends it at some point in the future? (For example, a 4XX response with retry-after)<br><br>2. The architectural assumptions are unclear. In particular, the role of the proxy in the SIP network is unclear. In some parts of the draft, it appears the proxy must be co-located with the registrar, but others talk about a proxy that is on the path between the UA and the registrar. Along the same lines, the draft needs to clarify assumptions&nbsp; about proxy’s role for inbound SIP requests. (For example, the R-URI in an inbound request may or may not match the registered contact depending on whether the request has been retargeted—the R-URI could be an AoR rather than a registered contact.)<br><br>3. The mechanism seems to assume a single contact binding exists at any one time, and that any given REGISTER request relates to that binding. How is this expected to work if multiple bindings exist at the same time, perhaps with different expiration times? What if the user has multiple clients that are creating bindings, some supporting this mechanism and others not supporting it?<br><br><br>Other Substantive Comments:<br><br>§1<br>-&nbsp; Does this draft claim compatibility with APNS and FCM? Can you offer citations for those?<br><br>- " When the proxy receives (or, if the proxy is the SIP registrar[<a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC3261</a>], initiates) a SIP request for a new dialog”<br>I don’t understand the intent here; registrars do not normally initiate SIP requests for new dialogs.<br><br>“Different PNSs exist today.&nbsp; Some are based on the standardized mechanism defined in [ <a href="/doc/rfc8030/">RFC8030</a> ], while others are proprietary (e.g., the Apple Push Notification service).”<br><br>Is there an assumption that they are all similar enough that this mechanism can work with all of them? If so, please say that explicitly. <br><br>§2: Please use the new boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>.<br><br>§4.1: <br>- Please cite <a href="/doc/rfc6809/">RFC 6809</a> on the first mention of feature-caps. <br><br>- Please elaborate on the practical effect of supporting VAPID.<br><br>- " If the REGISTER response does not contain a a ’sip.pnsreg’ feature- capability indicator, the UA SHOULD only send a re-registration REGISTER request when it receives a push notification (even if the UA is able to use a non-push mechanism for sending re-registration REGISTER requests).”<br><br>Why? That’s normal SIP behavior for UAs that do not support this mechanism, so the registrar must be able to handle it. (If there’s a good reason, please explain it in the draft.)<br><br>- “ NOTE: If the SIP UA application wants to use push notifications for<br>&nbsp; other purposes than to trigger re-registration requests, it needs to<br>&nbsp; be able to distinguish between the different purposes when receiving<br>&nbsp; push notifications.&nbsp; Mechanisms for doing that are outside the scope<br>&nbsp; of this specification."<br><br>I can see keeping how you distinguish between SIP related notifications and other kinds of notifications. But what if the UA uses more than one SIP services that supports push notifications?<br><br>§5.2: “ It is RECOMMENDED that the proxy requests the push notification at least 120 seconds before the registration expires.” - We usually recommend refreshing bindings at when half of the expiration time has passed. Is there a reason to do this differently? If so, why 120 seconds in particular; has there been analysis of push notification latency?<br><br>§5.3.1:<br>-&nbsp; “ If the proxy considers the requested registration expiration interval<br>&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC3261</a>] to be too short, the proxy MUST either send a 423 (Interval<br>&nbsp; Too Brief) response to the REGISTER request, or skip the rest of the<br>&nbsp; procedures in this section and process the REGISTER request using<br>&nbsp; normal SIP procedures. "<br><br>That _is_ normal SIP procedure. What do you mean to be different?<br><br>- " if the proxy received a ’sip.pnsreg’ media feature tag in theREGISTER request, the proxy SHOULD include a ’sip.pnsreg’ feature-capability indicator with an indicator value bigger than 120 inthe response, unless the proxy always want to request push notifications to trigger the UA to send a REGISTER request.”<br><br>It’s not clear to me why the proxy should be able to override the UAs choice.<br><br>§5.3.2: <br>-"When the proxy receives (or, in case the proxy is the registrar, creates) a SIP request for a new dialog…”<br>Why would a registrar create a SIP request for a new dialog?<br><br>- “ If the contact of the most recent REGISTER<br>&nbsp; 2xx response and Request-URI do not match, the proxy MUST reject the<br>&nbsp; SIP request with a 404 (Not Found) response.&nbsp; This can happen if the<br>&nbsp; UA sends a re-registration REGISTER request with a new contact at the<br>&nbsp; same time the registrar forwards a SIP request towards a UA using the<br>&nbsp; previously registered contact in the Request-URI.”<br><br>Why doesn’t the proxy forward using normal SIP procedures? It’s entirely possible that an UAS address changes during an inbound transaction in normal SIP. Why is that different with push notifications? (this section seems to replace normal SIP request routing. That shouldn’t happen without a really good reason. If normal SIP procedures are inadequate, please explain why.<br><br>§6.2: Why does the UAC need to know the failure was due to push notification? What would it do differently than for other kinds of failures? (This seems like a privacy leak; does the recipient want the sender to know he or she is on a mobile <br>device?)<br><br>§11: “ If the push notification related information carried in SIP could be<br>&nbsp; used by a malicious middleman to trigger push notifications towards a<br>&nbsp; device, operators MUST ensure that the SIP signalling is properly<br>&nbsp; secured from malicious middlemen, e.g., using encryption.”<br><br>This could use some elaboration. I think the sense of this is backwards. That is, the signaling MUST be secured unless there are factors that make it impossible for an active attacker to use the informaiton.<br><br>§12.5: The template contains a “document” field, but the registration policy is “expert review”. Should this be “specification required”?<br><br><br>Editorial Comments:<br><br>- General: <br>— The draft has some readability issues. In particular, it pervasively uses long, convoluted sentences, lots of imbedded parenthetical phrases, improper comma placement, etc.<br>— The draft pervasively mixes registration procedures with the handling of inbound SIP requests. Please consider separating those into different sections. I realize there are interdependencies, but it’s hard to follow as is.<br><br>- Abstract: s/awake/wake ; (or awaken)&nbsp; (“awake” is not a verb. This repeats elsewhere in the draft. .)<br><br>§1,<br>- first paragraph: <br>-- Saying push notification is the only way to solve these issues seems overstated. It’s one way; there might be others.<br>-- when you talk about “each operating” system, you are talking about popular mobile operating system vendors, right? The assertion seems less true for operating systems in general.<br>- 4th paragraph: The usual term for re-registration is “binding refresh”.<br>-4th paragraph: “battery life etc”? What else?<br><br>- figure 1: The page break is unfortunate; can the ladder diagram be kept all on the same page?<br><br>§5.1, heading: Should “PNS Identifier” be “PNS Provider” (since that is what the section talks about.)<br><br>§5.2: <br>- “...the SIP proxy MUST have information” - the MUST seems like a statement of fact, not a normative requirements.<br>- “ If the proxy receives information that a registration has expired,…” - Bindings expire, not registrations. (Much of the draft uses the word “registration” when the common term is “binding"<br><br>§5.3, heading: s/Request/Requests<br><br>§5.3.1: “ If the proxy sends a SIP 555 (Push Notification Service Not Supported) response”<br>It would be helpful to describe 555 before this.<br><br>§5.3.2: “ The proxy MUST NOT include the SIP request as payload in the<br>&nbsp; requested push message.”<br>Wasn’t there already text forbidding payloads in general?<br><br>§6.7: "&nbsp; Parameter value chapters that are not part of pvalue needs to be escaped, as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC 3261</a>.”<br><br>What is a parameter value chapter? Should “chapters” be “characters”?<br><br>§7: This information belongs in the IANA considerations section.<br><br>§11: “ [<a href="/doc/rfc8292/">RFC8292</a>] defines a mechanism which allows a proxy to create a<br>&nbsp; identity itself to a PNS, by signing a JWT sent to the PNS using a<br>&nbsp; key pair."<br>I can’t parse the first clause.

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>&nbsp;  Proposed Standard, which is indicated in the header.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes how a Push Notification Service (PNS) can be<br>&nbsp;  used to awake suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents<br>&nbsp;  (UAs), using push notifications, for the UA to be able to send re-<br>&nbsp;  registration REGISTER requests and to receive receive incoming SIP<br>&nbsp;  requests.&nbsp; The document defines new SIP URI parameters and new<br>&nbsp;  feature-capability indicators that can be used in SIP messages to<br>&nbsp;  indicate support of the mechanism defined in this document, to<br>&nbsp;  exchange PNS information between the SIP User Agent (UA) and the SIP<br>&nbsp;  entity that will request push notifications towards the UA, and to<br>&nbsp;  trigger such push notification requests.<br> <br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document solves an existing problem of waking up a client when <br>&nbsp;  the underlying platform only supports some form of push notification.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  Typically, this issue arises in a smart phone app, or similar battery <br>&nbsp;  operated device, where the platform only supports a push notification <br>&nbsp;  mechanism for wake-up.&nbsp; Several proprietary implementations have <br>&nbsp;  been noted, and the work group desired a standardized mechanism <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp;  This short document received detailed review from a several&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  of working group participants. The authors incorporated received<br>&nbsp;  feedback. One commenter wanted an open standard push mechanism, <br>&nbsp;  despite the actual problem being primarily proprietary push.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  The authors attempted to satisfy the lone commenter but<br>&nbsp;  did not totally satisfy his request.<br><br>&nbsp;  The mechanism is quite simple and several implementations are<br>&nbsp;  planned.<br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Brian Rosen is the document shepherd. Ben Campbell is the <br>&nbsp; responsible area director. <br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The shepherd thoroughly reviewed the last versions of the draft.<br>&nbsp; The document is ready to be forwarded to the IESG.&nbsp; <br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document requires no specialized expertise beyond that <br>&nbsp;  possessed by regular participants in the SIPCORE working group.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No concerns. <br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author has confirmed conformance with BCPs 78 and 79.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  No disclosure has been filed.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp;  There was a great deal of discussion on this relatively simple draft.<br>&nbsp;  All comments were resolved to the commenter’s satisfaction except one.<br>&nbsp;  Martin Thomson is still not satisfied.&nbsp; He raised a series of comments,<br>&nbsp;  most of which were dealt with satisfactorily.&nbsp; He had one remaining<br>&nbsp;  comment on the text that deals with getting text notifications when<br>&nbsp;  the UA is able to maintain registrations.&nbsp; He did not propose a change<br>&nbsp;  and was slow in responding to the author.&nbsp; The chairs judge that we <br>&nbsp;  have rough consensus to move the document forward now.&nbsp; <br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br> <br>&nbsp;  idnits 2.14.01 was run, the only nits noted are XXXX references<br>&nbsp;  to the documents eventual RFC number in IANA actions.<br>&nbsp;  The Shepherd checked the draft against <br>&nbsp;  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist.html">http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist.html</a>.<br>&nbsp;  No issues were found with the draft.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No formal review requirements are triggered by this document, <br>&nbsp;  aside from any required by IANA process.<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The IANA Considerations section adds new SIP URI parameters.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  registry is clearly and correctly identified and the new parameters<br>&nbsp;  are completely and correctly defined.&nbsp;  It adds two SIP Response<br>&nbsp;  codes.&nbsp; The registry is clearly and correctly identified, and the<br>&nbsp;  new response codes are completely and correctly defined.&nbsp; It adds<br>&nbsp;  new feature-capability indicators.&nbsp; The registry is clearly and<br>&nbsp;  correctly identified and the new indicators are completely and<br>&nbsp;  correctly defined.&nbsp; Finally, the document defines a new sub-<br>&nbsp;  Registry in sip-parameters.&nbsp; The registry definition has a complete<br>&nbsp;  Description of initial values, the management mechanism is<br>&nbsp;  appropriate and well specified, and the registry has a reasonable<br>&nbsp;  name.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document adds a new sub registry in sip-parameters, <br>&nbsp;  Pn-provider, which requires Expert Review for future allocations.<br>&nbsp;  The registry lists push providers, so the expert should be generally<br>&nbsp;  aware of operating systems and environments for battery operated <br>&nbsp;  sip devices that may provide push services to be used by this<br>&nbsp;  mechanism. <br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  The shepherd carefully checked the ABNF, which makes extensive<br>&nbsp;  use of productions found in <a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC3261</a> and other RFCs and would be<br>&nbsp;  hard to check with available tools.&nbsp; <br></div></td>
