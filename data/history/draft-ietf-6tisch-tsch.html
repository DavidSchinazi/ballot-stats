I don't <br>suppose there is anything to be done about that now, but you used a lot<br>of words!<br><br>---<br><br>There are a number of abbreviations that the RFC Editor will ask you to <br>expand on first use both in the Abstract and in the main body of text.<br>If you have te document open for other edits, you should take a pass at<br>this to make sure the right expansions are used.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1, para 3<br>Not sure whether "ultra-lower power" is a typo or an undefined term.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Bringing industrial-like performance into the LLN stack...<br><br>I'm not sure what "industrial-like performance" is supposed to mean.<br>Two paragraphs earlier you described the industrial environment, but not<br>anything that matches the term "industrial-like performance".<br><br>Could you usefully reword as "Enabling the LLN protocol stack to operate<br>in industrial environments..."<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  What is missing is a Logical<br>&nbsp;  Link Control (LLC) layer between the IP abstraction of a link and the<br>&nbsp;  TSCH MAC, which is in charge of scheduling a timeslot for a given&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  packet coming down the stack from the upper layer.<br><br>I found this odd. Do you mean to say...<br><br>&nbsp;  What is missing is a link layer control protocol that is in charge of<br>&nbsp;  scheduling a timeslot for a given IP packet that will be encapsulated <br>&nbsp;  in the TSCH MAC.<br><br>But in Section 4 I see you have come back to the term "LLC". I'm not <br>comfortable with this use of the term. It doesn't fit (as far as I can<br>see) with the conventional (i.e., OSI) usage of the term. You might look<br>to GMPLS for the way that this terminology issue was handled for <br>adaptation into layer 2 or 1 technologies, and the way that those<br>technologies are controlled by signaling or management protocols.<br><br>---<br><br>It would seem that Section 2 is redundant and can be removed.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  Low-power WPANs are characterized<br>&nbsp;  by small packet sizes<br><br>Is this the characterisation that you want to call to our attention or<br>is it the small maximum frame size?<br><br>---<br><br>The last paragraph of Section 3 seems to be out of place. It is <br>certainly worth noting any implementation information, but, as <br>recommended by <a href="/doc/rfc6982/">RFC 6982</a> this information is better placed either in an<br>implementation report (a separate document) or in a wiki.
