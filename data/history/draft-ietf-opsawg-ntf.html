However, packet contents are not the only things that<br>can be a threat to user privacy, and we've seen numerous instances where<br>just metadata about user flows are sufficient to make strong conclusions<br>about user behavior that impact user privacy.&nbsp; But if we try to<br>strengthen the requirement to be not collecting any data about user<br>packets, the utility of the system decreases greatly, and I don't see a<br>clear way to reconcile the impasse.<br><br>(There are also a few lingering references to "user flows", "user<br>packets", "user traffic", etc. in the main body text, especially in<br>§2.3.&nbsp; I'm not convinced that all of the instanaces of these phrases are<br>compatible with the applicability statement.)<br><br>Furthermore, the applicability statement seems to be a case of wishful<br>thinking.&nbsp; I do not see any proposals for technical measures to enforce<br>that data is not collected from networks where endpoints represent<br>users, and I also don't see any mechansisms to disincentivize such use<br>in favor of other, more privacy-friendly, alternatives.&nbsp; So even if we<br>consider such usage of the network telemetry framework to be an abuse<br>case rather than a use case, if we are going to honestly document the<br>implications of the technology, I can't escape the conclusion that we<br>need to consider these scenarios in our assessment of whether we are<br>defining the right technology.<br><br><br>Though I am balloting Abstain, I will also some specific comments on the<br>document that might help improve it, even if I may not be completely<br>happy with the resulting document (for the reasons described above).<br><br>It's pretty surprising to see a document that mentions autonomic<br>networking and aims to achieve self-managing networks make no reference<br>at all to the IETF ANIMA WG or its outputs, a group that is specifically<br>chartered to produce protocols and procedures for automated network<br>management.&nbsp; In particular, it's my understanding that ANMIA has had<br>very little traction with network Intent thus far, and this document<br>references IRTF documents in many places (both for Intent and other<br>things).&nbsp; Are we confident that these concepts are ready to move from<br>the IRTF into the engineering world?<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Network visibility is the ability of management tools to see the<br>&nbsp;

 forward.&nbsp; When a network's endpoints do not represent individual<br>&nbsp;  users (e.g. in industrial, datacenter, and infrastructure contexts),<br>&nbsp;  network operations can often benefit from large-scale data collection<br>&nbsp;  without breaching user privacy.<br><br>In the vein of my toplevel remarks, I don't think that just "a network's<br>endpoints do not represent individual users" is sufficient to ensure<br>that large-scale data collection does not breach user privacy.&nbsp; It<br>covers first-order effects, I think, but we've seen a lot of research<br>indicating that second- and higher-order analyses can still extract<br>information that reduces user privacy.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To preserve the privacy of end-users, no user packet content should<br>&nbsp;  be collected.&nbsp; Specifically, the data objects generated, exported,<br>&nbsp;  and collected by a network telemetry application should not include<br>&nbsp;  any packet payload from traffic associated with end-users systems.<br><br>Also in the vein of my toplevel remarks, while "do not include user<br>traffic payload" is a minimum requirement, and I'm happy to see it<br>stated clearly, it in and of itself is not sufficient to fully protect<br>end-user privacy.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; visibility into networks.&nbsp; The ultimate goal is to achieve the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; security with no, or only minimal, human intervention.<br><br>It's easy to achieve security without human intervention, if you're<br>willing to accept a high false positive rate and denial of legitimate<br>traffic.&nbsp; Should we say something about tempering the security goal with<br>a need for not disrupting legitimate traffic flows?<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conventional OAM only covers a narrow range of data (e.g., SNMP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only handles data from the Management Information Base (MIB)).<br><br>This argument feels a bit weak given that anyone with an OID arc (that<br>is, just about anyone) can add to the MIB.<br><br>Section 2.4<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; customized in network at run-time to cater to the specific need of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applications.&nbsp; This needs the support of a programmable data plane<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which allows probes with custom functions to be deployed at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flexible locations.<br><br>I'm having a hard time seeing how data that's customized in-network at<br>runtime would be compatible with being modeled in advance.&nbsp; Maybe the<br>disclaimer about "not expected to be held by every specific technique"<br>is intended to apply here, but it might be worth acknowledging the<br>tradeoff.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; In-band Data Collection: In addition to the passive and active<br>&nbsp;

I need to more carefully review the responses to the comments.&nbsp; Where resolution could be quickly assessed from the diff, I have already updated my ballot accordingly.&nbsp; -12 may in fact address more of the comments still noted below.)<br><br>(Ballot on -11):<br>I'm a bit of confusion on the framing of this document.&nbsp; It seems to me to be suggesting that “OAM” is a tied to a series of static technologies and practices, and a set of new practices called “network telemetry” are needed.&nbsp; I don’t disagree with the idea that network management practices need to evolve, and that the “networks of the future” will look different than today.&nbsp; Relying on <a href="/doc/bcp161/">BCP 161</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc6291/">RFC 6291</a>), I took OAM to mean an evolving set of practices and technology.&nbsp; Using Section 3 of <a href="/doc/bcp161/">BCP 161</a>, O + A + M seemed like a contextual set of operations that would be done now and still required in networks of the future.&nbsp; The document acknowledges that there is some ambiguity in “network telemetry”.&nbsp; I think it needs to equally acknowledge that the same is true of OAM, and that <a href="/doc/rfc7276/">RFC7276</a> is not OAM.&nbsp; In the aggregate, I don’t think the text realizes the clarity that it set out to provide by defining “key characteristics of network telemetry which set a clear distinction from the conventional network OAM and show that some conventional OAM technologies can be considered a subset of the network telemetry technologies.”.&nbsp; To be clear, I’m not raising an objection to many of the properties linked to network telemetry.&nbsp; Instead, I think the clarity of message is getting diluted because a very particular distinction is trying to be made (OAM vs. network telemetry) and it isn’t clear.&nbsp; See below for a specifics.<br><br>** Section 1<br>&nbsp;  Network telemetry extends beyond the historical network Operations,<br>&nbsp;  Administration, and Management (OAM) techniques and expects to<br>&nbsp;  support better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and<br>&nbsp;  performance.<br><br>This seems hypothetical depending on the definition on which technologies are considered in scope of network telemetry and OAM.<br><br>** Section 2.<br><br>Today one can access advanced big data analytics capability through a<br>&nbsp;  plethora of commercial and open source platforms (e.g., Apache<br>&nbsp;  Hadoop), tools (e.g., Apache Spark), and techniques (e.g., machine<br>&nbsp;  learning).&nbsp; Thanks to the advance of computing and storage<br>&nbsp;  technologies, network big data analytics gives network operators an<br>&nbsp;  opportunity to gain network insights and move towards network<br>&nbsp;  autonomy.&nbsp; <br>In trying to contextual this observation, where is this capability relative to Figure 1?&nbsp; In general, I would recommend that this reference architecture when assessing the ecosystem. <br><br>** Section 2.<br><br>However, while the data processing capability is improved and<br>&nbsp;  applications are hungry for more data ...<br><br>What does it mean and what applications are “hungry for more data”.&nbsp; Is a reference possible here?<br><br>** Section 2.3<br>&nbsp;  For a long time, network operators have relied upon SNMP [<a href="/doc/rfc3416/">RFC3416</a>],<br>&nbsp;  Command-Line Interface (CLI), or Syslog to monitor the network.&nbsp; Some<br>&nbsp;  other OAM techniques as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc7276/">RFC7276</a>] are also used to<br>&nbsp;  facilitate network troubleshooting.<br>...<br>&nbsp;  These challenges were addressed by newer standards and techniques<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., IPFIX/Netflow, PSAMP, IOAM, and YANG-Push) and more are<br>&nbsp;  emerging.&nbsp; These standards and techniques need to be recognized and<br>&nbsp;  accommodated in a new framework.<br><br>This section is an exemplar of the disconnect I noted in the definitions of OAM.&nbsp; The first paragraph presents a narrow view of currently used (albeit older) network monitoring technologies (SNMP, CLI Syslog).&nbsp; However, in the closing paragraph, the text names more modern technologies I would also consider OAM, and these technologies could meet some of the challenges mentioned in this section.&nbsp; Furthermore, some of these “newer standards” are framed as things that need to be “recognized”.&nbsp; This is puzzling because my understanding was that technologies like IPFIX/Netflow have been very widely deployed for quite some time now.&nbsp; What’s the new framework needed?<br><br>** Section 2.4<br>Network telemetry covers the conventional network OAM and<br>&nbsp;  has a wider scope.&nbsp; <br><br>Can the text be more specific in what way network telemetry is wider.&nbsp; I thought OAM was rather ambiguous.<br><br>** Section 2.4<br>Hence, the network telemetry can directly<br>&nbsp;  trigger the automated network operation, while in contrast some<br>&nbsp;  conventional OAM tools are designed and used to help human operators<br>&nbsp;  to monitor and diagnose the networks and guide manual network<br>&nbsp;  operations.<br><br>I’m not sure if this is a fair generalization.&nbsp; Even “older technologies” like SNMP currently trigger automated responses based on the values they return.<br><br>** Section 2.4.&nbsp; Per “data fusion,” which part of the Figure 1 is this happening?<br><br>** Section 2.5.<br><br>Network data analytics and machine-learning technologies are applied<br>&nbsp;  for network operation automation, relying on abundant and coherent<br>&nbsp;  data from networks.&nbsp; <br><br>What is coherent data?<br><br>** Section 2.5<br>All the use cases and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applications are better to be supported uniformly and coherently<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; under a single intelligent agent<br><br>-- Editorial.&nbsp; There is a missing word which leads to this sentence not parsing.<br><br>-- What’s the basis for asserting that a “single intelligent agent” is the&nbsp; best approach?<br><br>-- Maybe the issue is of semantics, what is an “intelligent agent” in this context?<br><br>** Section 2.5.&nbsp; <br><br>Network visibility presents multiple viewpoints<br><br>and<br><br>Efficient data fusion is critical for applications to reduce the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; overall quantity of data and improve the accuracy of analysis.<br><br>Are these generalizations expected to be true across the broad use cases?<br><br>** Figure 2.&nbsp; For the management plane, the data model module has MIB and syslog listed, but the data encodings as GPB, JSON and XML.&nbsp; These data models and encodings don’t line up (i.e., MIBs and syslog typically don’t rely on GPB, JSON or XML).&nbsp; <br><br>** Section 3.1.&nbsp; Where do network security applications such as WAFs, IDS/IPS/ NGF, DLP, web-proxies, and pDNS fit into this taxonomy?<br><br>** Section 3.1.* These sections inconsistently describe properties/requirements for an architectural element and their challenges (but no solutions or requirements for) a given elements.&nbsp; As a result, I had trouble understanding what an implementer should understand these components.&nbsp; It would have been clearer is the different modules had common and module specific requirements.<br><br>** Section 3.1.1.&nbsp; Per the requirements of “Convenient Data Subscription”, “Structured Data”, etc. why wouldn’t those be desirable requirements for all four of the modules?<br><br>** Section 3.1.3.&nbsp; Providing “timely data” and “structured data”, seem like the restatements of Section 4.1.1’s “structure data” and “high speed transport”.&nbsp;

I conducted most of my review on -10 and then -11 was published which renumbered the document)<br><br>Thanks to Alexey Melnikov for the SECDIR review.<br><br>I'm a bit of confusion on the framing of this document.&nbsp; It seems to me to be suggesting that “OAM” is a tied to a series of static technologies and practices, and a set of new practices called “network telemetry” are needed.&nbsp; I don’t disagree with the idea that network management practices need to evolve, and that the “networks of the future” will look different than today.&nbsp; Relying on <a href="/doc/bcp161/">BCP 161</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc6291/">RFC 6291</a>), I took OAM to mean an evolving set of practices and technology.&nbsp; Using Section 3 of <a href="/doc/bcp161/">BCP 161</a>, O + A + M seemed like a contextual set of operations that would be done now and still required in networks of the future.&nbsp; The document acknowledges that there is some ambiguity in “network telemetry”.&nbsp; I think it needs to equally acknowledge that the same is true of OAM, and that <a href="/doc/rfc7276/">RFC7276</a> is not OAM.&nbsp; In the aggregate, I don’t think the text realizes the clarity that it set out to provide by defining “key characteristics of network telemetry which set a clear distinction from the conventional network OAM and show that some conventional OAM technologies can be considered a subset of the network telemetry technologies.”.&nbsp; To be clear, I’m not raising an objection to many of the properties linked to network telemetry.&nbsp; Instead, I think the clarity of message is getting diluted because a very particular distinction is trying to be made (OAM vs. network telemetry) and it isn’t clear.&nbsp; See below for a specifics.<br><br>** Section 1.<br>… using a wide variety of techniques including machine learning, data analysis, and correlation.<br><br>ML, data analysis and correlation are unlike things.&nbsp; ML is a particular AI technique, data analysis is a generic description of an activity, and is correlation intended to be a statistical technique?<br><br>** Section 1<br>&nbsp;  Network telemetry extends beyond the historical network Operations,<br>&nbsp;  Administration, and Management (OAM) techniques and expects to<br>&nbsp;  support better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and<br>&nbsp;  performance.<br><br>This seems hypothetical depending on the definition on which technologies are considered in scope of network telemetry and OAM.<br><br>** Section 2.<br><br>Today one can access advanced big data analytics capability through a<br>&nbsp;  plethora of commercial and open source platforms (e.g., Apache<br>&nbsp;  Hadoop), tools (e.g., Apache Spark), and techniques (e.g., machine<br>&nbsp;  learning).&nbsp; Thanks to the advance of computing and storage<br>&nbsp;  technologies, network big data analytics gives network operators an<br>&nbsp;  opportunity to gain network insights and move towards network<br>&nbsp;  autonomy.&nbsp; <br>In trying to contextual this observation, where is this capability relative to Figure 1?&nbsp; In general, I would recommend that this reference architecture when assessing the ecosystem. <br><br>** Section 2.<br><br>However, while the data processing capability is improved and<br>&nbsp;  applications are hungry for more data ...<br><br>What does it mean and what applications are “hungry for more data”.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; ideal security with no, or only minimal, human intervention.<br><br>What is “ideal” security?<br><br>** Section 2.2. <br>While machine learning technologies can be used for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; root cause analysis, it up to the network to sense and provide the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relevant diagnostic data which are either actively fed into, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passively retrieved by, machine learning applications.<br><br>This text is asymmetric with the others bullets since don’t discuss specific techniques.&nbsp;  Personally, it also seem odd to include this text as there are other ways&nbsp; to do root cause analysis beyond ML (to include other AI approaches).<br><br>** Section 2.3<br>&nbsp;  For a long time, network operators have relied upon SNMP [<a href="/doc/rfc3416/">RFC3416</a>],<br>&nbsp;  Command-Line Interface (CLI), or Syslog to monitor the network.&nbsp; Some<br>&nbsp;  other OAM techniques as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc7276/">RFC7276</a>] are also used to<br>&nbsp;  facilitate network troubleshooting.<br>...<br>&nbsp;  These challenges were addressed by newer standards and techniques<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., IPFIX/Netflow, PSAMP, IOAM, and YANG-Push) and more are<br>&nbsp;  emerging.&nbsp; These standards and techniques need to be recognized and<br>&nbsp;  accommodated in a new framework.<br><br>This section is an exemplar of the disconnect I noted in the definitions of OAM.&nbsp; The first paragraph presents a narrow view of currently used (albeit older) network monitoring technologies (SNMP, CLI Syslog).&nbsp; However, in the closing paragraph, the text names more modern technologies I would also consider OAM, and these technologies could meet some of the challenges mentioned in this section.&nbsp; Furthermore, some of these “newer standards” are framed as things that need to be “recognized”.&nbsp; This is puzzling because my understanding was that technologies like IPFIX/Netflow have been very widely deployed for quite some time now.&nbsp; What’s the new framework needed?<br><br>** Section 2.4<br>Network telemetry covers the conventional network OAM and<br>&nbsp;  has a wider scope.&nbsp; <br><br>Can the text be more specific in what way network telemetry is wider.&nbsp; I thought OAM was rather ambiguous.<br><br>** Section 2.4<br>Hence, the network telemetry can directly<br>&nbsp;  trigger the automated network operation, while in contrast some<br>&nbsp;  conventional OAM tools are designed and used to help human operators<br>&nbsp;  to monitor and diagnose the networks and guide manual network<br>&nbsp;  operations.<br><br>I’m not sure if this is a fair generalization.&nbsp; Even “older technologies” like SNMP currently trigger automated responses based on the values they return.<br><br>** Section 2.4.&nbsp; Per “data fusion,” which part of the Figure 1 is this happening?<br><br>** Section 2.5.<br><br>Network data analytics and machine-learning technologies are applied<br>&nbsp;  for network operation automation, relying on abundant and coherent<br>&nbsp;

 development for the following reasons:<br><br>It might be helpful to level set what an application is in this context.&nbsp; Is this the “network operations application” of Figure 1?<br><br>** Section 2.5<br>All the use cases and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applications are better to be supported uniformly and coherently<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; under a single intelligent agent<br><br>-- Editorial.&nbsp; There is a missing word which leads to this sentence not parsing.<br><br>-- What’s the basis for asserting that a “single intelligent agent” is the&nbsp;
