 IOAM is expected to be deployed in a specific domain.&nbsp; The part of<br>&nbsp;  the network which employs IOAM is referred to as the "IOAM-Domain".<br><br>In light of the (new) text up in §5, we might consider rewording this<br>part as well, mostly to avoid mentioning "network" that risks confusion<br>about "network domain" (pre previous discussion).<br><br>&nbsp;  An "IOAM transit node" read and/or write and/or process one or more<br>&nbsp;  of the IOAM-Data-Fields.&nbsp; If both the Pre-allocated and the<br>&nbsp;  Incremental Trace Option-Types are present in the packet, each IOAM<br>&nbsp;  transit node based on configuration and available implementation of<br>&nbsp;  IOAM populates IOAM trace data in either Pre-allocated or Incremental<br>&nbsp;  Trace Option-Type but not both.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Since we redefined transit nodes to include only reading, in addition to<br>modifying, it doesn't seem 100% accurate to say that "each transit node<br>populates [one or the other but not both]" -- it seems valid for a<br>transit node to populate zero of the trace option types.<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  An IOAM-Namespace can be associated to a subset or all of the the<br>&nbsp;  IOAM-Option-Types and their corresponding IOAM-Data-Fields.&nbsp; IOAM-<br><br>This sentence seems confusing to me.&nbsp; It talks about namespaces as if<br>they contain options, but if we go on to examine the actual data<br>structures each option has a field to indicate the associated namespace.<br>We even go on to say that the IOAM-Namespace field "MUST be included in<br>all future IOAM-Option-Types" (side note: might be worth calling that<br>out in the guidance in the IANA considerations, and also to specifically<br>say that it's the first field of the option).&nbsp; So it's really not clear<br>to me what this sentence is adding -- would it be safe to just remove<br>it?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; IOAM-Namespaces can be used by an operator to distinguish<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; different operational domains.&nbsp; Devices at domain edges can filter<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on Namespace-IDs to provide for proper IOAM-Domain isolation.<br><br>I suggest tweaking the wording to clarify that the "different<br>operational domains" in the first sentence are precisely the<br>"IOAM-Domain"s of the second sentence.<br><br>&nbsp;

I don't object to<br>leaving this discusison in place but it may be prudent to think about<br>paring down what we say here.&nbsp; In particular, there seems to be some<br>(admittely, small) chance that the SFC doc will not have exactly two POT<br>types.<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>It seems that in going from the -12 to -15 we lost the paragraph about<br>leap seconds here.&nbsp; My understanding is that posix timestamps *are*<br>affected by leap seconds, and so it is correct to include such a<br>statement.&nbsp; My ballot comment on the -12 was conditioned on the use of<br>TAI for the epoch, and thus my comment on the -12 is irrelevant.<br><br>Section 10<br><br>We should probably say that the opaque snapshot, namespace specific<br>data, etc., will have security considerations corresponding to their<br>defined data contents that should be described where those formats are<br>defined. [ed. this remains unchanged from my comment on the -12; I'm not<br>sure if the intent to add some text just got overlooked, but don't<br>intend to rehash any discussions that were already made.]<br><br>Since we clarified the definition of transit nodes to include read-only<br>transit nodes, we might want to say something about how transit nodes<br>that only implement support for one or the other trace option types (as<br>is clearly permitted) will have an incomplete picture of the trace in<br>cases where both trace option types are used for the same packet.&nbsp; In<br>many cases that is innocuous, of course, but it does not seem guaranteed<br>to always be so.<br><br>&nbsp;  allowing attackers to collect information about network paths,<br>&nbsp;  performance, queue states, buffer occupancy and other information.<br><br>One possible application of such reconiassance is to gauge the<br>effectiveness of an ongoing attack (e.g., if buffers and queues are<br>overflowing).&nbsp; I don't know whether it's particularly useful to mention<br>that scenario here or not, though, and the lack of response the previous<br>time I made the comment suggests that it's not actually useful to<br>mention it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, in order to limit the scope of threats<br>&nbsp;  mentioned above to within the current network domain the network<br>&nbsp;  operator is expected to enforce policies that prevent IOAM traffic<br>&nbsp;  from leaking outside of the IOAM domain, and prevent IOAM data from<br>&nbsp;  outside the domain to be processed and used within the domain.<br><br>On the -12, I said "it would be great if we could provide a bit more<br>detail on the scope of consequences if the operator fails to do so."<br>Some of the follow-up discussion suggested that<br><a href="/doc/draft-brockners-opsawg-ioam-deployment/">draft-brockners-opsawg-ioam-deployment</a> would be a better home, which I<br>don't object to; I'm retaining this comment just in case there was<br>actual desire to put such content in this document.&nbsp; No specific reply<br>is expected or required, either way.<br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; controllers.&nbsp; For example, the node identifier field (node_id, see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; below) does not need to be unique in a deployment (e.g., if an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operator wishes to use different node identifiers for different<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM layers, even within the same device; or node identifiers<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; might not be unique for other organizational reasons, such as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after a merger of two formerly separated organizations), the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Namespace-ID can be used as a context identifier, such that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; combination of node_id and Namespace-ID will always be unique.<br><br>This looks like a comma splice (maybe put a sentence break after the<br>long parenthetical?).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Assigning different IOAM Namespace-IDs to different sets of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nodes or network partitions and using the Namespace-ID as a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  selector at the IOAM encapsulating node, a full trace for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  flow could be collected and constructed via partial traces in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  different packets of the same flow.&nbsp; Example: An operator could<br><br>I think s/Assigning/By assigning/ (note the comment that indicates<br>there are "two copies" of this text).<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Time of day when the packet was processed by the node as well as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the transit delay.&nbsp; Different definitions of processing time are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feasible and expected, though it is important that all devices of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an in-situ OAM domain follow the same definition.<br><br>I think we've been standardizing on the "IOAM domain" spelling.</div></td>

It does<br>not quite rise to a Discuss because it is technically possible to<br>implement successfully if done perfectly, but it seems incredibly risky<br>and very hard to get right, and there does not seem to be sufficient<br>motivation presented for the benefits of this behavior to justify the<br>risk.&nbsp; Specifically, by partitioning all IOAM behaviors by<br>IOAM-Namespace, we require a node to know whether or not it is to behave<br>as ingress/egress for a domain on a per-namespace basis.&nbsp; In effect, it<br>allows for a proliferation of as many distinct and partially overlapping<br>IOAM Domains as there are namespace values, and whether a node is<br>ingress (or egress) for any given domain has to be looked up on the<br>basis of the specific IOAM-Namespace value.&nbsp; I find this concerning<br>because the security properties of the system rely on properly policing<br>the domain boundary, so that IOAM markings from outside the domain are<br>rejected at ingress, and IOAM data is not leaked out of the domain by<br>policing at egress.&nbsp; While we have ample evidence to suggest that it is<br>feasible to maintain a single tightly controlled domain that properly<br>polices ingress and egress (e.g., MPLS), I don't know of evidence to<br>suggest that it is feasible to do so with a spate of partially<br>overlapping domains where domains and domain membership are malleable<br>based the interaction of configuration and in-band protocol elements.<br>It seems incredibly likely that some domain boundary somewhere will be<br>inadvertently permeable, and compromise the security properties of the<br>system.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>(side note) There's perhaps something of a philosophical question of<br>whether a mechanism really qualifies as "in situ" if it involves<br>encapsulating the packet in a full-fledged tunnel (as at least the IPv6<br>encapsulation does, as is needed to add the additional EHs that hold<br>IOAM data fields).&nbsp; That said, I don't really have any alternative<br>suggestions, and I am sure that IOAM is a well-established terminology,<br>so this is just a side node.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  Scope: This document defines the data fields and associated data<br>&nbsp;  types for in-situ OAM.&nbsp; The in-situ OAM data field can be<br>&nbsp;  encapsulated in a variety of protocols, including NSH, Segment<br>&nbsp;  Routing, Geneve, IPv6, or IPv4.&nbsp; Specification details for these<br><br>I found drafts (split between targeting ippm and "the relevant working<br>groups") that would cover Geneve and IPv6, but not anything for IPv4.<br>Are we fully confident that the aim is actually achievable for IPv4?<br><br>&nbsp;  Deployment domain (or scope) of in-situ OAM deployment: IOAM is a<br>&nbsp;  network domain focused feature, with "network domain" being a set of<br>&nbsp;  network devices or entities within a single administration.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  example, a network domain can include an enterprise campus using<br>&nbsp;  physical connections between devices or an overlay network using<br>&nbsp;  virtual connections / tunnels for connectivity between said devices.<br><br>If these virtual connections/tunnels do not provide cryptographic<br>confidentiality and integrity protection, then the security<br>considerations for IOAM need to include the full physical deployment<br>scope including the underaly over which the overlay is constructed, not<br>just the "administrative domain" as defined here.<br><br>Furthermore, there seems to be a very questionable interaction between<br>labeling the IOAM deployment domain an administrative domain yet<br>allowing for multiple partially overlapping IOAM domains as<br>distinguished by namespace ID.&nbsp; Does the administrative domain have to<br>encompass the union of all the different IOAM domains (as identified by<br>namespace ID)?<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  An "IOAM transit node" updates one or more of the IOAM-Data-Fields.<br><br>(per the discuss)<br>The previous discussion suggested that even a node that only reads<br>IOAM-DataFields is still considered a "transit node", and that updating<br>the field contents is not necessary in order to justify that moniker.<br>That said, the notion that a transit node is writing (e.g., to update<br>trace option-types) seems to be prevailing throughout later portions of<br>the document, so perhaps it is the text a few paragraphs earlier that is<br>in error.<br><br>&nbsp;  If both the Pre-allocated and the Incremental Trace Option-Types are<br>&nbsp;  present in the packet, each IOAM transit node based on configuration<br>&nbsp;  and available implementation of IOAM populates IOAM trace data in<br>&nbsp;  either Pre-allocated or Incremental Trace Option-Type but not both.<br><br>(per the discuss)<br>Likewise, is this "populates" mandatory?<br><br>&nbsp;  A transit node MUST ignore IOAM-Option-Types that it does not<br>&nbsp;  understand.&nbsp; A transit node MUST NOT add new IOAM-Option-Types to a<br>&nbsp;  packet, MUST NOT remove IOAM-Option-Types from a packet, and MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  change the IOAM-Data-Fields of an IOAM Edge-to-Edge Option-Type.<br><br>Almost all of this (not the Edge-to-Edge stuff) seems fairly<br>tautological, in that if a node did that stuff it would be an<br>encapsulating and/or decapsulating node, possibly in addition to being a<br>transit node.<br><br>&nbsp;  The role of an IOAM-encapsulating, IOAM-transit or IOAM-decapsulating<br>&nbsp;  node is always performed within a specific IOAM-Namespace.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  means that an IOAM node which is e.g. an IOAM-decapsulating node for<br>&nbsp;  IOAM-Namespace "A" but not for IOAM-Namespace "B" will only remove<br>&nbsp;  the IOAM-Option-Types for IOAM-Namespace "A" from the packet.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp;  that this applies even for IOAM-Option-Types that the node does not<br>&nbsp;  understand, for example an IOAM-Option-Type other than the four<br>&nbsp;  described above, that is added in a future revision.&nbsp; An IOAM<br>&nbsp;  decapsulating node situated at the edge of an IOAM domain MUST remove<br>&nbsp;  all IOAM-Option-Types and associated encapsulation headers for all<br>&nbsp;  IOAM-Namespaces from the packet.<br><br>I can only make sense of this paragraph as a whole if the last sentence<br>instead says "MUST remove from the packet [...] for all IOAM-Namespaces<br>for which the node is a decapsulating node.&nbsp; The current text says to<br>remove literally all IOAM information for literally all IOAM-Namespaces,<br>which seems to contradict the separation of namespaces depicted earlier<br>in the paragraph.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A particular implementation of IOAM MAY choose to support only one of<br>&nbsp;  the two trace option types.&nbsp; In the event that both options are<br>&nbsp;  utilized at the same time, the Incremental Trace-Option MUST be<br>&nbsp;  placed before the Pre-allocated Trace-Option.&nbsp; Deployments which mix<br>&nbsp;  devices with either the Incremental Trace-Option or the Pre-allocated<br>&nbsp;  Trace-Option could result in both Option-Types being present in a<br>&nbsp;  packet.&nbsp; Given that the operator knows which equipment is deployed in<br>&nbsp;  a particular IOAM, the operator will decide by means of configuration<br>&nbsp;  which type(s) of trace options will be used for a particular domain.<br><br>Up in Section 5.2 we said that "each IOAM transit node based on<br>configuration and available implementation" populates exactly one trace<br>option type.&nbsp; I think I can read the two statements as being consistent<br>with each other, but it might be useful to harmonize the specific<br>language used to make it very clear that these refer to the same<br>behavior.<br><br>Section 5.4.1<br><br>Just to check my understanding: when I first read the discussion of this<br>being an "array" and there being a potential "Opaque State Snapshot"<br>component, I assumed that the length of this opaque snapshot would need<br>to be fixed per array element (i.e., as part of the namespace<br>definition).&nbsp; Having read a bit more, it seems that my initial<br>assumption is incorrect, since there is a length field in the opaque<br>state snapshot framing, and so a node parsing the array of elements will<br>be able to skip over the approprate (variable) length for each element<br>in the array.&nbsp; Please confirm that my updated understanding is correct.<br><br>&nbsp;  Namespace-ID:&nbsp; 16-bit identifier of an IOAM-Namespace.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Namespace-ID value of 0x0000 is defined as the "Default-Namespace-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ID" (see Section 5.3) and MUST be known to all the nodes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implementing IOAM.&nbsp; For any other Namespace-ID value that does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; match any Namespace-ID the node is configured to operate on, the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node MUST NOT change the contents of the IOAM-Data-Fields.<br><br>Though it may seem banal to do so, explicitly listing "change, add, or<br>remove" might help avoid future questions of how to interpret this text.<br>E.g., there is some similar text in <a href="/doc/rfc2460/">RFC 2460</a> about "examined or<br>processed" that proved to be highly controversial and was changed in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC<br>8200</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A node receiving an IOAM Pre-allocated or Incremental Trace-Option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relies on the NodeLen value, or it can ignore the NodeLen value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and calculate the node length from the IOAM-Trace-Type bits (see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; below).<br><br>Allowing an implementation to pick one or the other option like this<br>introduces fragility to the system as a whole and requires strict<br>controls that encapsulating nodes always set the value even if their<br>implementation does not use it.&nbsp; I would prefer if we had a single<br>well-specified required behavior for all nodes, that could be easily<br>tested for conformance.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit 0&nbsp; "Overflow" (O-bit) (most significant bit).&nbsp; If there are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  not enough octets left to record node data, the network element<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MUST NOT add any fields and MUST set the overflow "O-bit" to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "1" in the IOAM-Trace-Option header.&nbsp; This is useful for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  transit nodes to ignore further processing of the option.<br><br>This makes things awkward for a lot of the earlier statements that<br>require transit nodes to populate trace data.&nbsp; How is the document<br>internally consistent in this regard, if transit nodes are both required<br>to populate trace data and required to not add trace data?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NodeLen - sizeof(opaque snapshot) in 4 octet units.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RemainingLen in a pre-allocated trace option exceeds the length of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the option, as specified in the preceding header, then the node<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST NOT add any fields.<br><br>What is the "preceding header"?&nbsp; This seems like perhaps it originated<br>in a description of a concrete protocol encoding of this data item and<br>does not quite apply to the abstract description thereof.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit 12-21&nbsp; Undefined.&nbsp; An IOAM encapsulating node MUST set the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  value of each of these bits to 0.&nbsp; If an IOAM transit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  node receives a packet with one or more of these bits set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to 1, it MUST either:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Add corresponding node data filled with the reserved<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  value 0xFFFFFFFF, after the node data fields for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  IOAM-Trace-Type bits defined above, such that the<br><br>Just to confirm: this means that there cannot be any future allocations<br>of bits to "wide format" items and thus that only bits 8-10 will ever<br>consume 2 units each of four-octets?&nbsp; (This does not preclude allocating<br>two adjacent bits to indicate a single logical data item, of course,<br>with appropriate error handling for when only one of the two is set.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bit 23&nbsp;  Reserved: MUST be set to zero upon transmission and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ignored upon receipt.<br><br>I note that this description for the "reserved" bit has a different<br>specified behavior than the unallocated bits 12-21 (that require a node<br>to fill the data with ones if the bit is set).&nbsp; Do we have a sense for<br>any ways in which this reserved bit's semantics could be used for future<br>extensibility, vs being locked into these (basically useless) semantics<br>forever?<br><br>Section 5.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Some IOAM-Data-Fields defined below, such as interface identifiers or<br>&nbsp;  IOAM-Namespace specific data, are defined in both "short format" as<br>&nbsp;  well as "wide format".&nbsp; Their use is not exclusive.&nbsp; A deployment<br>&nbsp;  could choose to leverage both.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>While the text goes on to clarify that, based on per-domain<br>configuration, they can hold qualitatively different types of<br>information, I still must ask if there is any entity that is or might be<br>tasked with enforcing that there is consistency between the two fields<br>(mostly for when they are different representations of the same<br>information, but not necessarily exclusively so).<br><br>Section 5.4.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Hop_Lim:&nbsp; 1-octet unsigned integer.&nbsp; It is set to the Hop Limit value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the packet at the node that records this data.&nbsp; Hop Limit<br><br>"In the packet" at ingress to, or egress from, the node?<br><br>&nbsp;  node_id:&nbsp; 3-octet unsigned integer.&nbsp; Node identifier field to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uniquely identify a node within the IOAM-Namespace and associated<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM-Domain.&nbsp; The procedure to allocate, manage and map the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node_ids is beyond the scope of this document.<br><br>Even if we attempt to leave allocation/management of node_ids out of<br>scope for this document, I think we still need to talk about what goes<br>wrong and how to recover in case of collision.<br><br>Section 5.4.2.2<br><br>I kind of expected some note that the interpretation of the interface<br>identifier fields here is (or might be?) going to be specified by the<br>node they apply to and can only be interpreted in that context.&nbsp; Or are<br>these expected to be allocated by a central entity?<br><br>Section 5.4.2.12<br><br>&nbsp;  The "buffer occupancy" field is a 4-octet unsigned integer field.<br>&nbsp;  This field indicates the current status of the occupancy of the<br>&nbsp;  common buffer pool used by a set of queues.&nbsp; The units of this field<br>&nbsp;  are implementation specific.&nbsp; Hence, the units are interpreted within<br>&nbsp;  the context of an IOAM-Namespace and/or node-id if used.&nbsp; The authors<br>&nbsp;  acknowledge that in some operational cases there is a need for the<br>&nbsp;  units to be consistent across a packet path through the network,<br>&nbsp;  hence it is RECOMMENDED for implementations to use standard units<br>&nbsp;  such as Bytes.<br><br>I guess I'm not sure that I understand exactly what this field should be<br>indicating, even if my implementation does adhere to the recommendation<br>to "use standard units such as Bytes" (which, by the way, could probably<br>stand to be a stronger recommendation for a single distinguished unit<br>chosen by the authors).&nbsp; That is, if I suppose that the node in question<br>has some common pool of buffers that's shared across queues.&nbsp; Maybe all<br>the buffers are the same size, maybe not.&nbsp; But in order to measure<br>"occupancy", is it more important to know how many bytes are occupied,<br>how many buffers are in use, or what proportion of the total buffers are<br>in use?&nbsp; Just knowing the number of bytes or buffers in use does not<br>convey much information if the total capacity is unknown, and having 40<br>MB of buffers in use would mean something very different for a CPE<br>router vs "big iron".&nbsp; Can we give a bit more clarity into at least what<br>portions of the semantics need to be set at a per-namespace level, even<br>if we can't nail them down more tightly as part of the protocol spec?<br><br>Section 5.4.13<br><br>&nbsp;  Schema ID:&nbsp; 3-octet unsigned integer identifying the schema of Opaque<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data.<br><br>Just to check my understanding: the interpretation of this schema ID is<br>per IOAM-Namespace, which is mostly going to be something maintained by<br>the individual operators.&nbsp; So in some sense each operator will have to<br>maintain and publish (internally) a registry of these Schema IDs and<br>avoid collisions.&nbsp; Is this the sort of thing that is already a common<br>practice, or is there a risk of operational fragility being introduced?<br><br>Furthermore, some of the Namespace IDs are not operator-managed, e.g.,<br>0x0000.&nbsp; Is the opaque state snapshot functionality just not going to be<br>used for those well-known namespaces?&nbsp; If so, we should say so<br>explicitly.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Random: Unique identifier for the packet (e.g., 64-bits allow for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the unique identification of 2^64 packets).<br><br>We should probably say that this is generated using a<br>cryptographic-strength PRNG (i.e., not rand()).&nbsp; <a href="/doc/bcp106/">BCP 106</a> covers<br>randomness requirements for security.<br><br>Also, due to the birthday paradox, an actual 64-bit random identifier will<br>produce collisions well before 2^64 packets.&nbsp; Since these identifiers<br>(AFAICT) need to be assigned in an uncoordinated fashion, the random<br>allocation scheme may well be the best scheme (or "least bad"), but if<br>that's the case I don't think we should make bold statements like "allow<br>for the unique identification of 2^64 packets".<br><br>&nbsp;  IOAM POT flags:&nbsp; 8-bit.&nbsp; Following flags are defined:<br><br>It's slightly surprising to me that the flags are defined as having<br>global semantics across all POT values, as opposed to being interpreted<br>in the context of the POT type they are used with, but that's not<br>inherently problematic.<br><br>Section 5.5.1<br><br>Should we just say that the Namespace-ID, POT Type, and flags are as<br>defined in Section 5 rather than repeating the definitions wholesale<br>(or, as we currently do, having to modify the definition text slightly)?<br>In particular (but not exclusively), it's pretty distracting to have<br>Section 5 refer to "Bit 0" and "Bit 1-7" but Section 5.5.1 refer to the<br>"P bit" and "R (7 bits)"<br><br>&nbsp;  P bit:&nbsp; 1-bit.&nbsp; "Profile-to-use" (P-bit) (most significant bit).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indicates which POT-profile is used to generate the Cumulative.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any node participating in POT will have a maximum of 2 profiles<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; configured that drive the computation of cumulative.&nbsp; The two<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; profiles are numbered 0, 1.&nbsp; This bit conveys whether profile 0 or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; profile 1 is used to compute the Cumulative.<br><br>Is it worth saying a few more words about how the P bit is used as a<br>"generation count" for performing incremental/in-place updates of what<br>profile to use, and that profile 0 can be repurposed for something new<br>once all uses of its previous interpretation have been removed from the<br>network?&nbsp; ("No" is a fine answer, but it might be worth proactively<br>allaying the concern that you can only have two profiles, ever.)<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>I suggest giving some guidance as to whether the initial sequence number<br>should (not) start at zero, for the fields indicated by bits 0 and 1.<br>I note that <a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> has some<br>discussion supporting starting at non-zero values.&nbsp;

This<br> <br>It seems a little awkward that an operator is going to have to base<br>their processing logic on knowledge of what *implementation* the<br>encapsulating node is, especially on a heterogeneous network.&nbsp;

When node data is added, the node MUST decrease RemainingLen by the amount of data added."<br><br>This text includes a normative inconsistency.&nbsp; If the sender doesn't initialize the "value of RemainingLen according to the number of node data bytes allowed" (because it is optional!), and the transit node does "decrease RemainingLen by the amount of data added" (because it is required), then the value won't reflect the data space remaining and a downstream node may add enough bits to overflow -- or not add anything because it considered the overflow imminent.<br><br><br>(9) §5.4.1: "If RemainingLen in a pre-allocated trace option exceeds the length of the option, as specified in the preceding header, then the node MUST NOT add any fields."&nbsp;  I didn't find "the length of the option" defined anywhere.&nbsp; Did I miss it?<br><br><br>(10) §5.4.1: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bit 12-21&nbsp; Undefined.&nbsp; An IOAM encapsulating node MUST set the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  value of each of these bits to 0.&nbsp; If an IOAM transit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  node receives a packet with one or more of these bits set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to 1, it MUST either:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Add corresponding node data filled with the reserved<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  value 0xFFFFFFFF, after the node data fields for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  IOAM-Trace-Type bits defined above, such that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  total node data added by this node in units of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  4-octets is equal to NodeLen, or<br><br>This first option assumes that all undefined data fields will be 4-octets long.&nbsp; But if future data fields are defined to be 8-octets (and the transit node doesn't understand them) then 0xFFFFFFFF won't be enough and there will be a misalignment.&nbsp; IOW, I don't think it is possible to require this behavior -- unless it is also required that all future data fields have to be 4-octets long.<br><br><br>(11) Some of the values to be included in the data fields (§5.4.*) are not well defined and could result in nodes reporting inconsistent measurements.&nbsp; Specifically, transit delay and queue depth.&nbsp; It would be ideal if the document provided some guidance for the implementation/use.<br><br><br>(12) §8.7: "Upon a new allocation request, the responsible AD will appoint a designated expert, who will review the allocation request."&nbsp;  This sentence is not needed: the assignment happens only once and not when whenever "a new allocation request" comes up.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This memo describes a specific type of OAM capability intended to operate within a network domain, and complements traditional measurement tools for connectivity and route discovery (such as ping and traceroute). This form is called In-situ-OAM, and the techniques employed fall in the <a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC 7799</a> category of Hybrid Type I (as a combination of Active measurement using synthetic traffic and pure Passive observations of user traffic, by adding measurement-specific information to user traffic).&nbsp; Packets with In-situ OAM encapsulation record information as they traverse nodes within a specific network domain. This information includes timestamps, identification of interfaces, and other details that can assist with OAM activities which include new ones, such as proof of transit (exactly which nodes/interfaces were visited). The IOAM encapsulation will be added/removed at domain ingress/egress, may be added to all or a subset of packets, and updated at all or a subset of transit nodes. IOAM Namespaces provide another dimension of flexibility for actions. This memo will be used a as a reference for additional RFCs that specify encapsulations in a variety of protocols, such as Segment Routing, Geneve, or IPv6.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>This work topic &amp; proposal was bounced-around a bit before finding an appropriate home in Transport Area and IPPM WG.<br><br>Many of the details of IOAM data fields and operations were discussed at length on e-mail and debated at side meetings.

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Al Morton<br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?&nbsp; Martin Duke<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Shepherd has reviewed the present draft, and several previous version dating back to the original proposals. Some of the reviews were prompted by interaction between IOAM capabilities and the IPPM WG Draft on Route Metrics. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns, the review in total has been extensive, with many detailed items precipitating active discussions. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The usual Directorate Reviews should be sufficient.<br>OPS should ensure that Shepherd's comments appended to this form have been resolved.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns. There has been plenty of time for concerns to be expressed and for consensus to emerge (since July 2016).<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Consensus in the end appears strong, after considerable review and negotiation.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No Appeals threatened.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>No problems with nits, several comments on version 09 to check:<br><br>&nbsp; == Unused Reference: 'I-D.lapukhov-dataplane-probe' is defined on line<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  1815, but no explicit reference was found in the text<br><br>&nbsp; -- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref.

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>All Normative References are complete/approved.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Possibly - see item (11) above.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No change of status for other docs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>This memo creates a new family of registries, and the initial contents have been carefully provided.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This memo describes a specific type of OAM capability intended to operate within a network domain, and complements traditional measurement tools for connectivity and route discovery (such as ping and traceroute). This form is called In-situ-OAM, and the techniques employed fall in the <a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC 7799</a> category of Hybrid Type I (as a combination of Active measurement using synthetic traffic and pure Passive observations of user traffic, by adding measurement-specific information to user traffic).&nbsp; Packets with In-situ OAM encapsulation record information as they traverse nodes within a specific network domain. This information includes timestamps, identification of interfaces, and other details that can assist with OAM activities which include new ones, such as proof of transit (exactly which nodes/interfaces were visited). The IOAM encapsulation will be added/removed at domain ingress/egress, may be added to all or a subset of packets, and updated at all or a subset of transit nodes. IOAM Namespaces provide another dimension of flexibility for actions. This memo will be used a as a reference for additional RFCs that specify encapsulations in a variety of protocols, such as Segment Routing, Geneve, or IPv6.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>This work topic &amp; proposal was bounced-around a bit before finding an appropriate home in Transport Area and IPPM WG.<br><br>Many of the details of IOAM data fields and operations were discussed at length on e-mail and debated at side meetings.

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Al Morton<br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?&nbsp; Martin Duke<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Shepherd has reviewed the present draft, and several previous version dating back to the original proposals. Some of the reviews were prompted by interaction between IOAM capabilities and the IPPM WG Draft on Route Metrics. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns, the review in total has been extensive, with many detailed items precipitating active discussions. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The usual Directorate Reviews should be sufficient.<br>OPS should ensure that Shepherd's comments appended to this form have been resolved.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Consensus in the end appears strong, after considerable review and negotiation.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No Appeals threatened.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Possibly - see item (11) above.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No change of status for other docs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>This memo creates a new family of registries, and the initial contents have been carefully provided.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.
