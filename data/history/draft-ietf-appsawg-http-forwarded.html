With this document, we're standardising<br>something that is the opposite of privacy-friendly, basically just<br>because the existing X-Forwarded-* header fields exist and are used<br>already and anything we developed that was more privacy-friendly<br>wouldn't get deployed. <br><br>I'm also not at all clear as to who benefits from standardising<br>this, e.g. see my comments on 7.2 &amp; 8.1 below. That may have been<br>discussed on the apps-discuss list, but I don't recall that so am<br>concerned that we may just be standardising this because someone had<br>the energy to write and process the document.<br><br>I think the document would be better if it didn't present this as<br>being a good (or unconditionally "needed") thing, at least without<br>caveats. For example, I don't think this is "needed" by users, but<br>rather more by others. That's mostly a writing-style thing though.<br><br>What is a "trusted path" of proxies, or a "trusted proxy"? I think<br>that phrase could just be deleted since there are very few cases<br>where anyone knows of and (equally) trusts all the proxies on a<br>path. I don't think the document defines that well enough for the<br>phrase to be kept.<br><br>Encouraging addition and modification of header fields like this<br>means that any future HTTP e2e integrity mechanisms will have to be<br>more complex than otherwise, basically about as complex as DKIM (or<br>the DOSETA proposal derived from that). I'm not sure if that might<br>or might not have a bad effect on future work with HTTP. I don't<br>know if that was discussed on the httpbis list or on apps-discuss.<br><br>Section 4 says proxies MUST ensure the "correct" header field is<br>updated but doesn't seem to say exactly how to know which header<br>field is the correct one.<br><br>5.4 seems to be standardising a practice that amounts to trying to<br>fool the user-agent into believing that TLS was used end to end when<br>in fact it was not. While this is so widely deployed that its<br>probably pointless to try even discourage, I'm not convinced that a<br>WG would design a standard for a server-side crypto accellerator in<br>this way. I think we'd be more likely to make the middlebox at least<br>visible to the user-agent.<br><br>7.2 doesn't seem to me to specify when to preserve the header field<br>and when not to do so. I don't think "direct consequence" is<br>something that all implementers will understand in the same way.<br>(If doing whatever you like is fine here, then that calls into<br>question the basis for standardising this in the first place.)<br><br>8.1 says this cannot be relied upon. If that's the case then why is<br>it being standardised? Whitelisting proxies is (as the document<br>admits) not a credible mitigation.<br><br>8.2 says telling the client about the proxy chain is somehow a bad<br>thing but doesn't justify that. Since a client could find out anyway<br>if they wanted to bother, that seems wrong. <br><br>8.2 says to disallow the TRACE request. Is that a change to HTTP?<br>If so, then where was that discussed?<br><br>Section 9 says only that the expert should ensure that the<br>specification "address the security and privacy implications of the<br>requested parameter." So if I defined a parameter that passed on the<br>precise location of the end-user or the most recent healthcare<br>related URL they've accessed then would that be ok? I think<br>additional instructions are needed as to the acceptable purposes to<br>which such parameters can be put or else perhaps IETF review would<br>in fact be better. Given the field of applicability I would not be<br>surprised if very privacy-invasive parameters were defined in<br>future.</div></td>

While RFC Required forces new registrations through the IETF RFC<br>process, and might discourage registrations from individuals or<br>organizations that are unfamiliar with or averse to that process,<br>Specification Required necessitates the appointment of a Designated<br>Expert to review the requests and associated specifications.&nbsp; Each of<br>these policies comes with baggage, and we have to make sure we're<br>weighing it down with the *right* baggage.<br><br>2. If we stay with Specification Required we should include a short<br>paragraph with rough guidelines for the Designated Expert: what to<br>consider when approving registration requests.&nbsp; If we want the DE to<br>approve most requests, just checking the associated specifications for<br>sanity, we need to say that.&nbsp; If we want the DE to put some judgment<br>into deciding whether the requested parameters make sense and fit into<br>the usage model, or whatever, we should say something about that. <br>Comments and proposed text for this are encouraged.<br>====================================<br></div></td>
