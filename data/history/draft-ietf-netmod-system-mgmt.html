Should be something like MUST support SSH, MAY support others, not “password over any transport” as currently. Plaintext transport should be explicitly prohibited, or if not prohibited, at least strongly recommended against, and it should be in the body of the document, not buried in the security considerations.<br><br>5) 5 – MD5 is deprecated and a new YANG module should not support it and should instead support TCP-AO. I don’t see the point in having it here, and then burying a “not recommended” in the end of the security considerations. <br><br>General:<br>Odd that TACACS is not discussed at all as an alternative to RADIUS or DIAMETER.<br><br>You rightly raise the concern about the level of access to the system this model proposes (ability to reload/shutdown, etc). I think this doc is making the implicit assumption that the AAA method being used will also include some level of role definition that controls which commands are usable and which are prohibited by user/client, including the potential for different roles for different systematic uses of this interface — different IDs with different authentication. This is obliquely discussed in the security considerations, but it would be very useful to make this assumption more explicit in the body of the document so that people are thinking in that way when implementing support for the different AAA models. It may even be worth explicitly defining a set of commands which must be separately authenticated before they are executed so that there’s a method for “are you sure?” before triggering reloads and the like.<br><br>As to which Hashes and algorithms, I agree that SHA256 seems sort of puny but aren’t there much better documents discussing which algorithms and key lengths are appropriate that this document could refer to? <br>For something like an RFC, it makes sense to define the most secure algorithm as mandatory to implement, while allowing enough extensibility to support others, whether they are newer/better or lesser due to hardware/scale limitations.&nbsp; This probably means SHA-512 with salt, but I defer to folks with a better background in security.</div></td>

The time elements of this module support NTP.&nbsp; Was there any consideration to also support alternative methods of setting the system clock like IEEE 1588?<br><br>2. The crypt-hash typedef has a small table in the description clause that lists three hash algorithms and there are corresponding feature statements for each of those algorithms.&nbsp; Was there any thought given to how a new algorithm could be added without having to update this module?&nbsp; The feature statements for these algorithms only contain a description clause, so there doesn't appear to be any algorithm-specific things needed in this module.&nbsp; The reason I noticed this is that I have several Linux distros that support Blowfish in their crypt() functionality.&nbsp; Is it possible to maintain the set of supported algorithms in a registry?</div></td>
