The operative issue being that for the purposes of connection termination they are hosts not routers and they have to find the upper layer header (and potentially go as far as application protocol implementation).<br><br>...<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all cases, the layer 3/4 load balancer has to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recognize incoming packets as belonging to new or existing client<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sessions, and choose the target server or proxy so as to ensure<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; persistence.<br><br>I get what you're trying to say but I think this is a a mis-statement. As you go on to deal with stateless load balancing correctly... A stateless L3+L4 load balancer doesn't care whether a connection is new or preexisting, persistence is product of the values associated with the hash being immutable over the duration for which they are required and no other condition.<br><br>...<br><br>1.&nbsp; Balancers use various techniques to redirect traffic to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specific target server.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - All servers are configured with the same IP address, they<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are all on the same LAN, and the load balancer sends directly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to their individual MAC addresses.&nbsp; In this case, return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets from the server to the client are sent back without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passing through the balancer, a technique known as direct<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server return, but we are not concerned here with the return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer uses an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP-in-IP tunnel to reach it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performs NAPT (network address and port translation) to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deliver the client's packets to that address.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The choice between these methods is not affected by use of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flow label.<br><br>You missed one that is rather common which is that there are multiple L3 next-hops&nbsp; for the same destination IP (Layer-3 ECMP the same as is used to hash across router links). that's anycast in it's simplest form, and it's a pretty common technique using either bgp or an IGP of your choice.<br><br>...<br><br>jjaeggli@ca2-b2-re1# run show route 2620:102:8003:211::1/128<br><br>inet6.0: 14896 destinations, 59622 routes (14896 active, 0 holddown, 29172 hidden)<br>+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both<br><br>2620:102:8003:211::1/128<br>&nbsp;

The other question is how do you know when the session ends. since you're not looking for fin/ack/fin/ack or RST your basically stuck keeping state with a timer or this state table will always be full.<br><br>This is not as the security considerations section states:<br><br>&nbsp; The flow label does not significantly alter this situation.<br><br>with regard to dos/bypass risk. Rather techniques used today by stateful l3/l4 load balancers to mitigate dos risk statelessly to protect servers from large packet flows e.g. TCP syn cookies or apply gross security controls e.g. only port 80 connections for example) become ineffective because the attacker generating valid connections can know in advance what source/dest/flow label(s) will be used by to create connections through which packets can be delivered to servers (which is a rather different problem then it being hard to guess what someone else is using). <br>...<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the<br>&nbsp;  only state to be stored is the 2-tuple and the server identifier,<br>&nbsp;  storage requirements will be reduced. <br><br>and a timer apparently, either the 2 minute one from 3697 if we consider that still in force since 6437 doesn't mention it, or some other one. <br>...<br><br>&nbsp; The association between the flow label value and<br>&nbsp;  the server is stored in a table (often called stick table) so that<br>&nbsp;  future connections using the same flow label can be sent to the same<br>&nbsp;  server.<br><br>This presumes the reuse of flow labels by a client. while 6437 presumes the existence of stateful flow label usage models, state entries that&nbsp; last a long time relative to the tcp connections that use them are an expensive proposition for a network device.</div></td>

Balancers use various techniques to redirect traffic to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specific target server.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - All servers are configured with the same IP address, they<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are all on the same LAN, and the load balancer sends directly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to their individual MAC addresses.&nbsp; In this case, return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets from the server to the client are sent back without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passing through the balancer, a technique known as direct<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server return, but we are not concerned here with the return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer uses an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP-in-IP tunnel to reach it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performs NAPT (network address and port translation) to<br>&nbsp;

The other question is how do you know when the session ends. since you're not looking for fin/ack/fin/ack or RST your basically stuck keeping state with a timer or this state table will always be full.<br><br>This is not as the security considerations section states:<br><br>&nbsp; The flow label does not significantly alter this situation.<br><br>with regard to dos/bypass risk. Rather techniques used today by stateful l3/l4 load balancers to mitigate dos risk statelessly to protect servers from large packet flows e.g. TCP syn cookies or apply gross security controls e.g. only port 80 connections for example) become ineffective because the attacker generating valid connections can know in advance what source/dest/flow label(s) will be used by to create connections through which packets can be delivered to servers (which is a rather different problem then it being hard to guess what someone else is using). <br>...<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the<br>&nbsp;  only state to be stored is the 2-tuple and the server identifier,<br>&nbsp;  storage requirements will be reduced. <br><br>and a timer apparently, either the 2 minute one from 3697 if we consider that still in force since 6437 doesn't mention it, or some other one. <br>...<br><br>&nbsp; The association between the flow label value and<br>&nbsp;  the server is stored in a table (often called stick table) so that<br>&nbsp;  future connections using the same flow label can be sent to the same<br>&nbsp;  server.<br><br>This presumes the reuse of flow labels by a client. while 6437 presumes the existence of stateful flow label usage models, state entries that&nbsp; last a long time relative to the tcp connections that use them are an expensive proposition for a network device.</div></td>

The operative issue being that for the purposes of connection termination they are hosts not routers and they have to find the upper layer header (and potentially go as far as application protocol implementation).<br><br>...<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all cases, the layer 3/4 load balancer has to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recognize incoming packets as belonging to new or existing client<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sessions, and choose the target server or proxy so as to ensure<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; persistence.<br><br>I get what you're trying to say but I think this is a a mis-statement. As you go on to deal with stateless load balancing correctly... A stateless L3+L4 load balancer doesn't care whether a connection is new or preexisting, persistence is product of the values associated with the hash being immutable over the duration for which they are required and no other condition.<br><br>...<br><br>1.&nbsp; Balancers use various techniques to redirect traffic to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specific target server.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - All servers are configured with the same IP address, they<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are all on the same LAN, and the load balancer sends directly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to their individual MAC addresses.&nbsp; In this case, return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets from the server to the client are sent back without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; passing through the balancer, a technique known as direct<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server return, but we are not concerned here with the return<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer uses an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP-in-IP tunnel to reach it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Each server has its own IP address, and the balancer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performs NAPT (network address and port translation) to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deliver the client's packets to that address.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The choice between these methods is not affected by use of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Rather techniques used today by stateful l3/l4 load balancers to mitigate dos risk statelessly to protect servers from large packet flows e.g. TCP syn cookies or apply gross security controls e.g. only port 80 connections for example) become ineffective because the attacker generating valid connections can know in advance what source/dest/flow label(s) will be used by to create connections through which packets can be delivered to servers (which is a rather different problem then it being hard to guess what someone else is using). <br>...<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the<br>&nbsp;  only state to be stored is the 2-tuple and the server identifier,<br>&nbsp;  storage requirements will be reduced. <br><br>and a timer apparently, either the 2 minute one from 3697 if we consider that still in force since 6437 doesn't mention it, or some other one. <br>...<br><br>&nbsp; The association between the flow label value and<br>&nbsp;  the server is stored in a table (often called stick table) so that<br>&nbsp;  future connections using the same flow label can be sent to the same<br>&nbsp;  server.<br><br>This presumes the reuse of flow labels by a client. while 6437 presumes the existence of stateful flow label usage models, state entries that&nbsp; last a long time relative to the tcp connections that use them are an expensive proposition for a network device.</div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes the use of the IPv6 flow label field to<br>enhance layer 3/4 load distribution and balancing for large server<br>farms. The main goal of this proposed approach is to improve the<br>performance of most types of L3/L4 load balancers, especially for<br>traffic that includes multiple IPv6 extension headers and for<br>fragmented packets. The document also includes a brief summary of<br>commonly used load balancing techniques to put the proposed mechanism<br>in context.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group had active discussion on the draft and the current<br>text of the draft is representative of the consensus of the working<br>group.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document has received adequate review. The Document Shepherd has<br>no concerns about the depth or breadth of these reviews. There are no<br>known implementations of this document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Suresh Krishnan is the document shepherd. Ted Lemon is the<br>responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd has reviewed the draft and finds that it is<br>ready to advance to the IESG. All issues that were raised in the<br>working group last calls have been addressed.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No. The document shepherd has no such concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>Yes. I think the document could benefit from further review from<br>people with operational expertise (especially people who run huge<br>server farms with load balancers). I did manage to get a solicited<br>review from a load balancer vendor.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>We have not had much content provider participation in this work.

If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being<br>silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The WG consensus behind this document has been pretty stable but not<br>very strong. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent?
