That primary deployment scenario (or any other for that matter) is not described in the document (Figures 1 and 2 don't provide enough context of the location of the router-modem link).&nbsp; Describing it could ease some concerns at the lack of security.<br><br>B. Even if L2 security is present, there are still cases where the system could be compromised.&nbsp; Again, explaining the primary scenario would help.&nbsp; But it probably won't stop people from asking "what if that primary scenario is not used?", or even from using DLEP in less secure (physically and from the L2 point of view) deployments.<br><br>I'm not suggesting you add authentication or encryption, but that you consider what would be needed if the expected deployment is not implemented.&nbsp; Besides describing that expected deployment, you might want to add to the Security Considerations a section that says something like: "If the expected deployment is not implemented, then additional security mechanisms should be considered, such as….".<br><br>I will wait for the "Major" comments (below) to be addressed before starting the IETF Last Call.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Alvaro.<br><br> <br><br>Major:<br><br>M1. Security Considerations related to the one hop requirement/assumption.&nbsp; Back in version –18 there was a thread in which I participated related to the assumption vs requirement of DLEP working in a one hop environment.&nbsp; Stan posted a message [1] related to the fact that the one hop deployment is not an assumption, but a requirement — it seemed to me that the WG agreed with that (the Chairs can correct me if I'm wrong).&nbsp; However, the current version of the document still has language about assumptions (specifically Section 2.1. (Assumptions)).&nbsp; Please clearly state the requirements: (something along the lines of) "DLEP MUST be implemented on a single L2 domain".&nbsp; Stan's message also included a short description of why a multi-hop implementation just wouldn't work (because the MAC addresses wouldn't be connected) -- that seems like a good piece of text to include somewhere as well.<br><br>M1.1 How is the one-hop connection enforced?&nbsp;  It is obvious that off-segment MAC addresses won't work, but it is not obvious to me how to prevent the connection from being more than directly connected.&nbsp; A non-directly connected modem (or someone acting as one) may inject information about local MAC Addresses that is simply incorrect.&nbsp; Was <a href="/doc/rfc5082/">rfc5082</a> (The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)) considered?<br><br>[1] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/manet/-tsnTSwkRXtlY3Ng9Dva12GH808">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/manet/-tsnTSwkRXtlY3Ng9Dva12GH808</a> <br><br><br><br>M2. Use of MAC addresses.&nbsp; Part of the justification above about the requirement for a one hop deployment is that the MAC addresses of the destination simply won't be connected: "DLEP identifies destinations by using the MAC address for delivering data traffic."&nbsp; However, DLEP is not a routing protocol, in this context "destination" is defined by this text in Section 2. (Protocol Overview): "The router/modem session provides a carrier for information exchange concerning 'destinations' that are available via the modem device.&nbsp; Destinations…represent a specific, addressable location that can be reached via the link(s) managed by the modem."&nbsp; I interpret that text as talking about the next-hop for a routing protocol — and not the end destination.<br><br>M2.2 Please clarify the use of "destination".&nbsp; There are several flavors through the document.&nbsp; Maybe use something like "local destination" to refer to that one identified by the MAC address.&nbsp; It should be useful to clarify the terminology somewhere.<br><br>M2.3 Without DLEP, on a "normal" ethernet link, the routing protocol will discover its routing neighbors and then the router will ARP (or use the MAC address learned from the Hellos) to eventually encapsulate traffic to the next hop, for destinations beyond.&nbsp; DLEP seems to want — and maybe even constrain routing protocol neighbor discovery to just what DLEP communicates.<br><br>M2.3.1 Is that the intent?&nbsp; If so, then please be explicit about it.&nbsp; I can see the advantages in not blindly trying to discover who is out there…<br><br>M2.3.2 Are there any deployment scenarios where an interface would be shared between DLEP participants and non-DLEP participants (other local routers, for example)?&nbsp; I'm assuming that maybe two routers sharing the same modem might be ok (is it?) -- in that case the routers might want to talk to each other.<br><br><br><br>M3. Preconfigured TCP parameters on the router.&nbsp; Let's see if I understand the Peer Discovery (4.1) and Session Initialization (4.2) correctly…&nbsp; During Peer Discovery the modem may offer (using a Peer Offer Signal) a series of address/port pairs for the router to initialize a session to…if nothing is offered, then the router "MUST use the source address of the UDP packet containing the Signal as the IP address, and the DLEP well-known port number".&nbsp; But the router may not use Peer Discovery at all and just be preconfigured with an IP/port pair.&nbsp; Is my understanding correct?<br><br>M3.1 The "packet containing the Signal" is the one containing the Peer Offer Signal, right?&nbsp; Please don't let the reader guess.<br><br>M.3.2 How does the modem verify that the preconfigured router is really one that should be establishing a DLEP connection?&nbsp; It seems like the preconfigured option puts the modem in a promiscuous mode where it has to listen for a TCP connection (and eventually a segment containing a Session Initialization Message) on any port, and any of its configured IP addresses.&nbsp; This mode seems to open a door for anyone (on the local L2, even post 802.1x authentication) to send random packets to the modem, which won't know if the session is valid until after establishment.&nbsp; <br><br>M3.2 (Following one of the points above…)&nbsp; Note that without being able to enforce the one-hop connection (using <a href="/doc/rfc5082/">rfc5082</a>, for example), then these packets could come from anywhere (IOW, I don't even have to break into the "tank"!!).<br><br><br><br>Minor:&nbsp; <br><br>p1. It would be very nice/useful to include a reference to the appendixes somewhere in the text.<br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>n1. "Addressing the challenges listed above, the co-authors have developed the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol, or DLEP."&nbsp; s/the co-authors/the WG or just leave it generic: "To address…DLEP has been developed."<br><br>n2. "SCTP port allocation is not required."&nbsp; Seems unnecessary.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents.

The DLEP protocol provides this channel by defining signals to be passed between a router and its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to communicate link characteristics as they change, and convergence events (acquisition and loss of potential routing destinations). The signals are used to communicate events that occur on the physical link(s) managed by the modem to the attached routers.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Development of the DLEP document has taken quite some time with a few major revisions along the way.&nbsp; DLEP has previously passed WGLC but was then sent back to the WG after an extensive RtgDir review.&nbsp; As a result the document was split into two documents the base specification (this document) and one for a credit windowing extension.&nbsp; There were also some minor technical changes were made, some major editorial changes were done.<br><br>Previous changes of note: the change between UDP based messaging format into a TCP based messaging paradigm, a change of messaging format from <a href="/doc/rfc5444/">RFC5444</a> (MANET packet building block) to a newly developed DLEP specific packet format, and the change from stateless communication to state-full communication session.&nbsp; <br><br>There is support within the working group on moving this document forward.&nbsp; Previous areas of contention within DLEP were worked out within the working group with no serious objections regarding the final compromise decisions.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the protocol, the Shepherd knows of at least 4 independant ones.&nbsp; There is broad support within industry and the Shepard fully expects many more implementations once standardized and well as demand on the customer side.&nbsp; The document quality was addressed extensively in the RtgDir review and subsequent WG discussions.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd is Justin Dean<br>Area Director Alvaro Retana<br>Directorate Reviewer: Lou Burger<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Proposed Standard is appropriate.&nbsp; There are many years of experience with similar technologies within industry.&nbsp; Much of the experience comes in the form of similar but non-standard stand-alone implementations (wi-fi drivers and radio waveforms drivers) but the IETF does have experience with similar drafts pppoe and LMP.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions.&nbsp; In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions.&nbsp; A bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem is necessary. The DLEP protocol provides this channel by defining signals to be passed between a router and its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to communicate link characteristics as they change, and convergence events (acquisition and loss of potential routing destinations). The signals are used to communicate events that occur on the physical link(s) managed by the modem to the attached routers.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Development of the DLEP document has taken quite some time with a few major revisions along the way.&nbsp; DLEP has previously passed WGLC but was then sent back to the WG after an extensive RtgDir review.&nbsp; As a result the document was split into two documents the base specification (this document) and one for a credit windowing extension.&nbsp; There were also some minor technical changes were made, some major editorial changes were done.<br><br>Previous changes of note: the change between UDP based messaging format into a TCP based messaging paradigm, a change of messaging format from <a href="/doc/rfc5444/">RFC5444</a> (MANET packet building block) to a newly developed DLEP specific packet format, and the change from stateless communication to state-full communication session.&nbsp; <br><br>There is support within the working group on moving this document forward.&nbsp; Previous areas of contention within DLEP were worked out within the working group with no serious objections regarding the final compromise decisions.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the protocol, the Shepherd knows of at least 4 independant ones.&nbsp; There is broad support within industry and the Shepard fully expects many more implementations once standardized and well as demand on the customer side.&nbsp; The document quality was addressed extensively in the RtgDir review and subsequent WG discussions.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd is Justin Dean<br>Area Director Alvaro Retana<br>Directorate Reviewer: Lou Burger<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Shepherd has read the draft document (and multiple previous versions).&nbsp; Recent updates (after document was sent back to the WG) resolves the shepherds previous concerns about outstanding issues raised in the RgtDir review.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>A security review would be appropriate.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The Shepherd has apprehension about the current security approach but does not have expertise in the area. Regardless the documented security approach has been discussed in depth within the WG.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Proposed Standard is appropriate.&nbsp; There are many years of experience with similar technologies within industry.&nbsp; Much of the experience comes in the form of similar but non-standard stand-alone implementations (wi-fi drivers and radio waveforms drivers) but the IETF does have experience with similar drafts pppoe and LMP.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions.&nbsp; In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions.&nbsp; A bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem is necessary. The DLEP protocol provides this channel by defining signals to be passed between a router and its attached modem devices, allowing the modem to communicate link characteristics as they change, and convergence events (acquisition and loss of potential routing destinations). The signals are used to communicate events that occur on the physical link(s) managed by the modem to the attached routers.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Development of the DLEP document has taken quite some time with a few major revisions along the way.&nbsp; Of note: the change between UDP based messaging format into a TCP based messaging paradigm, a change of messaging format from <a href="/doc/rfc5444/">RFC5444</a> (MANET packet building block) to a newly developed DLEP specific packet format, and the change from stateless communication to state-full communication session.&nbsp; <br><br>There is broad support within the working group on moving this document forward.&nbsp; Previous areas of contention within DLEP were worked out within the working group with no serious objections regarding the final decisions.&nbsp; Of note: experimental extensions definitions and credit windowing metric as a default or extended feature.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the protocol, the Shepherd knows of at least 4 independant ones.&nbsp; There is broad support within industry and the Shepard fully expects many more implementations once standardized and well as demand on the customer side.&nbsp; Two specific reviews were quite extensive and relevant to the 13 draft version.&nbsp; Lou Berger who was assigned to do the RtgDir review and Ronald in'tVelt (an implementer) who's review was posted just after wg last call had ended.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd is Justin Dean<br>Area Director Alvaro Retana<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Shepherd has read the draft document (and multiple previous versions).&nbsp; The shepherd believes that a further revision is required for publication to address issues raised in reviews after WG last call.&nbsp; The issues raised are not substantive enough to hold the document up within the working group as they do not affect any consensus within the working group.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>A security review would be appropriate.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The Shepherd has one area of hesitation due to the transmission from a stateless to a state-full communication model as well, as the move from UDP to TCP based communication as the document evolved.&nbsp; Conflicts regarding protocol state due to this evolution is a concern due to possible conflicting bits of text, having reviewed previous documents the shepherd isn't well positioned to see these possible conflicts. Protocol state was discussed within the WG and there is consensus to move the document forward.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The WG as a whole understands and agrees with it moving forward. Strongly.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist).

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document defines 4 new registry spaces and requests a well known port/multicast address.&nbsp; These registries are clearly identified although initial values are not supplied but are currently listed in tables as TBD.&nbsp; Reasonable names are provided for the new registries.&nbsp; The newly created registries have a detailed list of initial valid entries are (albit without numbers assigned) but the document doesn't provide guidance for future assignments although expert review is implied it should be made explicit.&nbsp; Experimental space reservations are requested within two of the registries but the size of the reserveration request is not presented.&nbsp; <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.
