The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate<br>&nbsp;  assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route<br>&nbsp;  learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit<br>&nbsp;  provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider to<br>&nbsp;  another transit provider or a lateral peer.&nbsp; Existing approaches to<br>&nbsp;  leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration,<br>&nbsp;  with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP<br>&nbsp;  neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the<br>&nbsp;  relationship.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  This document enhances BGP OPEN to establish agreement<br>&nbsp;  of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route Server client)<br>&nbsp;  relationship of two neighboring eBGP speakers to enforce appropriate<br>&nbsp;  configuration on both sides.&nbsp; Propagated routes are then marked with<br>&nbsp;  an Only to Customer (OTC) attribute according to the agreed<br>&nbsp;  relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Route leaks are a problem that plague the operational Internet for over 20 years. <br>The WG group consensus for this draft goes across two WGs (GROW and IDR) <br>with both working group lending their support to define the problem <br>and design a series of fixes that can be deployed in operational networks. <br>While the discussions have been lengthy, there is solid support between<br>operators, researchers, and the membesrs of 2 WGs (GROW and IDR). <br>standardize the changs to the OPEN and the additions of an "only<br>to customer" (OTC) flag. <br> <br>Document Quality:<br>The shepherd has been an active part of guiding this discussion in IDR and<br>grow for over 5 years.&nbsp; The work from NIST (Doug Montgomery and&nbsp; K. Sriram)<br>Brian Dickson, Randy Bush (IIJ, Arrcus), Keyur Patel (Arrcus), and<br>Alexander Azimov and Eugene Bogomazov has investigated <br>the technology from many angles.&nbsp; The operators and the authors <br>have word smithed in the last editions to the shepherd's <br>satisfaction. <br><br>Existing implementations: <br><a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy</a><br><br>No MIB, Yang, or Media review: none needed. <br>Key review:&nbsp; Cross-review with Grow WG that depends on this work<br>Reviews in Progress: RTG-IDR, OPS-DIR, and IANA early reviews called for<br> [requested as anticipated document will be in ADs for at least<br>&nbsp; 3 weeks.] <br><br>Personnel: <br>Document Shepherd:&nbsp; Susan Hares <br>AD: Alvaro Retana <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. <br><br>Review done of technology (5+ years) <br>Review of the write-ups and web-sites of the implementator<br>NITS:&nbsp; a) MUST NOT, b) <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a> must replace <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC5226</a> <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br>No see above write-up for reason. <br><br>Early OPS-DIR, RTG-DIR, SEC-DIR, IANA reviews done while in queue. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.&nbsp; See discussion above. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Thanks for all the work that went into it, and into the shepherding. I do have a few points I’d like to raise.<br><br>1. Section 4 talks about policy in several places. As you know, “policy” is a term with quite a bit of baggage in BGP, and without further qualification, it’s likely to be interpreted as “routing policy configured by the router’s operator”. I wondered at first if your choice of “policy” was deliberate, to imply that the specification is not expected to be hard coded into the implementation, but rather configured (or not) by the operator? But, the whole point of the spec is to move away from using policy configuration to protect against route leaks — requiring configuration to enact the import and export “policies” given in §4 would fly in the face of the document’s raison d’être. Furthermore, you close §4 with “the operator MUST NOT have the ability to modify the policies defined in this section” — and that does help, but not before considerable potential confusion is created by the unfortunate choice of terminology.  <br><br>So, I think you mean that import rules (1)-(3) and export rules (1)-(2) MUST be hard coded into any compliant implementation. I strongly suggest you find a term other than “policy” to express what you mean. For example, “procedures” seems like a good replacement. You could say something like “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route reception” and “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route transmission”. (You could also try to put it in terms of <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC 4271</a>, but it might be a bit painful.)

As you know, “policy” is a term with quite a bit of baggage in BGP, and without further qualification, it’s likely to be interpreted as “routing policy configured by the router’s operator”. I wondered at first if your choice of “policy” was deliberate, to imply that the specification is not expected to be hard coded into the implementation, but rather configured (or not) by the operator? But, the whole point of the spec is to move away from using policy configuration to protect against route leaks — requiring configuration to enact the import and export “policies” given in §4 would fly in the face of the document’s raison d’être. Furthermore, you close §4 with “the operator MUST NOT have the ability to modify the policies defined in this section” — and that does help, but not before considerable potential confusion is created by the unfortunate choice of terminology.  <br><br>So, I think you mean that import rules (1)-(3) and export rules (1)-(2) MUST be hard coded into any compliant implementation. I strongly suggest you find a term other than “policy” to express what you mean. For example, “procedures” seems like a good replacement. You could say something like “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route reception” and “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route transmission”. (You could also try to put it in terms of <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC 4271</a>, but it might be a bit painful.)

I wondered at first if your choice of “policy” was deliberate, to imply that the specification is not expected to be hard coded into the implementation, but rather configured (or not) by the operator? But, the whole point of the spec is to move away from using policy configuration to protect against route leaks — requiring configuration to enact the import and export “policies” given in §4 would fly in the face of the document’s raison d’être. Furthermore, you close §4 with “the operator MUST NOT have the ability to modify the policies defined in this section” — and that does help, but not before considerable potential confusion is created by the unfortunate choice of terminology.  <br><br>So, I think you mean that import rules (1)-(3) and export rules (1)-(2) MUST be hard coded into any compliant implementation. I strongly suggest you find a term other than “policy” to express what you mean. For example, “procedures” seems like a good replacement. You could say something like “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route reception” and “the following procedures apply to the processing of the OTC Attribute during route transmission”. (You could also try to put it in terms of <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC 4271</a>, but it might be a bit painful.) I just grepped through §4 and a simple replacement of “policy” with “procedure” throughout seems like it would be almost sufficient.  <br><br>I was ready to make this a DISCUSS until I came to the final sentence of §4. That sentence does clarify matters sufficiently to reach the minimum bar, but I think the document would be even more usable if further edits are made along the lines above. <br><br>2. Section 4 says<br><br>  &nbsp;  The OTC Attribute may be set by the egress policy of the remote AS or<br> &nbsp;  by the ingress policy of the local AS.  <br><br>First, my earlier comment about “policy” applies here as well — you could maybe say “on egress from the remote AS or on ingress to the local AS”. Beyond that, I suggest changing the “may” (which is admittedly lower-case”) to a “might”, which has even less risk of confusion with any kind of normative meaning. Presumably what you mean is actually that if the remote AS is noncompliant with this spec, the local AS will have to set the attribute, and this is a feature, not a bug. <br><br>3. In Section 4 you write, <br><br>&nbsp;  The same OTC Attribute which is set locally also provides<br>&nbsp;  a way to detect route leaks by an AS multiple hops away if a route is<br>&nbsp;  received from a Customer, Peer, or RS-Client.<br><br>I don’t understand this sentence, as written. I think maybe it needs to be several sentences. I don’t think it’s needed, or even desirable, to explain in detail in this document how you might make use of the OTC Attribute for troubleshooting, but if there’s a different document that does explain it, an informative reference might not hurt. I’m pretty sure I remember this being covered in one or more IDR and/or GROW presentations, but I don’t know if it got written down beyond slide sets.<br><br>4. In §1 you say “This document provides configuration automation using BGP Roles”. The document, per se, doesn’t provide any such thing of course — an implementation of the specification would provide such. “This document specifies” would be more correct I think.  <br><br>A second point related to the same sentence is that it feels like a poor fit to refer to what you do in this spec as configuration automation, a term more usually associated with, well, automatic, typically database-driven, generation and management of (router) configurations. In the second ¶ of §1, you identify configuration as the bad, error-prone, legacy way of preventing route leaks. So maybe something like, “This document specifies a means of replacing the configuration-based method of route leak prevention, described above, with a more automated method using BGP Roles,”<br><br>5. In your Terminology Section (§1.1) you define a number of terms that are defined again, immediately, in §2, namely Provider, Customer, RS, RS-Client, and Peer. I think the definitions provided in §2 are better than those in §1.1, and sufficient unto themselves, and that you could remove the first ¶ of §1.1.  <br><br>6. You refer to transit and non-transit providers in many places throughout the document. Although these seem to some of us like well-known terms of art that need no reference, I have the feeling that may not be true for our entire community, or worse still, different people might all “know” what it means but with different definitions, and so it might be desirable to provide a citation. <br><br>7. Have you given any thought to Autonomous System Migration Mechanisms (<a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC 7705</a>)? Mostly, I just have a free-floating concern here, because with the hacks described in <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC 7705</a>, a given router may represent itself as any one of several different ASes, and you do ASN embedding and enforcement. Most likely there would be no problem, since the egress rules in §4 suggest the OTC attribute is to be attached as part of route transmission; therefore, a router might be expected to attach whatever value is appropriate based on the ASN it’s currently representing itself as. It might still be worth adding a note cautioning implementors about this, though, since implementations tend to do things for the sake of efficiency that spec authors aren’t expecting. One optimization pattern is to pre-build updates and copy them to many different transport connections; in such cases the OTC value might be prepopulated and the implementor might need to give extra attention to the exception case where a particular transport connection is representing a different ASN.</div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate<br>&nbsp;  assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route<br>&nbsp;  learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit<br>&nbsp;  provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider to<br>&nbsp;  another transit provider or a lateral peer.&nbsp; Existing approaches to<br>&nbsp;  leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration,<br>&nbsp;  with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP<br>&nbsp;  neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the<br>&nbsp;  relationship.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  This document enhances BGP OPEN to establish agreement<br>&nbsp;  of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route Server client)<br>&nbsp;  relationship of two neighboring eBGP speakers to enforce appropriate<br>&nbsp;  configuration on both sides.&nbsp; Propagated routes are then marked with<br>&nbsp;  an Only to Customer (OTC) attribute according to the agreed<br>&nbsp;  relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Route leaks are a problem that plague the operational Internet for over 20 years. <br>The WG group consensus for this draft goes across two WGs (GROW and IDR) <br>with both working group lending their support to define the problem <br>and design a series of fixes that can be deployed in operational networks. <br>While the discussions have been lengthy, there is solid support between<br>operators, researchers, and the membesrs of 2 WGs (GROW and IDR). <br>standardize the changs to the OPEN and the additions of an "only<br>to customer" (OTC) flag. <br> <br>Document Quality:<br>The shepherd has been an active part of guiding this discussion in IDR and<br>grow for over 5 years.&nbsp; The work from NIST (Doug Montgomery and&nbsp; K. Sriram)<br>Brian Dickson, Randy Bush (IIJ, Arrcus), Keyur Patel (Arrcus), and<br>Alexander Azimov and Eugene Bogomazov has investigated <br>the technology from many angles.&nbsp; The operators and the authors <br>have word smithed in the last editions to the shepherd's <br>satisfaction. <br><br>Existing implementations: <br><a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy</a><br><br>No MIB, Yang, or Media review: none needed. <br>Key review:&nbsp; Cross-review with Grow WG that depends on this work<br>Reviews in Progress: RTG-IDR, OPS-DIR, and IANA early reviews called for<br> [requested as anticipated document will be in ADs for at least<br>&nbsp; 3 weeks.] <br><br>Personnel: <br>Document Shepherd:&nbsp; Susan Hares <br>AD: Alvaro Retana <br>Co-chairs: Susan Hares and John Scudder. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. <br><br>Review done of technology (5+ years) <br>Review of the write-ups and web-sites of the implementator<br>NITS:&nbsp; a) MUST NOT, b) <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a> must replace <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC5226</a> <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br>No see above write-up for reason. <br><br>Early OPS-DIR, RTG-DIR, SEC-DIR, IANA reviews done while in queue. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.&nbsp; See discussion above. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes which violate<br>&nbsp;  assumptions of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route<br>&nbsp;  learned from one lateral peer to another lateral peer or a transit<br>&nbsp;  provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider to<br>&nbsp;  another transit provider or a lateral peer.&nbsp; Existing approaches to<br>&nbsp;  leak prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration,<br>&nbsp;  with no check that the configuration corresponds to that of the eBGP<br>&nbsp;  neighbor, or enforcement that the two eBGP speakers agree on the<br>&nbsp;  relationship.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  This document enhances BGP OPEN to establish agreement<br>&nbsp;  of the (peer, customer, provider, Route Server, Route Server client)<br>&nbsp;  relationship of two neighboring eBGP speakers to enforce appropriate<br>&nbsp;  configuration on both sides.&nbsp; Propagated routes are then marked with<br>&nbsp;  an Only to Customer (OTC) attribute according to the agreed<br>&nbsp;  relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route leaks.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Route leaks are a problem that plague the operational Internet for over 20 years. <br>The WG group consensus for this draft goes across two WGs (GROW and IDR) <br>with both working group lending their support to define the problem <br>and design a series of fixes that can be deployed in operational networks. <br>While the discussions have been lengthy, there is solid support between<br>operators, researchers, and the membesrs of 2 WGs (GROW and IDR). <br>standardize the changs to the OPEN and the additions of an "only<br>to customer" (OTC) flag. <br> <br>Document Quality:<br>The shepherd has been an active part of guiding this discussion in IDR and<br>grow for over 5 years.&nbsp; The work from NIST (Doug Montgomery and&nbsp; K.

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br></div></td>
