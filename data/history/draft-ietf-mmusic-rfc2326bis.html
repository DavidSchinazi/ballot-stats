I'm going to call out in the comments some<br>bits that I found particularly troublesome, and will try to suggest<br>alternatives.&nbsp; I also suggest that the responsible AD put in an RFC Editor note<br>asking the editors to pay particular attention here and to give it some heavy<br>editing for language clarity.&nbsp; This is a complex document, and a good overview<br>in clear English will really help.&nbsp; Here's a suggestion for text for an RFC<br>Editor note:<br>------------------------------<br>RFC Editor note:<br>Section 2 of this document and its subsections provide "an informative overview<br>of the different mechanisms in the RTSP 2.0 protocol, to give the reader a high<br>level understanding".&nbsp; As such, it's very important that it be clear and well<br>written.&nbsp; Some reviewers have found the English to be difficult.&nbsp; Please take<br>an especially critical pen to this section, making sure that the grammar and<br>usage are correct, and that the language is clear.<br>------------------------------<br><br>Comments that have not been addressed in -39:<br><br>-- Section 4.7.2 --<br><br>&nbsp;

 Time-Duration:&nbsp; Each individual unit of the media will be retained<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the specified duration.<br><br>What does "each individual unit of the media" mean?<br><br>-- Section 4.7.3 --<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; Immutable, Retention: Unlimited or Time-Limited.<br><br>-- Section 5.1 --<br><br>&nbsp;  In the interest of robustness, agents MUST ignore any empty line(s)<br>&nbsp;  received where a Request-Line or Response-Line is expected.&nbsp; In other<br>&nbsp;  words, if the agent is reading the protocol stream at the beginning<br>&nbsp;  of a message and receives a CRLF first, it MUST ignore the CRLF.<br><br>What's a "Response-Line"?&nbsp; I also presume the last sentence above is applicable<br>recursively (you want to ignore any number of leading CRLF sequences), yes?<br> Might be good to be clear about that.<br><br>-- Section 9.3 --<br><br>HTTP and email have both historically had horrendous problems with inaccurate<br>or missing Content-Type headers.&nbsp; It's good that you use MUST for Content-Type;<br>that has to help.&nbsp; I would be happier (though not at DISCUSS level) if you<br>should say a few more words about Content-Type here: something about how it<br>MUST accurately specify the type and subtype of the content, that there are no<br>defaults for type or subtype, and that attempts to use heuristics to<br>second-guess this are Very Bad.<br><br>-- Section 10.2 --<br><br>&nbsp;  The scheme of the RTSP URI (Section 4.2)<br>&nbsp;  indicates the default port that the server will listen on if the port<br>&nbsp;  is not explicitly given.<br><br>The URI is created by the client, not the server, so it doesn't specify what<br>port the server "will listen on."&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; session, without the client first issuing new requests related<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the pending request.<br>END<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid this problem an RTSP agent<br>&nbsp;  is recommended to buffer incoming messages locally so that any<br>&nbsp;  response messages can be processed immediately upon reception.<br><br>Thus doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; If you're buffering them, you're not processing<br>each one immediately, right?&nbsp; You won't process a message until it has its turn<br>to be popped out of the buffer.&nbsp; What are you really trying to say here?<br><br>-- Section 10.7 --<br><br>&nbsp;  However, this can cause the situation where multiple RTSP clients<br>&nbsp;  again send requests to a proxy or server at roughly the same time<br>&nbsp;  which may again cause an overload situation, or if the "old" overload<br>&nbsp;  situation is not yet solved, i.e., the length indicated in the Retry-<br>&nbsp;  After header was too short.<br><br>I can't parse this (in particular, I can't make sense of what comes after ", or<br>if"); please try re-wording, probably splitting the too-long sentence in the<br>process.<br><br>&nbsp;  A more complex case may arise when a load balancing RTSP proxy is in<br>&nbsp;  use, i.e., where an RTSP proxy is used to select amongst a set of<br>&nbsp;  RTSP servers to handle the requests, or when multiple server<br>&nbsp;  addresses are available for a given server name.<br><br>Here's an example of a problem with using "i.e.": I can't tell what the scope<br>of the "i.e." is.&nbsp; Is it the rest of the sentence ["X (i.e., A, or B)"], or is<br>it just the first part ["X (i.e., A), or B"] ?&nbsp; Please clarify the text.<br><br>&nbsp;  It is REQUIRED to not set the<br>&nbsp;  same value in the timer for each scheduling, but instead to add a<br>&nbsp;  variation to the mean value, resulting in picking a random value<br>&nbsp;  within the range of 0.5 to 1.5 of the mean value.<br><br>Is this meant to say "0.5 to 1.5 *times* the mean value?&nbsp; "Of" doesn't do that.<br><br>-- Section 13.5 --<br><br>&nbsp;  PLAY_NOTIFY requests MAY be used with a message body, depending on<br>&nbsp;  the value of the Notify-Reason header.&nbsp; It is described in the<br>&nbsp;  particular section for each Notify-Reason if a message body is used.<br>&nbsp;  However, currently there is no Notify-Reason that allows using a<br>&nbsp;  message body.<br><br>That last sentence should be a clue that the "MAY" here is wrong.&nbsp; You're not<br>describing an option for the implementor.&nbsp; Depending upon the value of<br>Notify-Reason, either a body is needed or it isn't.&nbsp; You can make this "may",<br>or, better, "will sometimes".<br><br>-- Section 15.1 --<br><br>&nbsp;  However, it is important to consider if this header<br>&nbsp;  and its function is required to be understood by the proxy or can be<br>&nbsp;  forwarded.&nbsp; If the header needs to be understood, a feature-tag<br>&nbsp;  representing the functionality MUST be included in the Proxy-Require<br>&nbsp;  header.&nbsp; Below are guidelines for analysis if the header needs to be<br>&nbsp;  understood.<br><br>In the first sentence, I think you mean, "or can simply be forwarded."&nbsp; That<br>sense is lost without the word "simply".&nbsp; In the last sentence, the guidelines<br>aren't for application only if the header need to be understood; they're<br>guidelines to determine that.&nbsp; So, "Below are guidelines for analyzing<br>whether the header needs to be understood."<br><br>&nbsp;

But I still have a few things I'd<br>like to discuss (sorry;-). Discuss point #1 is the main<br>thing though, if we resolve that, then the others should<br>be easy to clear up.<br><br>(1) 21.1 - "transfer of sensitive information" - I think<br>you need to say here that RTSP *is* less sensitive than<br>HTTP and that's why its ok to have the hop-by-hop scheme.<br>HTTP is more sensitive because users commonly input or<br>read much more sensitive information in HTTP exchanges,<br>e.g.&nbsp; HTTP requests often contain passwords, cookies,<br>cardholder data and responses often contain bank account<br>details, healthcare data, none of which is transported via<br>RTSP. If that is true, then the hop-by-hop scheme is much<br>more reasonable and saying so is important and should help<br>clear my discuss much more easliy. If that is not true<br>(i.e. if really sensitive user information is commonly<br>sent via RTSP) then we need to talk more.<br><br>(2) 15 - "This proxy can also limit the client's access to<br>certain types of content." That's not a security function<br>but really a censorship function, at least as stated. I<br>suggest deleting the sentence, or changing it to one<br>that's suitable.<br><br>(3) 18.8 - is this saying that a 2nd request for the same<br>thing won't need to be authenticated even if that was<br>required for the first request? If not, that's not clear<br>to me.<br><br>(4) 19 - Why is there no equivalent of HTTP CONNECT for<br>TLS?&nbsp; It seems like the choices are to either connect<br>directly over TLS to the origin server or else to have to<br>use a proxy that sees all the plaintext and headers.<br><br>(5) 19.2 - 2nd last para: Why don't you use SNI here? Just<br>wondering, but it'd fix a problem if it worked.<br><br>(6) 19.3 - I think you need to say here (or somewhere)<br>that all TLS "hops" MUST have commensurate security.<br><br>(7) 19.3.2 - how is a user supposed to practically<br>"approve" a proxy with just e.g. an IP address?&nbsp; That<br>seems meaningless.<br><br>(8) 21.1 - Location headers and spoofing - I don't get how<br>the "if" that preceeds the MUST here can be implemented.</div></td>

There is simply no way that this document got the kind of review by enough eyeballs to be able to claim it is "generally stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable." And the fact that there is only one implementation of this does not give me confidence. Robert's GenArt review makes it clear that, due to the length and structure of the document, he has concerns about interoperable implementation. Elwyn did&nbsp; a yeoman's job in his GenArt review, and though he is satisfied that his concerns were addressed, there are still many significant issues: Barry also did a detailed review and has found several problems, and I've got more below. We know that secdir did not do a comprehensive review of this document. I have done a review of this spec at high speed, and therefore at a completely cursory level, and I know that other ADs are in the same boat. I feel that spending the time that would really be needed for a full review would be unfair to other important documents. I don't know how this thing was left to continue for 11 years, to go from an already hefty 90 page document at -00 to this 320 page monstrosity, without it being stopped earlier and at least broken into pieces.&nbsp; Even the document writeup indicates that later versions have not seen WG participation, that the authors have really been the only ones tracking it recently, and that the only thing that can be claimed is "no indication of lack of consensus"; that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. I don't know how, in good conscience, the IESG can move this document forward as representing the consensus of the WG, let alone the consensus of the IETF as a whole. It seems to me that the process failed long ago for this document. And I don't know what, if anything, we can do about it at this point.<br><br>Substantive comments:<br><br>Section 1:<br><br>Strike, ", similar to the remote control for a DVD player" and ", as known from DVD players remote control or media players". They're anachronistic.<br><br>In the discussion of changes from 1.0, I would mention that greenfield implementations should use 2.0 since 1.0 is incomplete.<br><br>Section 2.6: "however, it is recommended to release the session context".

I still haven't decided what ballot position I will take. But here's what I have so far. Most recent addition: Comments on Section 22.]<br><br>This first comment is more for the IESG than the authors; I don't think the authors can really do anything about this now:<br><br>I have a really hard time believing that a document of this size could possibly be independently implementable. There is simply no way that this document got the kind of review by enough eyeballs to be able to claim it is "generally stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable." And the fact that there is only one implementation of this does not give me confidence. Robert's GenArt review makes it clear that, due to the length and structure of the document, he has concerns about interoperable implementation. Elwyn did&nbsp; a yeoman's job in his GenArt review, and though he is satisfied that his concerns were addressed, there are still many significant issues: Barry also did a detailed review and has found several problems, and I've got more below. We know that secdir did not do a comprehensive review of this document. I have done a review of this spec at high speed, and therefore at a completely cursory level, and I know that other ADs are in the same boat. I feel that spending the time that would really be needed for a full review would be unfair to other important documents. I don't know how this thing was left to continue for 11 years, to go from an already hefty 90 page document at -00 to this 320 page monstrosity, without it being stopped earlier and at least broken into pieces.&nbsp; Even the document writeup indicates that later versions have not seen WG participation, that the authors have really been the only ones tracking it recently, and that the only thing that can be claimed is "no indication of lack of consensus"; that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. I don't know how, in good conscience, the IESG can move this document forward as representing the consensus of the WG, let alone the consensus of the IETF as a whole. It seems to me that the process failed long ago for this document. And I don't know what, if anything, we can do about it at this point.<br><br>Substantive comments:<br><br>Section 1:<br><br>Strike, ", similar to the remote control for a DVD player" and ", as known from DVD players remote control or media players". They're anachronistic.<br><br>In the discussion of changes from 1.0, I would mention that greenfield implementations should use 2.0 since 1.0 is incomplete.<br><br>Section 2.6: "however, it is recommended to release the session context". The client or the server? I hope "it is recommended that the client release the session context". I hate when servers tear down sessions even when I am sending a keep-alive. The server may certainly tear it down if it needs the resources, but the document shouldn't recommend that it be torn down.<br><br>Section 10.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  The RTSP agent SHALL NOT use more than one<br>&nbsp;  connection per RTSP session at any given point.<br><br>The explanation given later does not justify the SHALL NOT.

I still haven't decided what ballot position I will take. But here's what I have so far.]<br><br>This first comment is more for the IESG than the authors; I don't think the authors can really do anything about this now:<br><br>I have a really hard time believing that a document of this size could possibly be independently implementable. There is simply no way that this document got the kind of review by enough eyeballs to be able to claim it is "generally stable, has resolved known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community interest to be considered valuable." And the fact that there is only one implementation of this does not give me confidence. Robert's GenArt review makes it clear that, due to the length and structure of the document, he has concerns about interoperable implementation. Elwyn did&nbsp; a yeoman's job in his GenArt review, and though he is satisfied that his concerns were addressed, there are still many significant issues: Barry also did a detailed review and has found several problems, and I've got more below. We know that secdir did not do a comprehensive review of this document. I have done a review of this spec at high speed, and therefore at a completely cursory level, and I know that other ADs are in the same boat. I feel that spending the time that would really be needed for a full review would be unfair to other important documents. I don't know how this thing was left to continue for 11 years, to go from an already hefty 90 page document at -00 to this 320 page monstrosity, without it being stopped earlier and at least broken into pieces.&nbsp; Even the document writeup indicates that later versions have not seen WG participation, that the authors have really been the only ones tracking it recently, and that the only thing that can be claimed is "no indication of lack of consensus"; that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. I don't know how, in good conscience, the IESG can move this document forward as representing the consensus of the WG, let alone the consensus of the IETF as a whole. It seems to me that the process failed long ago for this document. And I don't know what, if anything, we can do about it at this point.<br><br>Substantive comments:<br><br>Section 1:<br><br>Strike, ", similar to the remote control for a DVD player" and ", as known from DVD players remote control or media players". They're anachronistic.<br><br>In the discussion of changes from 1.0, I would mention that greenfield implementations should use 2.0 since 1.0 is incomplete.<br><br>Section 2.6: "however, it is recommended to release the session context". The client or the server? I hope "it is recommended that the client release the session context". I hate when servers tear down sessions even when I am sending a keep-alive. The server may certainly tear it down if it needs the resources, but the document shouldn't recommend that it be torn down.<br><br>Section 10.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  The RTSP agent SHALL NOT use more than one<br>&nbsp;  connection per RTSP session at any given point.<br><br>The explanation given later does not justify the SHALL NOT. It certainly is useful for the server to only use a single connection, but I see no justification for the REQUIREment.<br><br>&nbsp;  A server that attempts to send a<br>&nbsp;  request to a client that has no connection currently to the server<br>&nbsp;  SHALL discard the request directly.<br><br>I don't know what the word "directly" means here. Can you simply strike it, or is it meaningful?<br><br>Sections 14-16: These seem more like appendices or a separate document rather than part of the main protocol.<br><br>Section 16: This section uses the "we" convention from academic papers. This is distracting and a strange affectation. Please change to "This document", or in some cases simply rewrite the sentence.<br><br>Section 17.1: Title should be "Continue", not "Success".<br><br>Section 17.3: '3rr' is used to distinguish it from HTTP usage of '3xx'? If so, you should say that. Don't all 3rr responses require a Location? If so, put that instruction here, not in 17.3.3. Also, the generic instruction to use 302 for unknown 3rr is probably better here rather than in 17.3.1.<br><br>Section 18.20: "The initial sequence number MAY be any number, however, it is RECOMMENDED to start at 0." That MAY is wrong. Change to "can".<br><br>Section 18.21: You say that you are using "a full date as specified by Section 3.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5322/">RFC5322</a>]". I presume that you are *not* including the obsolete syntax. You should probably say that explicitly. However, the 5322 3.3 syntax without the obsolete forms does not allow for the alphabetic time zones like "GMT". It only permits the numeric time zones. If you really want to do that, you should change the examples in throughout the document to "+0000". Otherwise, you could explicitly allow obs-zone, but not the rest. Also, be aware that 5322 3.3 syntax is allowed to end with CFWS. Are you OK with that?<br><br>(Note again: I did not scrub the ABNF. These are only the things I found from a quick review.)<br><br>Section 20.1: Is there a reason for not just importing the 5234 core rules?<br><br>&nbsp;  UTF8-NONASCII&nbsp; &nbsp; = UTF8-1 / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4<br>&nbsp;  UTF8-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = <br><br>That's wrong. You want to strike UTF8-1 and just say: "UTF8-NONASCII = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4"<br><br>UTF8-CONT is unnecessary. You should use UTF8-tail, which is defined in 3629. The only two places it appears are in header-value (more on that below) and in Appendix F, which should be using the UTF8-NONASCII syntax from here, not re-creating it.<br><br>Section 20.2.1: Do you really want header-value to have UTF8-CONT freely distributed? That seems wrong. I think UTF8-CONT probably should be struck. (If you want to allow any octet, not part of a UTF-8 sequence, and not ASCII controls, use TEXT instead.)</div></td>

This point falls into the "URI/IRI follies" category:<br><br>-- Section 3.2 --<br><br>   IRI:  Internationalized Resource Identifier, is the same as a URI,<br>      with the exception that it allows characters from the whole<br><br>Oh, my; please don't say that it's "the same as a URI".  It'd be reasonable to say "is similar to a URI, but allows characters [etc]."<br><br>-- Section 4.2 --<br><br>   The RTSP URI and IRI are case sensitive, with the exception of those<br>   parts that [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc3987/">RFC3987</a>] define as case-insensitive; for<br>   example, the scheme and host part.<br><br>Clumping URIs and IRIs together in such a vague way with respect to case mapping is a dangerous thing.&nbsp; And unless there's a particular reason to say otherwise, it's easy to avoid that by specifically saying that the scheme and host parts are the *only* case-sensitive bits (which is true of generic URIs and IRIs anyway).&nbsp; Is there really a reason not to be clearer, this way?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The "scheme" and "host" parts of all URIs [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] and IRIs [<a href="/doc/rfc3987/">RFC3987</a>]<br>&nbsp;  are case-insensitive.&nbsp; All other parts of RTSP URIs and IRIs are case-<br>&nbsp;  sensitive, and SHOULD NOT be case-mapped.<br>END<br><br>2. The paragraph in Section 4.4.2 that explains npt-hhmmss notation and npt-sec notation has some internal inconsistencies that have to be fixed.&nbsp; See my suggestions in the comments section below, which goes beyond the blocking point (the inconsistency) and tries to make the paragraph more readable as well.<br><br>3. Two bits in Section 10.5:<br><br>&nbsp;  The mechanisms for showing liveness of the client is, any RTSP<br>&nbsp;  request with a Session header, if RTP &amp; RTCP is used an RTCP message,<br>&nbsp;  or through any other used media protocol capable of indicating<br>&nbsp;  liveness of the RTSP client.<br><br>The grammar and punctuation in that sentence is so fractured that I haven't the first idea what it means.&nbsp; It needs to be re-worded, and I can't help.<br><br>&nbsp;  SET_PARAMETER:&nbsp; When using SET_PARAMETER for keep-alive, a body<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SHOULD NOT be included.&nbsp; This method is the RECOMMENDED RTSP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  method to use for a request intended only to perform keep-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  alive.<br><br>But a short bit above, in Section 10.4, you say this:<br><br>&nbsp;  The keep-alive request will normally<br>&nbsp;  be a GET_PARAMETER with a session header to inform the server that<br>&nbsp;  this agent cares about this RTSP session.<br><br>If SET_PARAMETER is what's RECOMMENDED, then why do you say that it "will normally be" GET_PARAMETER?<br><br>4. In Section 11.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus following all normative parts in the main sections (the<br>&nbsp;  ones with numbers), but omitting the appendices (starting with<br>&nbsp;  letters), unless explicitly specified in a main section as being a<br>&nbsp;  required appendix.<br><br>This is not a complete sentence, so I can't figure it out.&nbsp; What do you mean to say here?&nbsp; You appear to be making some statement about the applicability of the document as a whole, yet that statement is buried down in Section 11.1.&nbsp; After turning this into a proper sentence, you might (depending upon what it really is that you're saying) need to promote it to someplace where it's earlier on and more obvious.<br><br>On the section as a whole, and the meaning of the play.basic feature-tag: Am I to understand that this feature-tag is basically used to say, "I support the basic spec for RTSP 2.0." ?&nbsp; If so, that can (and should) be said a lot more clearly, directly, and succinctly.&nbsp; If that's not right, then this section probably needs to be clearer anyway, because it means I'm not getting it.<br><br>5. In Section 13.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  There is also a third possible<br>&nbsp;  usage for the SETUP method which is not specified in this memo:<br>&nbsp;  adding a media to a session.&nbsp; Using SETUP to add media to an existing<br>&nbsp;  session, when the session is in Play state, is unspecified.<br><br>I don't understand what this is trying to say.&nbsp; If there's a third legitimate use, why does this document mention it, but "not specify" it?&nbsp; What does it mean for it to be "unspecified"?&nbsp; Is using SETUP to add media to an existing session that's in Ready state specified?&nbsp; Where?<br><br>There are other places where you say that something "is unspecified" (later in 13.3, for example, "The SETUP of media streams in an aggregate which has not been given an aggregated control URI is unspecified."): in general, what does that mean?&nbsp; Does it mean it's not permitted?&nbsp; Does it mean that it *is* permitted, but you don't specify how it works?&nbsp; Or what?</div></td>

I would say it this way:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The scheme of the RTSP URI (Section 4.2)<br>&nbsp;  allows the client to specify the port it will contact the server<br>&nbsp;  on, and defines the default port to use if one is not explicitly<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; to the pending request.<br>END<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid this problem an RTSP agent<br>&nbsp;  is recommended to buffer incoming messages locally so that any<br>&nbsp;  response messages can be processed immediately upon reception.<br><br>Thus doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; If you're buffering them, you're not processing each one immediately, right?&nbsp; You won't process a message until it has its turn to be popped out of the buffer.&nbsp; What are you really trying to say here?<br><br>-- Section 10.4 --<br><br>&nbsp;  A responder SHOULD respond to all requests within 5 seconds.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  responder recognizes that processing of a request will take longer<br>&nbsp;  than 5 seconds, it SHOULD send a 100 (Continue) response as soon as<br>&nbsp;  possible.&nbsp; It SHOULD continue sending a 100 response every 5 seconds<br>&nbsp;  thereafter until it is ready to send the final response to the<br>&nbsp;  requester.&nbsp; After sending a 100 response, the receiver MUST send a<br>&nbsp;  final response indicating the success or failure of the request.<br><br>After all this about the "responder"... should that "receiver" in the last sentence be "responder" also?&nbsp; If not, then I don't understand.<br><br>&nbsp;  To mitigate that situation the RTSP agent SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  establish a new connection and send any queued up and non-responded<br>&nbsp;  requests on this new connection.&nbsp; Secondly, to ensure that the RTSP<br>&nbsp;  server knows which connection that is valid for a particular RTSP<br>&nbsp;  session, the RTSP agent SHOULD send a keep-alive request, if no other<br>&nbsp;  request will be sent immediately for that RTSP session, for each RTSP<br>&nbsp;  session on the old connection.<br><br>The second sentence is unclear: it seems to be saying that for each session on the old connection, the agent should send a keep-alive request on the new session.&nbsp; But then there's the "if no other request" modifier.&nbsp; And it's possible to interpret this as saying that the keep-alives should be sent on the old sessions.&nbsp; Can you re-word this (changing the order in which you say things and avoiding too-long sentences) to clarify what you mean?<br><br>-- Section 10.5 --<br><br>&nbsp;  The RTSP message may be lost or when using<br>&nbsp;  reliable protocols, such as TCP, the message may take some time to<br>&nbsp;  arrive safely at the receiver.<br><br>But... doesn't Section 10.1 say this?:<br><br>&nbsp;  Since RTSP messages are transmitted using reliable transport<br>&nbsp;  protocols, they MUST NOT be retransmitted at the RTSP protocol level.<br><br>So, what does the "or when using reliable protocols, such as TCP" mean here?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A downside of using RTCP is that it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  only gives statistical guarantees of reaching the server.<br><br>What are "statistical guarantees"?&nbsp; It seems to me that delivery is guaranteed, or it's not.&nbsp; If it's not, then that's what we should say, no?<br><br>&nbsp;  GET_PARAMETER:&nbsp; When using GET_PARAMETER for keep-alive, no body<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SHOULD be included.<br><br>Why is this worded differently than for "SET_PARAMETER"?&nbsp; The "no body SHOULD" is a confusing structure, and "a body SHOULD NOT" works better.<br><br>-- Section 10.7 --<br><br>&nbsp;  Another scope for overload situation exists, which is the RTSP proxy.<br><br>I find it to be very bad form to spend two paragraphs talking about how 503 signals an overload situation and saying that there are two scopes... and then to spring a third scope and a new 553 response code on the reader.&nbsp; I suggest that you back up and introduce this earlier, probably saying that there are three situations with three scopes, and then explaining each one separately.<br><br>&nbsp;  However, this can cause the situation where multiple RTSP clients<br>&nbsp;  again send requests to a proxy or server at roughly the same time<br>&nbsp;  which may again cause an overload situation, or if the "old" overload<br>&nbsp;  situation is not yet solved, i.e., the length indicated in the Retry-<br>&nbsp;  After header was too short.<br><br>I can't parse this (in particular, I can't make sense of what comes after ", or if"); please try re-wording, probably splitting the too-long sentence in the process.<br><br>&nbsp;  A more complex case may arise when a load balancing RTSP proxy is in<br>&nbsp;  use, i.e., where an RTSP proxy is used to select amongst a set of<br>&nbsp;  RTSP servers to handle the requests, or when multiple server<br>&nbsp;  addresses are available for a given server name.<br><br>Here's an example of a problem with using "i.e.": I can't tell what the scope of the "i.e." is.&nbsp; Is it the rest of the sentence ["X (i.e., A, or B)"], or is it just the first part ["X (i.e., A), or B"] ?&nbsp; Please clarify the text.<br><br>&nbsp;  It is REQUIRED to not set the<br>&nbsp;  same value in the timer for each scheduling, but instead to add a<br>&nbsp;  variation to the mean value, resulting in picking a random value<br>&nbsp;

 Why not just call them "Play" and "Pause", to match the method names?  Having "Halt" and "PAUSE" mean the same thing only seems to invite confusion, no?<br><br>   The support for positioning/searching within a content depends on the<br><br>In plain English, "content" is a collective noun, and can't really have an indefinite article with it.  I suggest that changing "a content" to "media content" (or "a content stream") will work, and I suggest that you make sure the document is consistent with respect to that usage.<br><br>   These are expressed using<br>   one or several independent attributes.  A first attribute is Random<br>   Access, which expresses if positioning can be done, and with what<br>   granularity.<br><br>Using "one or several" is a bit oddly phrased, and one is likely to read it as "one OF several."  Perhaps, "using one or more independent attributes," expresses what you mean?<br><br>Then, how can one have random access without being able to do positioning?  So is "IF positioning can be done" really correct?<br><br>-- Section 2.5 --<br><br>   The delivery of media to the RTSP client is done with a protocol<br>   outside of RTSP and this protocol is determined during the session<br>   establishment.  This document specifies how media is delivered with<br>   RTP [<a href="/doc/rfc3550/">RFC3550</a>] over UDP [<a href="/doc/rfc768/">RFC0768</a>], TCP [<a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC0793</a>] or the RTSP<br>   connection.<br><br>The first sentence says that media delivery doesn't happen through RTSP.  The second sentence seems to say that RTSP can deliver media (it appears to be a third option).  Which is it?<br><br>-- Section 2.5.1 --<br><br>   Scale = 0 is equal to pause and is not allowed.<br><br>If it's not allowed, it's not equal to anything.  I suggest just saying, "Scale = 0 is not allowed."<br><br>   An example<br>   is fast forward where only the independently decodable intra frames<br>   are included in the media stream.<br><br>What are "intra frames"?<br><br>-- Section 2.7 --<br><br>   o  A new version of the protocol can be defined, allowing almost all<br>      aspects (except the position of the protocol version number) to<br>      change.  A new version of the protocol must be registered through<br>      an IETF standards track document.<br><br>Which is, clearly, what you're doing with this document.  It would probably be good to stress that doing this is really a last resort and is extremely disruptive to deployed products.  It should only be used when the designed extension mechanisms have failed.<br><br>-- Section 3.1 --<br><br>   Since a few of the definitions are identical to HTTP/1.1, this<br>   specification only points to the section where they are defined<br>   rather than copying it.  For brevity, [HX.Y] is to be taken to refer<br>   to Section X.Y of the current HTTP/1.1 specification ([<a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a>]).<br><br>Ah, but 2616 is about to not be the current HTTP/1.1 specification; the httpbis set is likely to be approved by the IESG before this RFC is published.  It would be nice to refer to the httpbis set of updates instead, but that would be too disruptive.  I guess just take out the word "current", please.<br><br>-- Section 4.4.2 --<br><br>   The syntax is based on ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.2000].  Two different<br>   notations are allowed.  The npt-hhmmss notation are using a ISO 8601<br>   extended complete representation of the time of the day format<br>   (Section 5.3.1.1 of [ISO.8601.2000]) using colon (":") as separators<br>   between hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss).  With the exception<br>   that it expresses duration since presentation start rather than time<br>   since midnight and the hour counter is not limited to 0-24 hours,<br>   instead up to nineteen (19) digits of hours are allowed.  ISO 8601<br>   time format requires all digits to be used for each format, and all<br>   format required needs to be included, e.g. if one use a hh:mm:ss<br>   format, then that requires two digits for hours, two digits for<br>   minutes and two digits for second, a time value such as 7 minutes and<br>   0 seconds, is expressed as 00:07:00.  The npt-sec notation is<br>   expressing the duration since presentation start in seconds, using<br>   one to nineteen (19) digits.  Both notations allows decimal fractions<br>   of seconds as specified in Section 5.3.1.3 of [ISO.8601.2000] with<br>   the limitation of at maximum of 9 digits and only allowing "." (full<br>   stop) as separator.  Due to RTSP 1.0 and the fact that the highest<br>   values are expanded beyond two digits, all implementations MUST allow<br>   the highest value to be single digit and SHALL NOT send leading zeros<br>   for hours in the npt-hhmmss notation and leading zeros for seconds in<br>   the npt-sec notation.  The hours and the seconds in the npt-hhmmss<br>   notation SHALL be sent using leading zeros, but receivers SHALL<br>   accept values without leading zeros.<br><br>This is too long to have in one block, combines too many things, and has some grammatical problems that make it hard to cope with.  May I, please?:<br><br>NEW<br>   The syntax is based on ISO 8601 [ISO.8601.2000] and expresses<br>   the time elapsed since presentation start, with two different<br>   notations allowed:<br>   <br>   o The npt-hhmmss notation uses an ISO 8601 extended complete<br>     representation of the time of the day format (Section 5.3.1.1<br>     of [ISO.8601.2000]) using colon (":") as separators between<br>     hours, minutes and seconds (hh:mm:ss).  The hour counter is not<br>     limited to 0-24 hours; up to nineteen (19) digits of hours are<br>     allowed.<br>   <br>     In accordance with the requirements of the ISO 8601 time format,<br>     the hours, minutes, and seconds must all be present, with two<br>     digits used for minutes and for seconds, and with a least two<br>     digits for hours.  An NPT of 7 minutes and 0 seconds is<br>     represented as "00:07:00", and an NPT of 392 hours, 0 minutes,<br>     and 6 seconds is represented as "392:00:06".<br>   <br>   o The npt-sec notation expresses the time in seconds, using between<br>     one and nineteen (19) digits.<br>   <br>   Both notations allow decimal fractions of seconds as specified in<br>   Section 5.3.1.3 of [ISO.8601.2000], using at most 9 digits, and<br>   allowing only "."

This point falls into the "URI/IRI follies" category:<br><br>-- Section 3.2 --<br><br>   IRI:  Internationalized Resource Identifier, is the same as a URI,<br>      with the exception that it allows characters from the whole<br><br>Oh, my; please don't say that it's "the same as a URI".  It'd be reasonable to say "is similar to a URI, but allows characters [etc]."<br><br>-- Section 4.2 --<br><br>   The RTSP URI and IRI are case sensitive, with the exception of those<br>   parts that [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc3987/">RFC3987</a>] define as case-insensitive; for<br>   example, the scheme and host part.<br><br>Clumping URIs and IRIs together in such a vague way with respect to case mapping is a dangerous thing.&nbsp; And unless there's a particular reason to say otherwise, it's easy to avoid that by specifically saying that the scheme and host parts are the *only* case-sensitive bits (which is true of generic URIs and IRIs anyway).&nbsp; Is there really a reason not to be clearer, this way?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The "scheme" and "host" parts of all URIs [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] and IRIs [<a href="/doc/rfc3987/">RFC3987</a>]<br>&nbsp;  are case-insensitive.&nbsp; All other parts of RTSP URIs and IRIs are case-<br>&nbsp;  sensitive, and SHOULD NOT be case-mapped.<br>END<br><br>3. The paragraph in Section 4.4.2 that explains npt-hhmmss notation and npt-sec notation has some internal inconsistencies that have to be fixed.&nbsp; See my suggestions in the comments section below, which goes beyond the blocking point (the inconsistency) and tries to make the paragraph more readable as well.<br><br>4. I'm disturbed by this combination in Section 9.2: it appears that Content-Encoding is optional (the first paragraph doesn't say it MUST be included, and the second paragraph uses lower-case-"may" to describe its inclusion), but the second paragraph says that there is no default encoding.&nbsp; So what does it mean to have a message body with no Content-Encoding header?</div></td>

We understand that these registries (Headers, Methods, Option Tags and Status Codes) are to remain in place for compatibility purposes.&nbsp; Is this understanding correct?<br><br>We also understand that the preferred approach to the new RTSP 2.0 registries is to simply create a new file/repository for the v2.0 parameters. Is this understanding correct?<br><br>Upon approval of this document, we understand that there are to be four major actions completed by the IANA:<br><br>1] the creation of 17 new registries (see below) in a registry location to be determined;<br>2] the registration of three new, permanent URI schemes (in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html);">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html);</a> and,<br>3] the registration of three new SDP attributes (in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters</a>)<br>4] the registration of a Media Type for text/parameters (in MIME Media Types registry located at: <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html">http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html</a>.<br><br>Part 1:<br>===We understand that eighteen new registries are to be created.<br><br>1.1 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 feature-tags. The description of the contents of the registry is in section 22.1.1 of the draft document. We understand that future registrations are to be done on a first come, first served basis. We also understand that there are four initial values to be initially registered and that these are documented in section 22.1.3 of the draft. For each item in the RTSP v2.0 feature-tags registry, we understand that four fields will be registered:<br><br>- the name of the feature tag (with rules for the creation of the name documented in section 22.1.2);<br>- a description of the feature tag (a simple text string);<br>- a indication of whether or not the feature tag applies to clients, servers or proxies (non-exclusively). and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value (e.g. RFC, etc.)<br><br>1.2 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Methods. The description of the meaning of RTSP Methods, the content of the registry, is in section 13 of the draft document.<br><br>We understand that future registrations are to be done IETF Standards Action only. We also understand that there are ten initial values to be initially registered and that these are documented in section 22.2.3 of the draft.<br><br>1.3 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Status Codes. We understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Status Codes to be "A status code is the three digit number used to convey information in RTSP response messages." We also understand that future registrations are to be done through IETF Review only. We also understand that there are 46 initial values to be initially registered and that these are to be extracted from the ABNF documentation for "Status-Code" in section 20.2.2 of the draft. For each item in the RTSP v2.0 Status Codes registry, we understand that three fields will be registered:<br><br>- the three digit status code;<br>- the meaning of the status code; and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value.<br><br>1.4 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Headers. We intend to use the description provided in section 22.4.1 of the document for this registry. We understand that future registrations are to be done using Expert Review. We also understand that there are 67 initial values to be initially registered and that these are to be extracted from Section 18 (56 values) and Section 22.4.3 (11 values) of the draft.<br><br>We understand that the registry for RTSP 2.0 Headers will include only the header name and reference for each header.<br><br>1.5 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Accept-Credentials policies.

We understand that these registries (Headers, Methods, Option Tags and Status Codes) are to remain in place for compatibility purposes. Is this understanding correct?<br><br>We also understand that the preferred approach to the new RTSP 2.0 registries is to simply create a new file/repository for the v2.0 parameters. Is this understanding correct?<br><br>Upon approval of this document, we understand that there are to be four major actions completed by the IANA:<br><br>1] the creation of 17 new registries (see below) in a registry location to be determined;<br>2] the registration of three new, permanent URI schemes (in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html);">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html);</a> and,<br>3] the registration of three new SDP attributes (in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters">http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters</a>)<br>4] the registration of a Media Type for text/parameters (in MIME Media Types registry located at: <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html">http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html</a>.<br><br>Part 1:<br>===<br>We understand that eighteen new registries are to be created.<br><br>1.1 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 feature-tags. The description of the contents of the registry is in section 22.1.1 of the draft document. We understand that future registrations are to be done on a first come, first served basis. We also understand that there are four initial values to be initially registered and that these are documented in section 22.1.3 of the draft. For each item in the RTSP v2.0 feature-tags registry, we understand that four fields will be registered:<br><br>- the name of the feature tag (with rules for the creation of the name documented in section 22.1.2);<br>- a description of the feature tag (a simple text string);<br>- a indication of whether or not the feature tag applies to clients, servers or proxies (non-exclusively). and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value (e.g. RFC, etc.)<br><br>1.2 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Methods. The description of the meaning of RTSP Methods, the content of the registry, is in section 13 of the draft document.<br><br>We understand that future registrations are to be done IETF Standards Action only. We also understand that there are ten initial values to be initially registered and that these are documented in section 22.2.3 of the draft.<br><br>1.3 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Status Codes.&nbsp; We understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Status Codes to be "A status code is the three digit number used to convey information in RTSP response messages." We also understand that future registrations are to be done through IETF Review only. We also understand that there are 46 initial values to be initially registered and that these are to be extracted from the ABNF documentation for "Status-Code" in section 20.2.2 of the draft. For each item in the RTSP v2.0 Status Codes registry, we understand that three fields will be registered:<br><br>- the three digit status code;<br>- the meaning of the status code; and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value.<br><br>1.4 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Headers. We intend to use the description provided in section 22.4.1 of the document for this registry. We understand that future registrations are to be done using Expert Review. We also understand that there are 67 initial values to be initially registered and that these are to be extracted from Section 18 (56 values) and Section 22.4.3 (11 values) of the draft.<br><br>We understand that the registry for RTSP 2.0 Headers will include only the header name and reference for each header.<br><br>1.5 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Accept-Credentials policies. IANA understands the description of RTSP v2.0 Accept-Credentials policies to be defined in Section 22.5.1 of the document. We also understand that future registrations are to be done through IETF Standards Action only. We also understand that there are three initial values to be initially registered and that these are "Any" "Proxy" and "User"<br><br>QUESTION --&gt; Beside the name of the Accept-Credentials value and a reference to where it is defined, are there any other fields that should be in this registry based on the definitions in Section 19.3.1 of the document?<br><br>1.6 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Accept-Credentials hash algorithms. <br>We understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Accept-Credentials hash algorithms to be the first sentence of text in Section 22.5.2 of the document.&nbsp; <br>We also understand that future registrations are to be done through IETF Standards Action only.<br><br>We understand that there is a single registration in this registry as follows:<br><br>Hash Alg. Id Reference<br>----------------------------<br>sha-256 [ RFC-to-be ]<br><br>1.7 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Cache Directive Extensions.&nbsp; We<br>understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Cache Directive Extensions to be the first paragraph of the text in section 22.6 of the document.&nbsp; We also understand that future registrations are to be done through IETF Standards Action only.&nbsp; We also understand that there are 10 initial values to be registered upon approval of the document as documented in the text of section 22.6.<br><br>QUESTION --&gt; For the ten initial values in this new registry what name should be used as the contact person?<br><br>For each item in the RTSP v2.0 Cache Directive Extensions registry, We understand that three fields will be registered:<br><br>- the name of the directive;<br>- contact person; and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value.<br><br>1.8 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Media Properties. We understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Media Properties to be the text in section 22.7.1 of the document.<br><br>We also understand that future registrations are to be done using a designated expert. We also understand that there are nine initial values to be registered upon approval of the document and that these are identified in section 16.28 of the document. For each item in the RTSP v2.0 Media Properties registry, we understand that three fields will be registered:<br><br>- the name of the media property;<br>- a contact name for the property;<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value.<br><br>QUESTION --&gt; We understand that the property values identified in Section 16.28 are to be registered but not the property groups. Is this correct? Also, the IANA Considerations section requests that nine values be registered, but in Section 16.28 there appear to be ten values. Is one of the value in 16.28 not to be registered?<br><br>1.9 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Notify Reason Values. We understand the description of RTSP v2.0 Status Codes to be the first three sentences of the text in section 22.8.1 of the document.&nbsp; We also understand that future registrations are to be done using a designated expert. We also understand that there are three initial values to be registered upon approval of the document and that these are to be copied from the documentation provided in Section 22.8.3.<br><br>QUESTION --&gt; For the three initial values in this new registry what name should be used as the contact person?<br><br>For each item in the RTSP v2.0 Notify Reason Values registry, we <br>understand that four fields will be registered:<br><br>- the Notify Reason Value;<br>- the description of the value;<br>- a contact name; and,<br>- a reference for the source of the registry value.<br><br>1.10 A new registry called RTSP v2.0 Range Header formats. We understands the description of RTSP v2.0 Range Header formats should be: "The Range header allows for different range formats."<br><br>We also understand that future registrations are to be done through Specification Required only.

Detailed reviews have been performed by the authors and the <br>document shepherd several times and the document is of high quality at <br>this point. As noted, due to the relatively limited number of people <br>having reviewed the latest version(s), the reviews have not been as <br>broad as we would like.<br><br><br>/(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from <br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, <br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization?

Thus all references that are only in the appendixes <br>were marked as unused. The authors have manually checked this on the -33 <br>version and found them to be false alarms.
