There is no guidance.<br>In some cases, not mitigating the threat in a consistent manner across implementations means implementing this specification could create security holes in a multi-vendor environment.<br><br>- administrators of different networks need to control policies (and nodes' behaviors) independently of other administrators. Some administrators control only nodes that are part of their own networks, while others apparently must be authorized to control nodes across administrative boundaries. So per-user authorization to access and modify the policy configuration might be required. <br><br>Existing AAA and network management standards might be able to be used to provide access controls. However, to prevent security holes between trust domains, these access controls need to be able to be configured consistently across vendors' equipment and across administrative boundaries.<br><br>- If administrators control nodes across administrative boundaries, there need to be access<br>controls to prevent violating privacy polices, such as making sure the ISP cannot access names<br>and addresses of a customer's employees, or names of customers, or deduce organizational structure.<br><br>- The need to resolve potential conflicts between policies configured by different<br>administrators is mentioned, but specific <br>recommendations for resolving policy conflict is not covered. It is left to the <br>implementation to decide how to resolve the conflicts. If these conflicts are not resolved <br>consistently by different implementations, that could affect interoperability and <br>security trust boundaries. So future work should explicitly address the need for consistent <br>policy resolution to avoid interoperability and security trust boundary issues.<br>Until that future work is done, this document should say what implementers should do in their implementations, and what operators should do in their deployments to prevent this issue from compromising their networks.<br><br>- Integrity checking for messages carrying policies on-the-wire is needed to prevent policy tampering.<br><br>The security directorate review comments in <br> are worth noting.<br>A lot of the text in the email might be adapted into considerations.<br>I reproduce the message text here for the editor's consideration as document text:<br><br>There is a fundamental question of who should be trusted to distribute policy. How is the trust established, and how can the network element be assured that it can established that trust before the network is fully configured? This might be quite difficult, because there could be more than one policy distributor, each with a slightly different view of the network (imagine P1 that can see external networks A and B, and P2 that can see networks B and C). It seems inevitable that a host will have to be able to merge policies and deal with updates. <br>Further, a host might have its own policies to merge into the mix. For example, it might require a DNSSEC capable server for queries about network A, but the policy might specify a non-DNSSEC server for that network. Thus, I can see a need for hosts to communicate their security requirements to the policy server. <br>There are issues about the privacy of the policy itself. Perhaps particular network prefixes reveal business relationships that are confidential. Thus, some policy information might be sent on encrypted channels. <br>What kind of policy enforcement is necessary? If a host violates the multihoming policy and sends a packet with a source address that is appropriate to network A over the path to network B, should the packet be blocked, redirected, or allowed? What about DNS queries that are sent to a server that is not recommended for the target? Quash, redirect, or allow? What information should go back to the host? <br>I think that most of these comments apply to any policy server, and I believe that various IETF documents in the past have attempted to define generic security considerations for them. <br><br><br><br>6) This is an Informational document, why are we using <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> keywords?<br>(i.e., why are we including the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> in the text?)<br>5.3 contains a number of "should" statements.

The new text is apparently written by a non-native-English speaker, and some of the sentences are difficult to parse. Worse, this makes it difficult to interpret the meaning of some sentences to be clear and unambiguous. I recommend the use of active voice to make it clear which actors are expected to perform what actions.

This is a significant improvement from -00-.<br>However, there are still a few threats/considerations that deserve more mention. <br><br>- administrators of different networks seem to <br>need to control policies (and nodes' behaviors) independently of other<br>administrators. The need to have **access controls** for such cross-administrative <br>policy access is not discussed.<br><br>- administrators must control only nodes that are part of their own networks, or some<br>administrators must control only nodes that are part of their own networks, while others<br>are authorized to control nodes across administrative boundaries. So per-user authorization<br>might be required. Existing AAA and network management standards might be able to provide this.<br><br>- If administrators control nodes across administrative boundaries, there need to be access<br>controls to prevent violating privacy polices, such as making sure the ISP cannot access names<br>and addresses of employees, or names of customers, or deduce organizational structure.<br><br>- The need to resolve potential conflicts between policies configured by different<br>administrators is now discussed in -01- Security Consideration. But specific <br>recommendations for resolving policy conflict is not covered. It is left to the <br>implementation to decide how to resolve the conflicts. If they are not resolved <br>consistently by different implementations, that could affect interoperability and <br>security trust boundaries. So future work should explicitly address the need for consistent <br>policy resolution to avoid interoperability and security trust boundary issues.<br><br>- Integrity checking for message carrying policies on-the-wire, to prevent policy tampering.<br><br>The security directorate review comments in <br> are worth noting.<br>A lot of the text in the email might be adapted into considerations.<br>I reproduce the message text here for the editor's consideration as document text:<br><br>There is a fundamental question of who should be trusted to distribute policy. How is the trust established, and how can the network element be assured that it can established that trust before the network is fully configured? This might be quite difficult, because there could be more than one policy distributor, each with a slightly different view of the network (imagine P1 that can see external networks A and B, and P2 that can see networks B and C). It seems inevitable that a host will have to be able to merge policies and deal with updates. <br>Further, a host might have its own policies to merge into the mix. For example, it might require a DNSSEC capable server for queries about network A, but the policy might specify a non-DNSSEC server for that network. Thus, I can see a need for hosts to communicate their security requirements to the policy server. <br>There are issues about the privacy of the policy itself. Perhaps particular network prefixes reveal business relationships that are confidential. Thus, some policy information might be sent on encrypted channels. <br>What kind of policy enforcement is necessary? If a host violates the multihoming policy and sends a packet with a source address that is appropriate to network A over the path to network B, should the packet be blocked, redirected, or allowed? What about DNS queries that are sent to a server that is not recommended for the target? Quash, redirect, or allow? What information should go back to the host? <br>I think that most of these comments apply to any policy server, and I believe that various IETF documents in the past have attempted to define generic security considerations for them. <br><br><br><br>6) This is an Informational document, why are we using <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> keywords?<br>(i.e., why are we including the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> in the text?)<br>5.3 contains a number of "should" statements.

So do we have a solution to one of the key issues raised by this internet-draft???<br><br>From Dave Harrington:<br>s/offering a renaissance/, offering a renaissance/<br>otherwise it appears the "requirement for NAT" offers the renaissance, rather than the "without ... NAT" offering the renaissance. It would be much clearer if this were two sentences. and it could be reworded to be technically much clearer than "renaissance".<br>I agree that an English speaker should go through this document to clarify the English, which uses a lot of phrases and clauses without neccesarily clarifying them by using appropriate punctuation. The RFC Editor will catch many of them, but many of these small changes might impact the representation of WG consensus, and the only real check that the RFC Editor changes are correct happen in AUTH48 by the same authors who didn't write clear text in the first place, presumably because sections were written by editors for whom English is not their native tongue. <br>Acronyms are used without references on first use; for example uRPF<br>in 3.2, scenario 2,<br>"This gateway router would receive prefix delegations from each independent service provider network and a different set of DNS resolvers." This sentence construction makes it unclear whether the "different set of DNS resolvers" means a set for each provider, or a customer DNS resolver that resolves for both networks. The following sentence doesn't really clarify the scenario. This would be clearer if the sentence was structured as "This gateway router would receive prefix delegations and a set of DNS resolvers from each independent service provider network." (which I assume is what you mean to say).<br>It would probabyl be helpful if you actually labeled the DNS provider in the scenario diagram.<br>in the problem statement, scenario 3 bullet 2. Is this a description of a problem? Am I missing what the problem is when "an approrpiate source address will be selected"?<br>in 4.1, it took me a while to understand the point you wanted to make. There is discussion of a developer "being tempted to assume". So I expected the requirement to address the temptation issue, and whether the developer's assumptions were right or wrong. I think this requirement would be clearer if you didn't express it as "tempted to assume", but rather that end-to-end transparency is required so developers **do not need to** work with complex mechanisms to work around&nbsp; e2e impediments, as is common in a NAT'd IPv4 environment.<br>in 4.2, I think the "make nodes behave differently" is too abstract; I think you need some real examples here.<br>4.3 seems to light; are there any industry numbers available that could help to quantify the scale?</div></td>

Has the<br>Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the<br>document and, in particular, does he or she believe this<br>version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?<br><br>The document shepherd is Fred Baker. Yes, I believe that it is ready for IESG consideration.<br><br>(1.b) Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members<br>and from key non-WG members? Does the Document Shepherd have<br>any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that<br>have been performed?<br><br>This document originated from a service provider's statement that it wanted to multi-home all of its residential customers and therefore needed a multihoming solution that addressed specific problems. For the most part, it has served as a focused problem statement for MIF and other working groups. As such, it has been reviewed not only by people in v6ops, but also people in MIF.<br><br>Consistent with v6ops' charter, for a while the authors and chairs were content to let it live as an internet draft and die when the job was done. However, the working group wound up deciding that it captured some important parts of the problem and deserved archival storage. Hence, we're suggesting publication as an RFC.<br><br>(1.c) Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document<br>needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,<br>e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with<br>AAA, internationalization or XML?<br><br>I do not believe that it needs further review. It contains no formal language specifications, makes no specific security recommendations, and adds no new operational issues that have not come up in the shim6 or similar discussions.<br><br>(1.d) Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or<br>issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of?<br><br>No<br><br>(1.e) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with<br>others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and<br>agree with it?<br><br>I believe that the working group generally understands and agrees with the document. I have heard no statements of dissent.<br><br>(1.f) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in<br>separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It<br>should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is<br>entered into the ID Tracker.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(1.g) Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the<br>document satisfies all ID nits?

Boilerplate checks are<br>not enough; this check needs to be thorough. Has the document<br>met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB<br>Doctor, media type and URI type reviews?<br><br>The draft meets all points, with one exception. The current draft of this document was posted on 29 March, and one of the documents it refers to (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mif-dns-server-selection">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mif-dns-server-selection</a>) was reposted (from -01 to -02) on 12 April. That shows as an out of date reference. That can be picked up by the RFC Editor or in the process of addressing an IESG or IETF Last Call comment; I don't see the point of worrying about it just now.<br><br>(1.h) Has the document split its references into normative and<br>informative?<br><br>Yes it has.<br><br>Are there normative references to documents that<br>are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear<br>state? If such normative references exist, what is the<br>strategy for their completion? Are there normative references<br>that are downward references, as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC3967</a>]? If<br>so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure for them [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC3967</a>].<br><br><br><br>(1.i) Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA<br>consideration section exists and is consistent with the body<br>of the document?<br><br>This document has no IANA actions, and says as much.<br><br>(1.j) Has the Document Shepherd verified that sections of the<br>document that are written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc., validate correctly in<br>an automated checker?<br><br>There are no such sections.<br><br>(1.k) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document<br>Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document<br>Announcement Write-Up? Recent examples can be found in the<br>"Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conserving<br>global addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because an<br>IPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source address<br>selection, next-hop resolution and optionally DNS resolution. For<br>IPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of IPv6 NAT. However, NAT<br>should be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent host-to-<br>host connectivity. In this document, we analyze the use cases of<br>multihoming.

The working group requested that it become a working group draft; it was originally posted as <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-v6ops-multihoming-without-nat66/">draft-ietf-v6ops-multihoming-without-nat66</a> in December 2010, and reposted as <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat/">draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-multihoming-without-ipv6nat</a> in March 2011.<br><br>It has in essence been a requirement document feeding into 6MAN and MIF. Related work in those working groups has been proceeding to bring the issues to closure.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>The document describes a network paradigm being used by certain networks in Japan, and describes the issues that prevent them from deployment.
