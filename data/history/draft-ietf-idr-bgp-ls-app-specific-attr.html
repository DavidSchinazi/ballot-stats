I *think* that here,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  B.&nbsp; When the ASLA sub-TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit set,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  then the link attributes for the corresponding ASLA sub-TLV<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MUST be encoded using the respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  per [<a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC7752</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc8571/">RFC8571</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc9104/">RFC9104</a>].<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>the first reference to "ASLA sub-TLV" is the IS-IS flavor, and the second is to the BGP-LS flavor --&nbsp; but please be specific.<br><br>8.

That would imply the sentence could be rewritten as<br><br>&nbsp;  These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the<br>&nbsp;  advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the<br>&nbsp;  IGP nodes.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Which doesn't really help me. :-(<br><br>9. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp;  It is recommended that nodes supporting this specification are<br>&nbsp;  selected as originators of BGP-LS information when advertising the<br>&nbsp;  link-state information from the IGPs.<br><br>Do you mean only such nodes should be selected? Or is it that at least one such should be among those selected? Either is supportable, I think. Whatever the answer, please clarify the text correspondingly. Although, more generally I guess BGP-LS originators ought to support all the extensions in use in a given IGP, not limited to this one, so this is really a special case of a general principle. <br><br>10. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  They would, however, not be able to<br>&nbsp;  support neither the application-specific link attributes nor newer<br>&nbsp;  applications that may be encoded only using the ASLA TLV.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Drop the "not". Also, again this seems like a special case of a general principle -- of course a BGP-LS consumer that doesn't understand a given extension can't do the thing that the extension covers. But, it's fine to remind the reader of this.<br><br>11. In §8,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It is assumed that the IGP instances<br>&nbsp;  originating these TLVs will support all the required security (as<br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8919/">RFC8919</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8920/">RFC8920</a>]) to prevent any security issues<br>&nbsp;  when propagating the TLVs into BGP-LS.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think purporting to "prevent any security issues" is a case of seriously overpromising. A very similar issue existed in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sbfd-extensions-08. Perhaps a similar fix could be applied, although in this case, when I took a quick look at RFCs 8919 and 8920 I didn't find any "required security" of note, so I'm really not sure what if anything is being actually promised by this sentence? Can you help me understand what properties I should be expecting?<br><br>In any case, for the most part it seems fine to say your security model is the same as that of RFCs 8919 and 8920, since as we know BGP-LS tries to be just a re-rendering of the data from those suppliers. But, we should keep in mind this consideration from <a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC 7752</a>:<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, it may be considered that the export of link-state and<br>&nbsp;  TE information as described in this document constitutes a risk to<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality of mission-critical or commercially sensitive<br>&nbsp;  information about the network.&nbsp; <br><br>Might it be worth reminding the reader that if there's any sensitive information contained in the new stuff you're propagating, they should take this warning to heart, since the scope across which the information is being propagated can increase considerably? I don't insist on this, I'm only raising it as a point to consider.<br><br><br>Nits and very minor comments --<br><br>12. The document talks about new this, new that. This probably won't age well -- keep in mind that the RFC this document will become will be around for decades, at which point none of this stuff will be "new". <br><br>It's obviously not a big deal but if it were my document I'd find a way to rewrite those "new" in a way that won't be instantly obsolete.<br><br>13. In §4,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The application-specific attribute<br>&nbsp;  value received via sub-TLVs within the ASLA TLV have preference over<br>&nbsp;  the value received via the top-level TLVs.<br>&nbsp;  <br>There's an agreement in number problem here -- perhaps rewrite as "An application-specific attribute value received via a sub-TLV within the ASLA TLV has precedence over the value received via a top-level TLV"?</div></td>

I don't expect it will be difficult to resolve these, I just want to be sure we have the conversation.<br><br>1. In §4 (2.C),<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  C.&nbsp; The SRLGs advertised in IS-IS SRLG ASLA TLVs and the other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  link attributes advertised in IS-IS ASLA sub-TLVs are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  REQUIRED to be collated, on a per-application basis, for all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  applications that have their bit set in the SABM/UDABM in at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  least one of the aforementioned TLV types.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Is there some reason that there's no need to consider the case where both of the TLV types in question have zero-length application bit masks?<br><br>2. Later in the same paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When performing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  this collation, only the TLVs with the application's bit set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  in SABM/UDABM MUST be used when such TLVs are available from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  either TLV types.<br><br>I suspect you aren't saying what you mean, and the "only... MUST" construct is hard to puzzle out. Do you perhaps mean TLVs that don’t have the application's bit set MUST NOT be used? Because as you've written it, <br><br>- All TLVs with the bit set MUST be collated,<br>- Any TLVs without the bit set MAY be collated (by implication). Which doesn't seem very sensible AFAICT.<br><br>A possible rewrite, if I've understood your intention correctly, might be "When performing this collation, every TLV with the application's bit set in SABM/UDABM MUST be included, when such TLVs are available from either TLV type."<br><br>(Note also a minor fix for agreement in number, s/types/type/ in the last word.)<br><br>3. And still later in the same paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bit for an application is set in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the SABM/UDABM of only one of the TLV types, then the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  attributes from the other TLV type with zero-length<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application bit mask MUST be also collated for that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application, if such TLV is available.<br><br>I'm confused by the reference to a zero-length application bit mask. Can't the other TLV type have a nonzero-length application bit mask, but still have the application bit in question not set within the bit mask?<br><br>I guess probably what you mean is, if the other TLV type is present and has a zero-length application bit mask, since a zero-length SABM/UDABM basically is a wildcard, the equivalent of all bits being set (as I read <a href="/doc/rfc8920/">RFC 8920</a>). <br><br>If that's right, then a change seems in order, along the lines of<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bit for an application is set in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the SABM/UDABM of only one of the TLV types, and if the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  other TLV type has a zero-length application bit mask, then the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  attributes from the other TLV type with zero-length<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application bit mask MUST be also collated for that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application, if such TLV is available.<br><br>I just interpolated the "and" clause. It's a bit wordy and could probably be further condensed, but I think it clarifies sufficiently.<br><br>On the other hand, if I'm not right about this (very possible) then I'd appreciate further discussion on what I got wrong, so we can figure out if the text needs clarification or if I just need a clue bat.<br><br>Previous COMMENT:<br><br>4. In §2 you reference "SABML". I was going to ask you to expand it on first use, but you only use it once. So, please just write it out in words as "SABM Length" and don't introduce an extra acronym.<br><br>5. In §3:<br><br>&nbsp;  All the BGP-LS Attribute TLVs defined in the table above are REQUIRED<br>&nbsp;  to be advertised as a top-level TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute for<br>&nbsp;  carrying link attributes specific to RSVP-TE.<br><br>I suggest “... when used to carry” instead of “... for carrying”. Also, “listed in the table”, not defined in it. <br><br>6. Much of §4 is dedicated to a special case for IS-IS:<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; In the case of IS-IS, the following specific procedures are to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  followed:<br><br>It would be nice to spend a few words mentioning why IS-IS needs a special case and OSPF doesn't, so that the reader doesn't have to wonder. I'm guessing that this relates to the way IS-IS uses sub-TLVs for various things whereas OSPF doesn't, so you need rules to reconcile the values in IS-IS but not OSPF?<br><br>7. §4 (2.B) needs some adjectives, "IS-IS" and "BGP-LS", respectively, to make clear which flavor of "ASLA sub-TLV" you're talking about. I *think* that here,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  B.&nbsp; When the ASLA sub-TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit set,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  then the link attributes for the corresponding ASLA sub-TLV<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MUST be encoded using the respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  per [<a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC7752</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc8571/">RFC8571</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc9104/">RFC9104</a>].<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>the first reference to "ASLA sub-TLV" is the IS-IS flavor, and the second is to the BGP-LS flavor --&nbsp; but please be specific.<br><br>8. In §4, <br><br>&nbsp;  These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the<br>&nbsp;  advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the<br>&nbsp;  IGP nodes that support or do not support the ASLA extension.<br><br>I don't understand this sentence. :-( For one thing, applying simple logic to "IGP nodes that support or do not support the ASLA extension" we can rewrite it as "IGP nodes", full stop, since "support or do not support" covers the entire universe by definition. That would imply the sentence could be rewritten as<br><br>&nbsp;  These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the<br>&nbsp;  advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the<br>&nbsp;  IGP nodes.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Which doesn't really help me. :-(<br><br>9. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp;  It is recommended that nodes supporting this specification are<br>&nbsp;  selected as originators of BGP-LS information when advertising the<br>&nbsp;  link-state information from the IGPs.<br><br>Do you mean only such nodes should be selected? Or is it that at least one such should be among those selected? Either is supportable, I think. Whatever the answer, please clarify the text correspondingly. Although, more generally I guess BGP-LS originators ought to support all the extensions in use in a given IGP, not limited to this one, so this is really a special case of a general principle. <br><br>10. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  They would, however, not be able to<br>&nbsp;  support neither the application-specific link attributes nor newer<br>&nbsp;  applications that may be encoded only using the ASLA TLV.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Drop the "not". Also, again this seems like a special case of a general principle -- of course a BGP-LS consumer that doesn't understand a given extension can't do the thing that the extension covers. But, it's fine to remind the reader of this.<br><br>11. In §8,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It is assumed that the IGP instances<br>&nbsp;  originating these TLVs will support all the required security (as<br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8919/">RFC8919</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8920/">RFC8920</a>]) to prevent any security issues<br>&nbsp;  when propagating the TLVs into BGP-LS.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think purporting to "prevent any security issues" is a case of seriously overpromising.

I don't expect it will be difficult to resolve these, I just want to be sure we have the conversation.<br><br>1. In §4 (2.C),<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  C.&nbsp; The SRLGs advertised in IS-IS SRLG ASLA TLVs and the other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  link attributes advertised in IS-IS ASLA sub-TLVs are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  REQUIRED to be collated, on a per-application basis, for all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  applications that have their bit set in the SABM/UDABM in at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  least one of the aforementioned TLV types.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Is there some reason that there's no need to consider the case where both of the TLV types in question have zero-length application bit masks?<br><br>2. Later in the same paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When performing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  this collation, only the TLVs with the application's bit set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  in SABM/UDABM MUST be used when such TLVs are available from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  either TLV types.<br><br>I suspect you aren't saying what you mean, and the "only... MUST" construct is hard to puzzle out. Do you perhaps mean TLVs that don’t have the application's bit set MUST NOT be used? Because as you've written it, <br><br>- All TLVs with the bit set MUST be collated,<br>- Any TLVs without the bit set MAY be collated (by implication). Which doesn't seem very sensible AFAICT.<br><br>A possible rewrite, if I've understood your intention correctly, might be "When performing this collation, every TLV with the application's bit set in SABM/UDABM MUST be included, when such TLVs are available from either TLV type."<br><br>(Note also a minor fix for agreement in number, s/types/type/ in the last word.)<br><br>3. And still later in the same paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bit for an application is set in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the SABM/UDABM of only one of the TLV types, then the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  attributes from the other TLV type with zero-length<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application bit mask MUST be also collated for that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application, if such TLV is available.<br><br>I'm confused by the reference to a zero-length application bit mask. Can't the other TLV type have a nonzero-length application bit mask, but still have the application bit in question not set within the bit mask?<br><br>I guess probably what you mean is, if the other TLV type is present and has a zero-length application bit mask, since a zero-length SABM/UDABM basically is a wildcard, the equivalent of all bits being set (as I read <a href="/doc/rfc8920/">RFC 8920</a>). <br><br>If that's right, then a change seems in order, along the lines of<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bit for an application is set in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the SABM/UDABM of only one of the TLV types, and if the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  other TLV type has a zero-length application bit mask, then the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  attributes from the other TLV type with zero-length<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application bit mask MUST be also collated for that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  application, if such TLV is available.<br><br>I just interpolated the "and" clause. It's a bit wordy and could probably be further condensed, but I think it clarifies sufficiently.<br><br>On the other hand, if I'm not right about this (very possible) then I'd appreciate further discussion on what I got wrong, so we can figure out if the text needs clarification or if I just need a clue bat.</div></td>

In §2 you reference "SABML". I was going to ask you to expand it on first use, but you only use it once. So, please just write it out in words as "SABM Length" and don't introduce an extra acronym.<br><br>5. In §3:<br><br>&nbsp;  All the BGP-LS Attribute TLVs defined in the table above are REQUIRED<br>&nbsp;  to be advertised as a top-level TLV in the BGP-LS Attribute for<br>&nbsp;  carrying link attributes specific to RSVP-TE.<br><br>I suggest “... when used to carry” instead of “... for carrying”. Also, “listed in the table”, not defined in it. <br><br>6. Much of §4 is dedicated to a special case for IS-IS:<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; In the case of IS-IS, the following specific procedures are to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  followed:<br><br>It would be nice to spend a few words mentioning why IS-IS needs a special case and OSPF doesn't, so that the reader doesn't have to wonder. I'm guessing that this relates to the way IS-IS uses sub-TLVs for various things whereas OSPF doesn't, so you need rules to reconcile the values in IS-IS but not OSPF?<br><br>7. §4 (2.B) needs some adjectives, "IS-IS" and "BGP-LS", respectively, to make clear which flavor of "ASLA sub-TLV" you're talking about. I *think* that here,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  B.&nbsp; When the ASLA sub-TLV has the RSVP-TE application bit set,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  then the link attributes for the corresponding ASLA sub-TLV<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MUST be encoded using the respective BGP-LS top-level TLVs as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  per [<a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC7752</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc8571/">RFC8571</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc9104/">RFC9104</a>].<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>the first reference to "ASLA sub-TLV" is the IS-IS flavor, and the second is to the BGP-LS flavor --&nbsp; but please be specific.<br><br>8. In §4, <br><br>&nbsp;  These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the<br>&nbsp;  advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the<br>&nbsp;  IGP nodes that support or do not support the ASLA extension.<br><br>I don't understand this sentence. :-( For one thing, applying simple logic to "IGP nodes that support or do not support the ASLA extension" we can rewrite it as "IGP nodes", full stop, since "support or do not support" covers the entire universe by definition. That would imply the sentence could be rewritten as<br><br>&nbsp;  These rules ensure that a BGP-LS originator performs the<br>&nbsp;  advertisement for all application-specific link attributes from the<br>&nbsp;  IGP nodes.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Which doesn't really help me. :-(<br><br>9. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp;  It is recommended that nodes supporting this specification are<br>&nbsp;  selected as originators of BGP-LS information when advertising the<br>&nbsp;  link-state information from the IGPs.<br><br>Do you mean only such nodes should be selected? Or is it that at least one such should be among those selected? Either is supportable, I think. Whatever the answer, please clarify the text correspondingly. Although, more generally I guess BGP-LS originators ought to support all the extensions in use in a given IGP, not limited to this one, so this is really a special case of a general principle. <br><br>10. In §5,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  They would, however, not be able to<br>&nbsp;  support neither the application-specific link attributes nor newer<br>&nbsp;  applications that may be encoded only using the ASLA TLV.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Drop the "not". Also, again this seems like a special case of a general principle -- of course a BGP-LS consumer that doesn't understand a given extension can't do the thing that the extension covers. But, it's fine to remind the reader of this.<br><br>11. In §8,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It is assumed that the IGP instances<br>&nbsp;  originating these TLVs will support all the required security (as<br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8919/">RFC8919</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8920/">RFC8920</a>]) to prevent any security issues<br>&nbsp;  when propagating the TLVs into BGP-LS.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think purporting to "prevent any security issues" is a case of seriously overpromising. A very similar issue existed in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sbfd-extensions-08. Perhaps a similar fix could be applied, although in this case, when I took a quick look at RFCs 8919 and 8920 I didn't find any "required security" of note, so I'm really not sure what if anything is being actually promised by this sentence? Can you help me understand what properties I should be expecting?<br><br>In any case, for the most part it seems fine to say your security model is the same as that of RFCs 8919 and 8920, since as we know BGP-LS tries to be just a re-rendering of the data from those suppliers. But, we should keep in mind this consideration from <a href="/doc/rfc7752/">RFC 7752</a>:<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, it may be considered that the export of link-state and<br>&nbsp;  TE information as described in this document constitutes a risk to<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality of mission-critical or commercially sensitive<br>&nbsp;  information about the network.&nbsp; <br><br>Might it be worth reminding the reader that if there's any sensitive information contained in the new stuff you're propagating, they should take this warning to heart, since the scope across which the information is being propagated can increase considerably? I don't insist on this, I'm only raising it as a point to consider.<br><br><br>Nits and very minor comments --<br><br>12. The document talks about new this, new that. This probably won't age well -- keep in mind that the RFC this document will become will be around for decades, at which point none of this stuff will be "new". <br><br>It's obviously not a big deal but if it were my document I'd find a way to rewrite those "new" in a way that won't be instantly obsolete.<br><br>13. In §4,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The application-specific attribute<br>&nbsp;  value received via sub-TLVs within the ASLA TLV have preference over<br>&nbsp;  the value received via the top-level TLVs.<br>&nbsp;  <br>There's an agreement in number problem here -- perhaps rewrite as "An application-specific attribute value received via a sub-TLV within the ASLA TLV has precedence over the value received via a top-level TLV"?</div></td>
