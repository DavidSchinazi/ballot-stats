Releasing Addresses<br><br>Once a block of addresses have been released, can they immediately be allocated to a different client?&nbsp; Or should they avoid being reused straight away if possible?&nbsp; Perhaps this consideration is already covered by DHCPv6, but it probably makes sense to say something about this, either in section 9, and/or maybe in the security considerations.<br><br><br>Nob blocking comments:<br><br>1. Introduction<br> <br>&nbsp;  Typically the new VM instances are assigned a random link-layer (MAC)<br>&nbsp;  address, but that does not scale well due to the birthday paradox.<br><br>Perhaps either have a reference to birthday paradox, or briefly describe (in a sentence) what the paradox is.<br><br>4.3.

Releasing Addresses<br><br>Once a block of addresses have been released, can they immediately be allocated to a different client?&nbsp; Or should they avoid being reused straight away if possible?&nbsp; Perhaps this consideration is already covered by DHCPv6, but it probably makes sense to say something about this, either in section 9, and/or maybe in the security considerations.<br><br><br>No blocking comments:<br><br>1. Introduction<br> <br>&nbsp;  Typically the new VM instances are assigned a random link-layer (MAC)<br>&nbsp;  address, but that does not scale well due to the birthday paradox.<br><br>Perhaps either have a reference to birthday paradox, or briefly describe (in a sentence) what the paradox is.<br><br>4.3. Mechanism Overview<br><br>Contains both:<br><br>&nbsp;  This mechanism can be administratively disabled by the server sending<br>&nbsp;  "infinity" as the T1 and T2 values (see Section 7.7 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>]).<br>&nbsp;  <br>And<br><br>&nbsp;  An administrator may make the address assignment permanent by<br>&nbsp;  specifying use of infinite lifetimes, as defined in Section 7.7 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].<br><br>Perhaps these sentences could be amalgamated?<br><br><br>7.&nbsp; Requesting Addresses<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The client MUST be able to handle a Reply message containing a smaller number of addresses, or an address or addresses different from those requested.<br><br>Perhaps clarify whether the "smaller number of addresses" relates to the initial request from the client, or the value received by the client from the server in teh advertise message.&nbsp; E.g. could a server "advertise" a block of 100 addresses, but then only "reply" with a block of 50 addresses? <br><br><br>8. Renewing Addresses<br><br>IAID is used before it defined.&nbsp; Perhaps either add it to the terminology, or reference where it is defined when it is first used?<br><br>10.1<br>I found the subtle distinction between "IA_LL option" vs "IA_LL-options" to probably be a bit more confusing than necessary.&nbsp; Possibly always refering to the "IA_LL_OPTION option" vs "IA_LL-options field" would add clarify, or perhaps rename "IA_LL-options" to "IA_LL-suboptions".&nbsp; The same comment obviously applies to the LLADDR option definition as well.</div></td>

especially in light of the IOT-Dir review, I do not<br>think that we are attempting to claim that (e.g.) manufacturer-assigned<br>MAC addresses burned in to ethernet chips do not scale, though the text<br>as written implies such a claim.&nbsp; I'm not sure if "randomized" is the<br>best possible qualifier, but may suffice.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  There are several new deployment types that deal with a large number<br>&nbsp;  of devices that need to be initialized.&nbsp; One of them is a scenario<br><br>nit: I'm not sure how well "new deployment types" will age.<br><br>&nbsp;  Typically the new VM instances are assigned a random link-layer (MAC)<br>&nbsp;  address, but that does not scale well due to the birthday paradox.<br><br>I'd suggest giving some example numbers for number-of-VMs and<br>probability of collision.<br><br>&nbsp;  The huge number of such devices would likely exhaust a vendor's OUI<br>&nbsp;  (Organizationally Unique Identifier) global address space, and while<br><br>It's probably worth a reminder of how big that per-vendor space is.<br><br>&nbsp;  avoided inside an administrative domain.&nbsp; For those reasons, it is<br>&nbsp;  desired to have some form of authority that would be able to assign<br>&nbsp;  locally unique MAC addresses.<br><br>I will probably touch on the use of "authority" again later: it seems<br>that at least in some cases the only "authority" involved is "the<br>network has allowed the sending of a DHCPv6 response", which is not<br>always going to actually indicate any level of authority.<br><br>&nbsp;  The IEEE originally set aside half of the 48-bit MAC Address space<br>&nbsp;  for local use (where the U/L bit is set to 1).&nbsp; In 2017, the IEEE<br>&nbsp;  published an optional specification ([IEEEStd802c-2017]) that divides<br>&nbsp;  this space into quadrants (Standards Assigned Identifier, Extended<br>&nbsp;  Local Identifier, Administratively Assigned Identifier, and a<br>&nbsp;  Reserved quadrant) - more details are in Appendix A.<br><br>I suggest clarifying to "further divides this local-use space into<br>quadrants".<br><br>&nbsp;  The IEEE is also working to specify protocols and procedures for<br>&nbsp;  assignment of locally unique addresses (IEEE 802.1cq).&nbsp; This work may<br>&nbsp;  serve as one such protocol for assignment.&nbsp; For additional<br>&nbsp;  background, see [IEEE-802-Tutorial].<br><br>This sounds an awful lot like "IEEE and IETF are working on the same<br>problem".&nbsp; I trust there has been ample liaising and cross-pollination<br>to avoid surprises and duplication of effort.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The DHCP terminology relevant to this specification from [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>]<br>&nbsp;  applies here.<br><br>I suggest a note that what follows is (includes?) additional<br>definitions, since (e.g.) "address block" is not defined in 8415.<br><br>&nbsp;  address block A number of consecutive link-layer addresses.&nbsp; An<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address block is expressed as a first address plus a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  number that designates the number of additional (extra)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addresses/ A single address can be represented by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address itself and zero extra addresses.<br><br>Just to check: there is no requirement for alignment or for the number<br>of extra addresses to be one less than a power of two?<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;

we only talk about "an entity" previously, with no<br>mention of governance.<br><br>&nbsp;  pointing out the cumulative nature of this scenario.&nbsp; Over time, the<br>&nbsp;  hypervisor is likely to increase its address usage.&nbsp; Some obsolete<br>&nbsp;  VMs will be deleted and their addresses will be eligible for reuse<br>&nbsp;  for new VMs.<br><br>Would it be appropriate to say "potentially eligible" or "eventually<br>eligible" to account for the risk of other entities having cached the<br>previous validity of the address(es) in question?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 will send a Request message.&nbsp; The target server will then assign the<br><br>note: the phrase "best server" is not used by <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a>, and the only<br>relevant usage of "best" that I found was in Section 18.2, which refers<br>to the "best configuration available" in a case where only a subset of<br>the requested functionality is available.&nbsp; So I don't think the current<br>quoted text is an adequate reference for the intended behavior.&nbsp; Is it,<br>perhaps, intended to refer to the "Preference" mechanism discussed in<br>Section 18.2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a>?<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients implementing this mechanism SHOULD use the Rapid Commit<br>&nbsp;  option as specified in Section 5.1 and 18.2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].<br><br>I think adding the justification text suggested in response to the<br>INT-dir review would be useful.<br><br>&nbsp;  An administrator may make the address assignment permanent by<br>&nbsp;  specifying use of infinite lifetimes, as defined in Section 7.7 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].<br><br>This feels fairly redundant with the text before Figure 1 about infinite<br>lifetimes.<br><br>&nbsp;  Devices supporting this proposal MAY support the reconfigure<br>&nbsp;  mechanism, as defined in Section 18.2.11 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].&nbsp; If supported<br>&nbsp;  by both server and client, this mechanism allows the administrator to<br>&nbsp;  immediately notify clients that the configuration has changed and<br>&nbsp;  triggers retrieval of relevant changes immediately, rather than after<br>&nbsp;  the T1 timer elapses.&nbsp; Since this mechanism requires implementation<br>&nbsp;  of Reconfigure Key Authentication Protocol (See Section 20.4 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>]), small-footprint devices may choose to not support it.<br><br>nit: I suggest disambiguating "this mechanism" to refer to the<br>reconfigure mechanism, and not the link-layer address assignment<br>mechanism that's the core focus of this document.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  hypervisors, possibly even only one.&nbsp; However, over time the number<br>&nbsp;  of addresses requested by the hypervisor(s) will likely increase as<br>&nbsp;  new VMs are spawned.<br><br>I'm not sure the intent of the "increase over time" here -- if we<br>recycle addresses as VMs are destroyed, then surely the number of<br>addresses allocated to a given hypervisor will saturate at the capacity<br>of that hypervisor?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  requested.&nbsp; The server sends back an Advertise message an IA_LL<br>&nbsp;  option containing an LLADDR option that specifies the addresses being<br>&nbsp;  offered.&nbsp; If the server is unable to provide any addresses it MUST<br>&nbsp;  return the IA_LL option containing a Status Code option (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 21.13 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>]) with status set to NoAddrsAvail.<br><br>This is an interesting statement, as it could be read as trying to<br>require *all* servers (even those that don't implement this document) to<br>return IA_LL+NoAddrsAvail in this case, not just servers that implement<br>this document.<br><br>&nbsp;  The client MUST be able to handle an Advertise message containing a<br>&nbsp;  smaller number of addresses, or an address or addresses different<br>&nbsp;  from those requested.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  The client MUST be able to handle a Reply message containing a<br>&nbsp;  smaller number of addresses, or an address or addresses different<br>&nbsp;  from those requested.<br><br>In some sense it seems like this generic class of behavior should be<br>part of 8415 and "not need to be repeated here" (though, to be clear, I<br>am happy to see these statements and would like them to remain).<br>I would also suggest to note that (e.g.) "the client MUST NOT use<br>addresses included in an Advertise message but not confirmed in a Reply<br>for link-layer traffic" and "the client MAY use such addresses in<br>deciding what server to use" and/or "the client MAY discard such an<br>allocation and re-send a request to a different server as a result.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  If the requesting client needs additional addresses -- e.g., in the<br>&nbsp;  hypervisor scenario because addresses need to be assigned to new VMs<br>&nbsp;  -- the simpler approach is for the requesting device to keep the<br>&nbsp;  address blocks as atomic once "leased".&nbsp; Therefore, if a client wants<br>&nbsp;  more addresses at a later stage, it SHOULD send an IA_LL option with<br>&nbsp;  a different IAID to create another "container" for more addresses.<br><br>side note: I guess I'm not sure what the client would do other than the<br>behavior recommended by the "SHOULD" -- other than "give up and be sad",<br>it seems like the only other choice would be to send an IA_LL with the<br>same IAID, which seems unlikely to work.&nbsp; This is a side note because I<br>don't think there's a useful change to make to the text; I'm mostly just<br>curious.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the client is unable to Renew before the T2 timer elapses, it<br>&nbsp;  starts sending Rebind messages as described in 18.2.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].<br><br>nit: this reference lacks a "Section" and is not htmlized into a<br>section-link.&nbsp; I mostly expect that in the v2--&gt;v3 conversion the RFC<br>Editor will make it DTRT, if you want to just leave it to them.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  The client may decide to release a leased address block.&nbsp; A client<br>&nbsp;  MUST release the whole block in its entirety.&nbsp; A client releases an<br>&nbsp;  address block by sending a Release message that includes the IA_LL<br><br>nit: I think this is more correct as "an IA_LL option" (but the<br>following "the LLADDR option", not quoted, is okay as-is).<br><br>Section 10<br><br>&nbsp;  This mechanism uses an approach similar to the existing mechanisms in<br>&nbsp;  DHCP.&nbsp; There is one container option (the IA_LL option) that contains<br>&nbsp;  the actual address or addresses, represented by an LLADDR option.<br>&nbsp;  Each such option represents an address block, which is expressed as a<br>&nbsp;  first address with a number that specifies how many additional<br>&nbsp;  addresses are included.<br><br>Is the "each such option" each LLADDR option or each IA_LL option?<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  client's IA_LLs.&nbsp; The number space for IA_LL IAIDs is<br><br>To check my understanding: "this client" is identified by the DUID here,<br>right?&nbsp; (No need to change the text, I think, if that's correct.)<br><br>&nbsp;  T1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The time at which the client should contact the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Either way, should a device be able to ask for 00:00:00:00:00:01 and 2^48-2 addresses? The document does say things like: "In particular, the server may send a different starting address than requested, or grant a smaller number of addresses than requested.", but it might be nice to also include something like "implementations should allow configuration of the maximum number of addresses to allocate" or something similar (yes, an attacker could keep coming back and looking like a new device, but...)</div></td>
