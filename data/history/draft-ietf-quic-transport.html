It's really exciting to see what we can do with a<br>nearly clear slate and the accumulated modern knowledge about protocol<br>design.&nbsp; Congratulations and thanks to all who contributed!<br>Special thanks (in advance) to the chairs for helping translate my<br>comments into github issues.<br><br>I have some editorial suggestions that I put up at<br><a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/4597">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/4597</a> .<br><br>Abstract, Section 1<br><br>My understanding is that "exemplary" typically is used to refer to not<br>just any example of the topic in question, but to one that is the<br>pinnacle of achievement or the best of its kind.&nbsp; Do we intend to make<br>such a claim about the congestion control algorithm in [QUIC-RECOVERY]?<br><br>Section 1.3<br><br>&gt; x (E) ...:&nbsp; Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times (and that<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; each instance is length E)<br><br>Does "repeated zero or more times" mean that there is zero or more<br>instances in total, or one or more instances in total?&nbsp; (I assume the<br>latter, and would suggest additional wording if the former is what was<br>intended.)&nbsp; I am specifically curious about the application to the Ack<br>Range field of the ACK Frame, since it seems like early on in a<br>connection it is not always possible to construct a valid Gap field, but<br>will not duplicate the question there.<br><br>Section 2.4<br><br>&gt; *&nbsp; write data, understanding when stream flow control credit<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Section 4.1) has successfully been reserved to send the written<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; data;<br><br>(side note) I note that "flow control credit has been reserved" is<br>different than "has been ACKd by the peer".&nbsp; I guess the expectation is<br>that if such information is needed, an application-layer ACK should be<br>used, since QUIC ACKs can be sent before the peer application has<br>consumed the received data?<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>I'm not sure why "Peer Creates Bidirectional Stream" appears on two<br>transitions in the figure.&nbsp; The prose suggests that the copy on the<br>Ready-&gt;Send transition is erroneous.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&gt; QUIC employs a limit-based flow-control scheme where a receiver<br>&gt; advertises the limit of total bytes it is prepared to receive on a<br>&gt; given stream or for the entire connection.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Should I be reading some distinction into "limit-based" (here) vs<br>"credit-based" (earlier) flow control?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&gt; When a sender receives credit after being blocked, it might be able<br>&gt; to send a large amount of data in response, resulting in short-term<br>&gt; congestion; see Section 6.9 in [QUIC-RECOVERY] for a discussion of<br>&gt; how a sender can avoid this congestion.<br><br>No such section exists in the -33; perhaps §7.7 is intended?<br><br>Section 5.1.1<br><br>&gt; An endpoint SHOULD ensure that its peer has a sufficient number of<br>&gt; available and unused connection IDs.&nbsp; Endpoints advertise the number<br>&gt; of active connection IDs they are willing to maintain using the<br>&gt; active_connection_id_limit transport parameter.&nbsp; An endpoint MUST NOT<br>&gt; provide more connection IDs than the peer's limit.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>IIUC, the reason that a negotiated limit is needed here is not exactly<br>for the storage of the connection ID values themselves (though the<br>requirement to explicitly use RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID makes it not as<br>simple as it might be), but rather due to the requirement to recognize<br>the associated stateless reset tokens.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, perhaps<br>it could be mentioned as a factor, here.<br><br>Section 5.2.2<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Servers SHOULD respond with a Version<br>&gt; Negotiation packet, provided that the datagram is sufficiently long.<br><br>This SHOULD seems redundant with the first sentence of the section?<br><br>&gt; Packets with a supported version, or no version field, are matched to<br>&gt; a connection using the connection ID or - for packets with zero-<br>&gt; length connection IDs - the local address and port.&nbsp; These packets<br>&gt; are processed using the selected connection; otherwise, the server<br>&gt; continues below.<br><br>(side note) Packets with a short header do not indicate the connection<br>ID length (or version).&nbsp; I think we admit the possibility that a server<br>could advertise a zero-length connection ID to some but not all clients;<br>does that imply that a lookup by address/port in the local connection<br>database would be needed to determine whether such a short-header packet<br>would have a zero-length connection ID or not?<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A client MUST discard any<br>&gt; Version Negotiation packet if it has received and successfully<br>&gt; processed any other packet, including an earlier Version Negotiation<br>&gt; packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It seems like this requirement might be too strict, in that it could<br>prevent otherwise successful communication when a limited on-path<br>attacker injects a Version Negotiation packet.<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&gt; When an Initial packet is sent by a client that has not previously<br>&gt; received an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the client<br>&gt; populates the Destination Connection ID field with an unpredictable<br>&gt; value.&nbsp; This Destination Connection ID MUST be at least 8 bytes in<br>&gt; length.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>My usual policy on seeing a random nonce shorter than 128 bits is to ask<br>for explanation of why the shorter value is safe for the use it is being<br>put to.&nbsp; (How bad would it be to bump this to 16?)<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once a client<br>&gt; has received a valid Initial packet from the server, it MUST discard<br>&gt; any subsequent packet it receives with a different Source Connection<br>&gt; ID.<br><br>This seems over-zealous as written, since it would seem to prevent the<br>server from ever using a new Source Connection ID on that connection,<br>even in response to a client migration event.&nbsp; Is it intended to be<br>scoped to just Initial (and Handshake?) packets as is done for the<br>server in the following paragraph?<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Application protocols can recommend values for<br>&gt; transport parameters, such as the initial flow control limits.<br>&gt; However, application protocols that set constraints on values for<br>&gt; transport parameters could make it impossible for a client to offer<br>&gt; multiple application protocols if these constraints conflict.<br><br>Should we go a step further and forbid application protocols from making<br>such requirements?<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>&gt; Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all<br>&gt; data in a CRYPTO frame, it MAY discard that CRYPTO frame and all<br>&gt; CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it MAY close the connection<br>&gt; with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>How future-proof is this?&nbsp; NewSessionTicket is "safe" to discard in that<br>doing so has no negative consequences for the current connection (it may<br>indicate that previously received tickets have been invalidated, but<br>that is also fairly benign and can happen for other reasons), but in<br>general post-handshake CRYPTO frames are not constrained in what TLS<br>messages they can carry, including any TLS messages defined in the<br>future.&nbsp; I am not sure that we can effectively require all future TLS<br>post-handshake messages to be safe to discard.<br><br>Section 8.1.3<br><br>&gt; Clients that want to break continuity of identity with a server MAY<br>&gt; discard tokens provided using the NEW_TOKEN frame.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems more like a SHOULD than a MAY, given the precondition.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A server SHOULD<br>&gt; encode tokens provided with NEW_TOKEN frames and Retry packets<br>&gt; differently, and validate the latter more strictly.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Didn't we already have a MUST-level requirement for being able to tell<br>them apart, in §8.1.1?<br><br>Section 8.1.4<br><br>&gt; An address validation token MUST be difficult to guess.&nbsp; Including a<br>&gt; large enough random value in the token would be sufficient, but this<br>&gt; depends on the server remembering the value it sends to clients.<br><br>(How large is "large enough?")<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>&gt; Path validation is used by both peers during connection migration<br>&gt; (see Section 9) to verify reachability after a change of address.&nbsp; In<br>&gt; path validation, endpoints test reachability between a specific local<br>&gt; address and a specific peer address, where an address is the two-<br>&gt; tuple of IP address and port.<br><br>In light of the toplevel definition of "address" in this document, the<br>last clause seems unnecessary.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&gt; The design of QUIC relies on endpoints retaining a stable address for<br>&gt; the duration of the handshake.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Why do we allow PATH_CHALLENGE (and the impossible PATH_RESPONSE) to be<br>sent in 0-RTT frames, then?&nbsp; (This might dupe a comment later...)<br><br>Section 9.5<br><br>&gt; Similarly, an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending to<br>&gt; more than one destination address.&nbsp; Due to network changes outside<br>&gt; the control of its peer, an endpoint might receive packets from a new<br>&gt; source address with the same destination connection ID, in which case<br>&gt; it MAY continue to use the current connection ID with the new remote<br>&gt; address while still sending from the same local address.<br><br>The MAY seems like it may be in conflict with the MUST.<br><br>Section 10.2.1<br><br>&gt; An endpoint's selected connection ID and the QUIC version are<br>&gt; sufficient information to identify packets for a closing connection;<br>&gt; the endpoint MAY discard all other connection state.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Are the packet protection keys for outgoing traffic (or the literal<br>CONNECTION_CLOSE packet contents) not considered part of "connection<br>state"?<br><br>Section 10.3<br><br>Just to check my understanding: it is "safe" for a server to decide that<br>it will never use stateless reset and send random values in the<br>stateless_reset_token fields that it immediately forgets?&nbsp; (It would<br>then not be able to ever send stateless reset, of course, but AFAICT<br>that is the only consequence.&nbsp; The client still has to track the<br>relevant state, and the server has to track<br>per-connection-ID-sequence-number state.)&nbsp; I don't know if that's worth<br>mentioning, since the field is otherwise essentially mandatory when<br>server connection IDs are in use.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An<br>&gt; endpoint that sends a stateless reset in response to a packet that is<br>&gt; 43 bytes or shorter SHOULD send a stateless reset that is one byte<br>&gt; shorter than the packet it responds to.<br><br>(side note) We haven't gotten to the anti-looping stuff in §10.3.3 yet,<br>so the "one byte shorter" is a bit out of the blue until we get there.<br><br>Section 10.3.2<br><br>I'm not sure whether it should be here or earlier, but somewhere we<br>should motivate this construction as being something that can be<br>generated statelessly, e.g., by a server restarting after a crash, based<br>only on attributes (e.g., Connection ID) of a received packet from a<br>previous connection.&nbsp; The value is computed in advance and given to the<br>peer so that the peer will know what to expect if the stateless reset<br>functionality needs to be used, and then generated at runtime by an<br>endpoint that has lost state.&nbsp; The scheme described in the first<br>paragraph requires state, and thus is hard to justify describing as a<br>stateless reset...<br><br>&gt; A single static key can be used across all connections to the same<br>&gt; endpoint by generating the proof using a second iteration of a<br>&gt; preimage-resistant function that takes a static key and the<br>&gt; connection ID chosen by the endpoint (see Section 5.1) as input.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>The phrase "second iteration" doesn't seem to be explained at all.<br><br>&gt; This design relies on the peer always sending a connection ID in its<br>&gt; packets so that the endpoint can use the connection ID from a packet<br>&gt; to reset the connection.&nbsp; An endpoint that uses this design MUST<br>&gt; either use the same connection ID length for all connections or<br>&gt; encode the length of the connection ID such that it can be recovered<br>&gt; without state.&nbsp; In addition, it cannot provide a zero-length<br>&gt; connection ID.<br><br>(There is a corollary that the length of the connection ID has to be<br>enough so that multiple connection IDs can be issued to all potential<br>peers cumulatively over the lifetime of the static key, though perhaps<br>it's sufficiently obvious so as to go without saying.)<br><br>Section 12.4<br><br>A forward-reference to §19.21 for how extension frames can be used might<br>be useful.<br><br>Why are PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE allowed in the 0-RTT packet number<br>space?&nbsp; (Hmm, the prose and table may be inconsistent here, too.&nbsp; I<br>touch some things in my PR but I think not all of them.)&nbsp; The server<br>isn't allowed to send at that level, so it seems that even if a client<br>did sent PATH_CHALLENGE in 0-RTT, the PATH_RESPONSE would have to come<br>back in 1-RTT.&nbsp; (And with no challenge to reply to, the client can't<br>very well send a PATH_RESPONSE in 0-RTT.)&nbsp; Also, IIRC, we state<br>elsewhere that we require a stable path for the duration of the<br>handshake.&nbsp; Even preferred-address probing can't occur until the client<br>has the server's transport parameters, which aren't usable until 1-RTT<br>keys are available (even if they may technically be available prior to<br>then).<br><br>Section 13.2.3<br><br>&gt;

I<br>didn't see one in [QUIC-RECOVERY] on a quick search, but haven't read it<br>in depth yet.<br>(TCP RACK used roughly "X is out of order when X has lower sequence<br>number than Y and X is received after Y is received", which is what I'll<br>use as a mental model until I read otherwise.)<br><br>Section 13.2.5<br><br>&gt; When the measured acknowledgement delay is larger than its<br>&gt; max_ack_delay, an endpoint SHOULD report the measured delay.&nbsp; This<br>&gt; information is especially useful during the handshake when delays<br>&gt; might be large; see Section 13.2.1.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand when this delay would not be reported even in<br>the absence of this guidance.&nbsp; Is the idea that you should specifically<br>send an ACK with Largest Acknowledged corresponding to the highly<br>delayed packet, even if you could send an ACK with a larger Largest<br>Acknowledged (but lower delay)?<br><br>Section 17<br><br>(side note) I don't know that it would be of particular benefit to have<br>it explained in the document, but I do find myself curious why there is<br>a Fixed Bit.<br><br>Section 17.2.5<br><br>Should we give some guidance on the (minimum) length of the Retry Token<br>(possibly in a subsection)?&nbsp;

The Source and Destination Connection ID fields are the primary means<br>&gt; of protection against off-path attack during the handshake.&nbsp; These<br><br>Presumably we should then give some guidance on how to generate the<br>Connection IDs so that they can fulfill this role effectively.&nbsp; Though it<br>is likely to change significantly as a result of IETF Review,<br><a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> may have some useful advice<br>here.&nbsp; In particular, it seems like they actually do need to be<br>unpredictable in order to fulfill this role, and very short Connection<br>IDs will not be very effective either.<br><br>Section 21.3<br><br>&gt; Servers SHOULD provide mitigations for this attack by limiting the<br>&gt; usage and lifetime of address validation tokens; see Section 8.1.3.<br><br>I recognize that it is probably an advanced implementation feature to do<br>so, but implementations can also mitigate by detecting elevated rates<br>across all connections or some identifiable cateogry of connections, of<br>sending responses to 0-RTT data that are declared lost, treating that as<br>indication of an ongoing attack, and racheting down the congestion<br>window it uses for such data for the duration of the attack.&nbsp; This in<br>theory could improve the stability of the Internet as a whole, which<br>would be the motivation for mentioning it in this document as opposed to<br>leaving it at the discretion of implementors.<br><br>Section 21.5<br><br>&gt; For example, cross-site request forgery [CSRF] exploits on the Web<br>&gt; cause a client to issue requests that include authorization cookies<br>&gt; [COOKIE], allowing one site access to information and actions that<br>&gt;

Clients however are not obligated to use the NEW_TOKEN frame.<br>&gt; Request forgery attacks that rely on the Token field can be avoided<br>&gt; if clients send an empty Token field when the server address has<br>&gt; changed from when the NEW_TOKEN frame was received.<br><br>&gt; Clients could avoid using NEW_TOKEN if the server address changes.<br>&gt; However, not including a Token field could adversely affect<br>&gt; performance.&nbsp; Servers could rely on NEW_TOKEN to enable sending of<br>&gt; data in excess of the three times limit on sending data; see<br>&gt; Section 8.1.&nbsp; In particular, this affects cases where clients use<br>&gt; 0-RTT to request data from servers.<br><br>This seems to be setting us up to specifically recommend trading away<br>security in favor of performance.&nbsp; Is that the right tradeoff?<br>(Also, in the vein of my earlier comment, advanced implementation<br>strategies involving detecting the presence of an attack might provide<br>global benefit to the Internet, though the case is a bit weaker here<br>than it was in the other situation.)<br><br>Section 21.10<br><br>&gt;

Do we intend to make<br>such a claim about the congestion control algorithm in [QUIC-RECOVERY]?<br><br>Section 1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  x (E) ...:&nbsp; Indicates that x is repeated zero or more times (and that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each instance is length E)<br><br>Does "repeated zero or more times" mean that there is zero or more<br>instances in total, or one or more instances in total?&nbsp; (I assume the<br>latter, and would suggest additional wording if the former is what was<br>intended.)&nbsp; I am specifically curious about the application to the Ack<br>Range field of the ACK Frame, since it seems like early on in a<br>connection it is not always possible to construct a valid Gap field, but<br>will not duplicate the question there.<br><br>Section 2.4<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; write data, understanding when stream flow control credit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Section 4.1) has successfully been reserved to send the written<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data;<br><br>(side note) I note that "flow control credit has been reserved" is<br>different than "has been ACKd by the peer".&nbsp; I guess the expectation is<br>that if such information is needed, an application-layer ACK should be<br>used, since QUIC ACKs can be sent before the peer application has<br>consumed the received data?<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>I'm not sure why "Peer Creates Bidirectional Stream" appears on two<br>transitions in the figure.&nbsp; The prose suggests that the copy on the<br>Ready-&gt;Send transition is erroneous.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC employs a limit-based flow-control scheme where a receiver<br>&nbsp;  advertises the limit of total bytes it is prepared to receive on a<br>&nbsp;  given stream or for the entire connection.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Should I be reading some distinction into "limit-based" (here) vs<br>"credit-based" (earlier) flow control?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  When a sender receives credit after being blocked, it might be able<br>&nbsp;  to send a large amount of data in response, resulting in short-term<br>&nbsp;  congestion; see Section 6.9 in [QUIC-RECOVERY] for a discussion of<br>&nbsp;  how a sender can avoid this congestion.<br><br>No such section exists in the -33; perhaps §7.7 is intended?<br><br>Section 5.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint SHOULD ensure that its peer has a sufficient number of<br>&nbsp;  available and unused connection IDs.&nbsp; Endpoints advertise the number<br>&nbsp;  of active connection IDs they are willing to maintain using the<br>&nbsp;  active_connection_id_limit transport parameter.&nbsp; An endpoint MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  provide more connection IDs than the peer's limit.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>IIUC, the reason that a negotiated limit is needed here is not exactly<br>for the storage of the connection ID values themselves (though the<br>requirement to explicitly use RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID makes it not as<br>simple as it might be), but rather due to the requirement to recognize<br>the associated stateless reset tokens.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, perhaps<br>it could be mentioned as a factor, here.<br><br>Section 5.2.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Servers SHOULD respond with a Version<br>&nbsp;  Negotiation packet, provided that the datagram is sufficiently long.<br><br>This SHOULD seems redundant with the first sentence of the section?<br><br>&nbsp;  Packets with a supported version, or no version field, are matched to<br>&nbsp;  a connection using the connection ID or - for packets with zero-<br>&nbsp;  length connection IDs - the local address and port.&nbsp; These packets<br>&nbsp;  are processed using the selected connection; otherwise, the server<br>&nbsp;  continues below.<br><br>(side note) Packets with a short header do not indicate the connection<br>ID length (or version).&nbsp; I think we admit the possibility that a server<br>could advertise a zero-length connection ID to some but not all clients;<br>does that imply that a lookup by address/port in the local connection<br>database would be needed to determine whether such a short-header packet<br>would have a zero-length connection ID or not?<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;

 processed any other packet, including an earlier Version Negotiation<br>&nbsp;  packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It seems like this requirement might be too strict, in that it could<br>prevent otherwise successful communication when a limited on-path<br>attacker injects a Version Negotiation packet.<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  When an Initial packet is sent by a client that has not previously<br>&nbsp;  received an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the client<br>&nbsp;  populates the Destination Connection ID field with an unpredictable<br>&nbsp;  value.&nbsp; This Destination Connection ID MUST be at least 8 bytes in<br>&nbsp;  length.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>My usual policy on seeing a random nonce shorter than 128 bits is to ask<br>for explanation of why the shorter value is safe for the use it is being<br>put to.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once a client<br>&nbsp;  has received a valid Initial packet from the server, it MUST discard<br>&nbsp;  any subsequent packet it receives with a different Source Connection<br>&nbsp;  ID.<br><br>This seems over-zealous as written, since it would seem to prevent the<br>server from ever using a new Source Connection ID on that connection,<br>even in response to a client migration event.&nbsp; Is it intended to be<br>scoped to just Initial (and Handshake?) packets as is done for the<br>server in the following paragraph?<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Application protocols can recommend values for<br>&nbsp;  transport parameters, such as the initial flow control limits.<br>&nbsp;  However, application protocols that set constraints on values for<br>&nbsp;  transport parameters could make it impossible for a client to offer<br>&nbsp;  multiple application protocols if these constraints conflict.<br><br>Should we go a step further and forbid application protocols from making<br>such requirements?<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all<br>&nbsp;  data in a CRYPTO frame, it MAY discard that CRYPTO frame and all<br>&nbsp;  CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it MAY close the connection<br>&nbsp;  with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>How future-proof is this?&nbsp; NewSessionTicket is "safe" to discard in that<br>doing so has no negative consequences for the current connection (it may<br>indicate that previously received tickets have been invalidated, but<br>that is also fairly benign and can happen for other reasons), but in<br>general post-handshake CRYPTO frames are not constrained in what TLS<br>messages they can carry, including any TLS messages defined in the<br>future.&nbsp; I am not sure that we can effectively require all future TLS<br>post-handshake messages to be safe to discard.<br><br>Section 8.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients that want to break continuity of identity with a server MAY<br>&nbsp;  discard tokens provided using the NEW_TOKEN frame.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems more like a SHOULD than a MAY, given the precondition.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  encode tokens provided with NEW_TOKEN frames and Retry packets<br>&nbsp;  differently, and validate the latter more strictly.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Didn't we already have a MUST-level requirement for being able to tell<br>them apart, in §8.1.1?<br><br>Section 8.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  An address validation token MUST be difficult to guess.&nbsp; Including a<br>&nbsp;  large enough random value in the token would be sufficient, but this<br>&nbsp;  depends on the server remembering the value it sends to clients.<br><br>(How large is "large enough?")<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Path validation is used by both peers during connection migration<br>&nbsp;  (see Section 9) to verify reachability after a change of address.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  path validation, endpoints test reachability between a specific local<br>&nbsp;  address and a specific peer address, where an address is the two-<br>&nbsp;  tuple of IP address and port.<br><br>In light of the toplevel definition of "address" in this document, the<br>last clause seems unnecessary.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  The design of QUIC relies on endpoints retaining a stable address for<br>&nbsp;  the duration of the handshake.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Why do we allow PATH_CHALLENGE (and the impossible PATH_RESPONSE) to be<br>sent in 0-RTT frames, then?&nbsp; (This might dupe a comment later...)<br><br>Section 9.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Similarly, an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending to<br>&nbsp;  more than one destination address.&nbsp; Due to network changes outside<br>&nbsp;  the control of its peer, an endpoint might receive packets from a new<br>&nbsp;  source address with the same destination connection ID, in which case<br>&nbsp;  it MAY continue to use the current connection ID with the new remote<br>&nbsp;  address while still sending from the same local address.<br><br>The MAY seems like it may be in conflict with the MUST.<br><br>Section 10.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint's selected connection ID and the QUIC version are<br>&nbsp;  sufficient information to identify packets for a closing connection;<br>&nbsp;  the endpoint MAY discard all other connection state.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Are the packet protection keys for outgoing traffic (or the literal<br>CONNECTION_CLOSE packet contents) not considered part of "connection<br>state"?<br><br>Section 10.3<br><br>Just to check my understanding: it is "safe" for a server to decide that<br>it will never use stateless reset and send random values in the<br>stateless_reset_token fields that it immediately forgets?&nbsp; (It would<br>then not be able to ever send stateless reset, of course, but AFAICT<br>that is the only consequence.&nbsp; The client still has to track the<br>relevant state, and the server has to track<br>per-connection-ID-sequence-number state.)&nbsp; I don't know if that's worth<br>mentioning, since the field is otherwise essentially mandatory when<br>server connection IDs are in use.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An<br>&nbsp;  endpoint that sends a stateless reset in response to a packet that is<br>&nbsp;  43 bytes or shorter SHOULD send a stateless reset that is one byte<br>&nbsp;  shorter than the packet it responds to.<br><br>(side note) We haven't gotten to the anti-looping stuff in §10.3.3 yet,<br>so the "one byte shorter" is a bit out of the blue until we get there.<br><br>Section 10.3.2<br><br>I'm not sure whether it should be here or earlier, but somewhere we<br>should motivate this construction as being something that can be<br>generated statelessly, e.g., by a server restarting after a crash, based<br>only on attributes (e.g., Connection ID) of a received packet from a<br>previous connection.&nbsp; The value is computed in advance and given to the<br>peer so that the peer will know what to expect if the stateless reset<br>functionality needs to be used, and then generated at runtime by an<br>endpoint that has lost state.&nbsp; The scheme described in the first<br>paragraph requires state, and thus is hard to justify describing as a<br>stateless reset...<br><br>&nbsp;  A single static key can be used across all connections to the same<br>&nbsp;  endpoint by generating the proof using a second iteration of a<br>&nbsp;  preimage-resistant function that takes a static key and the<br>&nbsp;  connection ID chosen by the endpoint (see Section 5.1) as input.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>The phrase "second iteration" doesn't seem to be explained at all.<br><br>&nbsp;  This design relies on the peer always sending a connection ID in its<br>&nbsp;  packets so that the endpoint can use the connection ID from a packet<br>&nbsp;  to reset the connection.&nbsp; An endpoint that uses this design MUST<br>&nbsp;  either use the same connection ID length for all connections or<br>&nbsp;  encode the length of the connection ID such that it can be recovered<br>&nbsp;  without state.&nbsp; In addition, it cannot provide a zero-length<br>&nbsp;  connection ID.<br><br>(There is a corollary that the length of the connection ID has to be<br>enough so that multiple connection IDs can be issued to all potential<br>peers cumulatively over the lifetime of the static key, though perhaps<br>it's sufficiently obvious so as to go without saying.)<br><br>Section 12.4<br><br>A forward-reference to §19.21 for how extension frames can be used might<br>be useful.<br><br>Why are PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE allowed in the 0-RTT packet number<br>space?&nbsp; (Hmm, the prose and table may be inconsistent here, too.&nbsp; I<br>touch some things in my PR but I think not all of them.)&nbsp; The server<br>isn't allowed to send at that level, so it seems that even if a client<br>did sent PATH_CHALLENGE in 0-RTT, the PATH_RESPONSE would have to come<br>back in 1-RTT.&nbsp; (And with no challenge to reply to, the client can't<br>very well send a PATH_RESPONSE in 0-RTT.)&nbsp; Also, IIRC, we state<br>elsewhere that we require a stable path for the duration of the<br>handshake.&nbsp; Even preferred-address probing can't occur until the client<br>has the server's transport parameters, which aren't usable until 1-RTT<br>keys are available (even if they may technically be available prior to<br>then).<br><br>Section 13.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  ACK frames SHOULD always acknowledge the most recently received<br>&nbsp;  packets, and the more out-of-order the packets are, the more<br>&nbsp;  important it is to send an updated ACK frame quickly, [...]<br><br>Do we have a strict definition of "out of order" that we adhere to?&nbsp; I<br>didn't see one in [QUIC-RECOVERY] on a quick search, but haven't read it<br>in depth yet.<br>(TCP RACK used roughly "X is out of order when X has lower sequence<br>number than Y and X is received after Y is received", which is what I'll<br>use as a mental model until I read otherwise.)<br><br>Section 13.2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  When the measured acknowledgement delay is larger than its<br>&nbsp;  max_ack_delay, an endpoint SHOULD report the measured delay.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  information is especially useful during the handshake when delays<br>&nbsp;  might be large; see Section 13.2.1.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand when this delay would not be reported even in<br>the absence of this guidance.&nbsp; Is the idea that you should specifically<br>send an ACK with Largest Acknowledged corresponding to the highly<br>delayed packet, even if you could send an ACK with a larger Largest<br>Acknowledged (but lower delay)?<br><br>Section 17<br><br>(side note) I don't know that it would be of particular benefit to have<br>it explained in the document, but I do find myself curious why there is<br>a Fixed Bit.<br><br>Section 17.2.5<br><br>Should we give some guidance on the (minimum) length of the Retry Token<br>(possibly in a subsection)?&nbsp;

A server MUST NOT send more than one Retry<br>&nbsp;  packet in response to a single UDP datagram.<br><br>When the server sends multiple Retry packets in such a scenario, do the<br>Source Connection ID fields need to be different (or the same) across<br>all of them?&nbsp;

In particular, it seems like they actually do need to be<br>unpredictable in order to fulfill this role, and very short Connection<br>IDs will not be very effective either.<br><br>Section 21.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Servers SHOULD provide mitigations for this attack by limiting the<br>&nbsp;  usage and lifetime of address validation tokens; see Section 8.1.3.<br><br>I recognize that it is probably an advanced implementation feature to do<br>so, but implementations can also mitigate by detecting elevated rates<br>across all connections or some identifiable cateogry of connections, of<br>sending responses to 0-RTT data that are declared lost, treating that as<br>indication of an ongoing attack, and racheting down the congestion<br>window it uses for such data for the duration of the attack.&nbsp; This in<br>theory could improve the stability of the Internet as a whole, which<br>would be the motivation for mentioning it in this document as opposed to<br>leaving it at the discretion of implementors.<br><br>Section 21.5<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, cross-site request forgery [CSRF] exploits on the Web<br>&nbsp;  cause a client to issue requests that include authorization cookies<br>&nbsp;  [COOKIE], allowing one site access to information and actions that<br>&nbsp;  are intended to be restricted to a different site.<br><br>Server-side request forgery is also a powerful example of this type of<br>attack.&nbsp; Though it's not really clear that we need more than one example<br>here, so "no change" is okay with me.<br><br>Section 21.5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients however are not obligated to use the NEW_TOKEN frame.<br>&nbsp;  Request forgery attacks that rely on the Token field can be avoided<br>&nbsp;  if clients send an empty Token field when the server address has<br>&nbsp;  changed from when the NEW_TOKEN frame was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients could avoid using NEW_TOKEN if the server address changes.<br>&nbsp;  However, not including a Token field could adversely affect<br>&nbsp;  performance.&nbsp; Servers could rely on NEW_TOKEN to enable sending of<br>&nbsp;  data in excess of the three times limit on sending data; see<br>&nbsp;  Section 8.1.&nbsp; In particular, this affects cases where clients use<br>&nbsp;  0-RTT to request data from servers.<br><br>This seems to be setting us up to specifically recommend trading away<br>security in favor of performance.&nbsp; Is that the right tradeoff?<br>(Also, in the vein of my earlier comment, advanced implementation<br>strategies involving detecting the presence of an attack might provide<br>global benefit to the Internet, though the case is a bit weaker here<br>than it was in the other situation.)<br><br>Section 21.10<br><br>&nbsp;

I have yet to review QUIC-RECOVERY so I will assume for now that packet loss by the network (such as RED) will also reduce the "QUIC congestion window".<br><br>NB: I still wonder why QUIC is in upper case if it is a name and not an acronym ;-)<br><br>Please find below some non-blocking COMMENT points (but replies would be appreciated), and some nits.<br><br>I hope that this helps to improve the document,<br><br>Regards,<br><br>-éric<br><br>== COMMENTS ==<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>"QUIC packets are carried in UDP datagrams ([UDP]) to better facilitate deployment in existing systems and networks.", this is an assumption presented as a fact without citing any reference... This does not seem too good to me.<br><br>-- Section 2.2 --<br>&nbsp; "an endpoint MAY treat receipt of different data at<br>&nbsp;  the same offset within a stream as a connection error of type<br>&nbsp;  PROTOCOL_VIOLATION."<br>&nbsp;  <br>Should it be a SHOULD or even a MUST rather than a MAY ? Even if streams are protected, isn't it a security issue to allow overwrite of a stream ? Esp when the endpoints could deliver out-of-order to the application ?<br><br>-- Section 3.1 (and others) --<br>It would have been nice to use the SVG alternate graphic format for such an fundamental document ;-)<br><br>-- Section 4.2 and others&nbsp; --<br>The specification is rather vague about the behavior (no default timer, no default "window", nothing said about increasing the credit, ...) and leaves a lot to implantations. Is it an issue or is it described in QUIC-RECOVERY ?<br><br>-- Section 5.1 --<br>It would be nice for the reader to explain the rationale for having multiple connection IDs for the same connection.<br><br>-- Section 7 --<br>Please state before that QUIC version 0x00000001 is the version specified by the document or use "This version of QUIC" rather than "Version 0x00000001 of QUIC"<br><br>-- Section 8.1 --<br>Out of curiosity, why selecting a UDP payload of at least 1200 octets? I would assume that 1232 would have worked as well (1280 IPv6 MTU - 40 IPv6 header - 8 UDP header). Of course, 1200 is a nicer number ;-)<br><br>-- Section 9 (and also 9.4 and possibly others) --<br>Please also consider adding another reason for an endpoint to change its IPv6 address due to <a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC 4941</a> ("privacy extensions for IPv6 addresses") and not only NAT ;-)<br><br>-- Section 9.1 --<br>Can this mechanism also be used not only when changing of IP address but also of IP version ?<br><br>Did the QUIC WG/authors consider using happy eyeball (<a href="/doc/rfc8305/">RFC 8305</a>) to probe whether IPvfoo could become better than IPvbar regularly during a QUIC connection (using the preferred addresses) ?<br><br>-- Section 9.7 --<br>Why a SHOULD for the use of a hash, IMHO a good pseudo-random number would also work (as explained in <a href="/doc/rfc6437/">RFC 6437</a>).<br><br>-- Section 13 --<br>Should the text provide a forward reference to section 14 (datagram size) ?<br><br>-- Section 14.1 --<br>This padding on the initial packets is quite a smart technique ;-)<br><br>-- Section 17.2.1 --<br>I find a little weird that the "unused" field have a SHOULD setting for the MSB... Suggest to keep the F bit apart and use a 6-bit "unused" field.<br><br>-- Section 18.2 --<br>I am not a transport expert, so, I can be wrong but usually, rather than using "::.0",&nbsp; "[::]:0" is used.<br><br>-- Section 19.2 --<br>Suggest to also mention "keeping NAT binding states alive" as a use case for PING.<br><br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>In "QUIC authenticates all packets and encrypts as much as is practical." it is a little unclear to me whether the 'as much' applies only to 'encrypts' or also on 'authenticates'. Or is it clear for an English-native speaker (that I am not).<br><br>-- Section 1.3 --<br>Rather than using "described by ?" why not using the letter 'l' (as in length) rather than a '?'. It is confusing at first sight.<br><br>-- Section 4.5 --<br>"the final size is the number of bytes sent" is slightly ambiguous as it could either be the number of bytes sent by the application or sent as UDP payload. The rest of the paragraph kind of answers the question though.<br><br>-- Section 5.2.2 --<br>"If a server receives a packet that indicates an unsupported version but is large enough to initiate a new connection" it is unclear what is the subject of "is"...<br><br>-- Section 6.3 --<br>The use of "0x?a?a?a?a" with undefined syntax brings only question marks in the reader's mind =&gt; suggest to remove "0x?a?a?a?a" but keep the forward pointer to section 15.<br><br>-- Section 8.2 --<br>Why using "two-tuple" rather than the simpler "pair" ?<br><br>-- Section 23.1 --<br>Why using the anchor [IPv4] rather than [<a href="/doc/rfc791/">RFC791</a>] ?

If any part of this review is inaccurate, please let us know. <br><br>The IANA Functions Operator has questions about the actions requested in the IANA Considerations section of this document.<br><br>The IANA Functions Operator understands that, upon approval of this document, there are four actions which we must complete.<br><br>First, a new registry page will be created on the IANA Matrix located at:<br><br><a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">https://www.iana.org/protocols</a><br><br>the new registry page will be titled "QUIC" and have a reference of [ RFC-to-be ].<br><br>IANA Question --&gt; Regarding the detailed instructions in section 22.1 of the current document, it's not clear to us what information should be captured in a note. Can you provide the notes that should be added to the top of each registry?<br><br>Second, a new registry will be created on the registry page created above called the QUIC Transport Parameters registry. The new registry will be managed via the Specification Required policy as defined by <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a>.<br><br>IANA will add a note to the registry indicating that: " each value of the format "31 * N + 27" for integer values of N (that is, 27, 58, 89, ...) are reserved."<br><br>IANA Question --&gt; are those values to be marked as reserved in the new registry?<br><br>IANA Question --&gt; Section 22.1.2 says, "Use of the first codepoint in a range is<br>intended for use by specifications that are developed through the<br>standards process [STD] and its allocation MUST be negotiated with<br>IANA before use." <br>&nbsp;  <br>What does "negotiation with IANA" mean? When there's an expert, normally this would be handled by an expert, but we understand that future documents might use this guidance but apply it to registries that have other registration procedures. Does this mean that if IESG Approval were being used, or a future registry that applied this guidance were to use a registration procedure like IETF Review, which requires only an IETF-stream RFC and does not require expert review, and the registration were being requested in an informational or experimental I-D, IANA would need to be aware of this requirement and refuse to register that codepoint? We really want to know what IANA has to know vs. what the other people such as the expert have to know.<br><br>Also, does this mean that codepoints can generally be used before they've been allocated?<br><br>IANA Question --&gt; Section 22.1.2 says, "Applications to register codepoints in QUIC registries MAY include a codepoint as part of the registration.&nbsp; IANA MUST allocate the selected codepoint unless that codepoint is already assigned or the<br>codepoint is the first unallocated codepoint in the registry."<br><br>What if it's the first unallocated codepoint in a range, but not in the registry?<br><br>There are initial registrations in the new registry as follows:<br><br>+=======+=====================================+=============================+<br>| Value | Parameter Name | Reference |<br>+=======+=====================================+=============================+<br>| 0x00 | original_destination_connection_id | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x01 | max_idle_timeout | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x02 | stateless_reset_token | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x03 | max_udp_payload_size | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x04 | initial_max_data | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x05 | initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x06 | initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x07 | initial_max_stream_data_uni | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x08 | initial_max_streams_bidi | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x09 | initial_max_streams_uni | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0a | ack_delay_exponent | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0b | max_ack_delay | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0c | disable_active_migration | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0d | preferred_address | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0e | active_connection_id_limit | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] | +-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x0f | initial_source_connection_id | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br>| 0x10 | retry_source_connection_id | [ RFC-to-be Section 18.2 ] |<br>+-------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+<br><br>Third, a new registry will be created on the QUIC registry page created above called the QUIC Frame Types registry.<br><br>The registration policy for the new registry is as follows:<br><br>0x00 -

Document Announcement Write-Up<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>QUIC is a standards-track, UDP-based, stream-multiplexing, encrypted<br>transport protocol. Its main features are minimizing connection<br>establishment and overall transport latency for applications such as<br>HTTP/3, providing multiplexing without head-of-line blocking, requiring<br>only changes to path endpoints to enable deployment, providing<br>always-secure transport using TLS 1.3.<br><br>This document set specifies the QUIC transport protocol and it<br>version-independent invariants, its loss detection and recovery<br>approach, its use of TLS1.3 for providing security, and a new version of<br>HTTP that uses QUIC (HTTP/3), along with QPACK for header compression in<br>that protocol.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>As can be expected, discussion on many aspects of QUIC was quite<br>intense. The resulting consensus, however, was judged by the chairs to<br>be both strong and broad.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are over twenty implementations of QUIC that are participating in<br>interop testing, including all major web browsers and many server, CDN<br>and standalone library implementations.<br><br>The acknowledgements sections of the I-Ds highlight the individuals that<br>made major contributions to a given document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherds for the individual I-Ds are:<br><br>-&nbsp;  Lucas Pardue:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-http/31/">draft-ietf-quic-http-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-qpack/18/">draft-ietf-quic-qpack-18</a><br>-&nbsp;  Lars Eggert:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/31/">draft-ietf-quic-transport-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-recovery/31/">draft-ietf-quic-recovery-31</a><br>-&nbsp;  Mark Nottingham:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-tls/31/">draft-ietf-quic-tls-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-invariants/11/">draft-ietf-quic-invariants-11</a><br><br>The responsible AD for the document set is Magnus Westerlund.<br><br>3. Document Shepherd Review<br><br>The document shepherds extensively reviewed the documents before this<br>publication request.<br><br>4. Document Shepherd Review Concerns<br><br>The document shepherds have no concerns about the depth or breadth of<br>the reviews for these documents.<br><br>5. Broader Reviews<br><br>Parts of the document set benefited from specialized reviews from the<br>TLS, HTTP and transport IETF communities.<br><br>6. Document Shepherd General Concerns<br><br>The document shepherds have no general concerns about these documents.<br><br>7. IPR Disclosure Obligation<br><br>The editors of the I-Ds have all declared that they have filed any and<br>all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the<br>provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>.<br><br>8. Filed IPR Disclosures<br><br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-recovery/">draft-ietf-quic-recovery</a> has had an IPR disclosure filed on it. No<br>resulting technical changes were argued for.<br><br>9. Strength of Consensus<br><br>The consensus behind the document set is very strong, also as evidenced<br>by the substantial number of existing implementations.<br><br>The WG last calls were forwarded to the TLS and HTTP WGs, due to the<br>topical relationships.<br><br>10.

Document Announcement Write-Up<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>QUIC is a standards-track, UDP-based, stream-multiplexing, encrypted<br>transport protocol. Its main features are minimizing connection<br>establishment and overall transport latency for applications such as<br>HTTP/3, providing multiplexing without head-of-line blocking, requiring<br>only changes to path endpoints to enable deployment, providing<br>always-secure transport using TLS 1.3.<br><br>This document set specifies the QUIC transport protocol and it<br>version-independent invariants, its loss detection and recovery<br>approach, its use of TLS1.3 for providing security, and a new version of<br>HTTP that uses QUIC (HTTP/3), along with QPACK for header compression in<br>that protocol.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>As can be expected, discussion on many aspects of QUIC was quite<br>intense. The resulting consensus, however, was judged by the chairs to<br>be both strong and broad.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are over twenty implementations of QUIC that are participating in<br>interop testing, including all major web browsers and many server, CDN<br>and standalone library implementations.<br><br>The acknowledgements sections of the I-Ds highlight the individuals that<br>made major contributions to a given document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherds for the individual I-Ds are:<br><br>-&nbsp;  Lucas Pardue:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-http/31/">draft-ietf-quic-http-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-qpack/18/">draft-ietf-quic-qpack-18</a><br>-&nbsp;  Lars Eggert:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/31/">draft-ietf-quic-transport-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-recovery/31/">draft-ietf-quic-recovery-31</a><br>-&nbsp;  Mark Nottingham:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-tls/31/">draft-ietf-quic-tls-31</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-invariants/11/">draft-ietf-quic-invariants-11</a><br><br>The responsible AD for the document set is Magnus Westerlund.<br><br>3.
