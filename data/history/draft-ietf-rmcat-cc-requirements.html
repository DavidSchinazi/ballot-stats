With the standardization of RTCweb, an increasing amount of real-time media is expected in the Internet and thus it's important that this traffic is congestion controlled. Real-time media traffic has quite different requirements on congestion control than most the other Internet traffic. The requirements are listed in this document to develop and, later, evaluate one or more congestion control schemes that are more suitable to real-time media traffic than today's existing schemes.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There was quite a lot discussion in the working group on how to define fairness (mainly in respect to evaluation criteria document). For this document the working group concluded to leave the definition of fairness open (to the evaluation criteria document). Only self-fairness was defined (as roughly equal bandwidth). Further there was a discussion on RTT-fairness. This was added as an optional requirement ("if possible").<br><br>Additionally this document address requirements to handle different RTP stream multiplexed into one connection (5-tuple) or different DSCP marking within one connection. Those points where discussed on the RTPweb as well as on the rmcat mailing list.<br><br>As an outcome of the WGLC and IESG Review process additional text on deficiencies of existing mechanisms discussing TFRC as well as further details on jitter and interactions with circuit breakers have been added.

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>Informational. The document specifies requirements for real-time media congestion control and thus is informational for congestion control designers and a basis for the evaluation of these algorithms.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>The documents describes requirements for real-time media congestion control. With the standardization of TRCweb, an increasing amount of real-time media is expected in the Internet and thus it's important that this traffic is congestion controlled. Real-time media traffic has quite different requirements on congestion control as most of the rest of the Internet traffic. The requirements are listed in this document to develop and later evaluate a congestion control scheme that is more suitable to real-time media traffic than today's existing schemes.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There was quite a lot discussion in the working group on how to define fairness (mainly in respect to evaluation criteria document). For this document the working group concluded to leave the definition of fairness open (to the evaluation criteria document). Only self-fairness was defined (as roughly equal bandwidth). Further there was a discussion on RTT-fairness. This was added as an optional requirement ("if possible").<br><br>Additionally this document address requirements to handle different RTP stream multiplexed into one connection (5-tuple) or different DSCP marking within one connection. Those points where discussed on the RTPweb as well as on the rmcat mailing list.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document is an informational requirements document, thus there are no implementations... <br><br>The document received several rounds of reviews in total of 10 different persons (incl. 4 in WGLC and 2 from people mainly working in RTCweb) leading to discussions with even more people involved. These discussions led to several additions and smaller modification to the requirements. <br><br>The document (still) contains two references to other w-g documents of RTCweb and rmcat. Potentially those references should be removed before publication by adding a brief summary of the respective content instead.<br><br>There are (in total) two 'SHOULD's in the document which both probably should be a 'should'.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Mirja Kühlewind (<a href="mailto:mirja.kuehlewind@ikr.uni-stuttgart.de">mirja.kuehlewind@ikr.uni-stuttgart.de</a>) is Docoment Shepherd and one of the rmcat working group chairs.<br>Spencer Dawkins&nbsp; is the Responsible Area Director <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I briefly reviewed the first version of this w-g doc (-00) to be able to contribute to the discussion on the mailing list. Further I performed a detailed review during wglc (-02) and have been sending it to the mailing list. Further I reviewed the current version (-04) to check if various wglc comments from different reviewers have been addressed.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>No. A sufficient number of reviews for the whole document have been performed addressing all kind of issues regarding the content, completeness, comprehensibility as well as the wording and terminology.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>This document is informational. I don't see an security or operational issues. In fact I don't think the security consideration section is needed here, as it currently only discusses general issues on congestion control not specific to real-time media congestion control.<br><br>The document already received two reviews from the RTCweb working group (in wglc).<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>There are no open issues that are discussed in the working group. From my personal view some subbullets in the requirements seems slightly redundant but that doesn't prevent a good understanding of the document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes, the author confirmed that no IPR exists.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The working group as a whole agreed on this document as this is the basis for further documents.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>The abstract contains a reference ([<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview/">I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview</a>]), which it shouldn't.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Does not apply.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>Yes. Normative reference to [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview/">I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview</a>]. I would propose to include the needed terminology into this document and remove the reference or list it as an informative reference as this RTCweb document will probably stay a w-g document until most of the RTCweb work is completed.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>IANA section exists but no considerations required for this document. Thus should be removed before publication.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>Does not apply to this document.<br><br></div></td>
