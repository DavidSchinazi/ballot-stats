If this is a requirement (and the paragraph says it is) then I think it's necessary to be clearer about how it's to be achieved.<br><br>### Section 3.1, Default-Namespace-ID<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A list of IOAM Namespace-IDs (one or more Namespace-IDs)<br>&nbsp;  MUST be included in this container in the echo request, and if<br>&nbsp;  present, the Default-Namespace-ID 0x0000 MUST be placed at the<br>&nbsp;  begining of the list of IOAM Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The IOAM encapsulating<br>&nbsp;  node requests only the enabled IOAM capabilities that match one of<br>&nbsp;  the Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The Namespace-ID has the same definition as<br>&nbsp;  what's specified in Section 4.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>- You specify that if present 0x0000 must be placed at the beginning of the list. Is there any other sorting requirement on the list, or is that the only mandated ordering?<br><br>- It wasn't clear to me from a quick perusal of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> §4.3 whether a request carrying 0x0000 would elicit replies for all Namespace-IDs (since 0x0000 matches everything) or if it would elicit replies only for capabilities that have no configured non-default namespace, or are explicitly configured with namespace 0x0000. Can you either clarify this in the text, or if you think it's clear from the reference, help me understand what makes it clear?<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct (0x0000 elicits replies for all Namespace-IDs) then it would seem that if the list contains 0x0000, it's pointless to include anything else in the list, and that might be worth pointing out in the text.<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct, that would also prompt comments on the use of Namespace-ID field in Sections 3.2.x, but we can address that if needed.<br><br>### Section 3.1, container format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Query Container has a container header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Namespace-IDs) is<br>&nbsp;  zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br><br>&nbsp;  The length, structure, and definition of the IOAM Capabilities Query<br>&nbsp;  Container Header depends on the specific environment it is applied<br>&nbsp;  at.<br>```<br><br>I regret I'm not sufficiently familiar with all the different bearer protocols you're envisioning embedding this container in. So I'll just ask,<br><br>- Why is the length of the payload said to be optional, when it's a (presumably variable-length) list? Does this relate to a bearer protocol where the length of the list is inferred some other way, or what?<br><br>- The specification that the payload is zero-padded to 4-octet alignment carries some implications. Let's explore these with an example. Suppose we want to signal a single Namespace-ID, 0x0001. Then presumably the payload has to be 0x0001 0x0000, once the mandated pad bytes are added. Is the receiver supposed to know that it ignores the 0x0000 value (which is otherwise the Default-Namespace-ID) because it comes at the end of the list, not the beginning as the previous paragraph required? If so, this seems worth calling out. If not, how is the receiver supposed to know where payload ends and padding begins?<br><br>### Section 3.2, container format, padding<br><br>Similar questions to those above apply to:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Response Container has a container header that<br>&nbsp;  is used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Capabilities<br>&nbsp;  Objects) is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>That is, considering you've disclaimed defining specifics about the semantics of the header, how is the recipient of one of these things supposed to know how to ignore the zero-padding?<br><br>I do see that all the objects you've defined in this document are a multiple of four bytes long (if we assume their unspecified headers are a multiple of four byte long, that is!) so no padding would ever be required for a payload consisting only of these objects, and thus my question wouldn't apply. But if that's the answer to my question, then the final clause I quote above (about zero-padding) should just be removed.<br><br>### Section 3.2, object format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Similar to the container, each object has an object header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and length of the object payload, and the<br>&nbsp;  object payload is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>Similar to the above, in some cases there will be a need to know how to separate payload from padding. In all the objects you defined in Sections 3.2.x this is unnecessary (*if* you assume the unspecified header is 4-octet aligned itself) since you've carefully specified them so that they don't require padding. <br><br>It might be more straightforward to just mandate that future object specifications have a length that is a multiple of four octets, as all of your current ones do. That defers the question of what to do about variable payloads to the specification of the -- notional? -- object that has such a payload.<br><br>### Section 4<br><br>You talk about TTL in the first paragraph. Do you mean "TTL or Hop Limit"?<br><br>### Section 6, integrity protection<br><br>You talk about integrity protection in passing. Let's assume a deployment hasn't enabled any kind of integrity protection. Have you done any analysis of what kind of mischief an attacker could cause by inserting incorrect capabilities in a forged response? <br><br>### Section 6, MBZ fields<br><br>You suggest checking the must-be-zero reserved fields and reporting an exception if they aren't zero. Often, such reserved fields are expected to be extended in future, and indeed this is what you indicate in this spec too. I guess since the packets terminate at the recipient of the reply, it's not terribly harmful to police that these be zero, but it would likely create an awfully noisy set of exceptions in the case of a partially rolled-out extension. Is this really a good recommendation? The more usual practice is of the form "must be zero on Tx, must be ignored on Rx".<br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

If this is a requirement (and the paragraph says it is) then I think it's necessary to be clearer about how it's to be achieved.<br><br>### Section 3.1, Default-Namespace-ID<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A list of IOAM Namespace-IDs (one or more Namespace-IDs)<br>&nbsp;  MUST be included in this container in the echo request, and if<br>&nbsp;  present, the Default-Namespace-ID 0x0000 MUST be placed at the<br>&nbsp;  begining of the list of IOAM Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The IOAM encapsulating<br>&nbsp;  node requests only the enabled IOAM capabilities that match one of<br>&nbsp;  the Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The Namespace-ID has the same definition as<br>&nbsp;  what's specified in Section 4.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>- You specify that if present 0x0000 must be placed at the beginning of the list. Is there any other sorting requirement on the list, or is that the only mandated ordering?<br><br>- It wasn't clear to me from a quick perusal of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> §4.3 whether a request carrying 0x0000 would elicit replies for all Namespace-IDs (since 0x0000 matches everything) or if it would elicit replies only for capabilities that have no configured non-default namespace, or are explicitly configured with namespace 0x0000. Can you either clarify this in the text, or if you think it's clear from the reference, help me understand what makes it clear?<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct (0x0000 elicits replies for all Namespace-IDs) then it would seem that if the list contains 0x0000, it's pointless to include anything else in the list, and that might be worth pointing out in the text.<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct, that would also prompt comments on the use of Namespace-ID field in Sections 3.2.x, but we can address that if needed.<br><br>### Section 3.1, container format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Query Container has a container header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Namespace-IDs) is<br>&nbsp;  zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br><br>&nbsp;  The length, structure, and definition of the IOAM Capabilities Query<br>&nbsp;  Container Header depends on the specific environment it is applied<br>&nbsp;  at.<br>```<br><br>I regret I'm not sufficiently familiar with all the different bearer protocols you're envisioning embedding this container in. So I'll just ask,<br><br>- Why is the length of the payload said to be optional, when it's a (presumably variable-length) list? Does this relate to a bearer protocol where the length of the list is inferred some other way, or what?<br><br>- The specification that the payload is zero-padded to 4-octet alignment carries some implications. Let's explore these with an example. Suppose the payload is a single Namespace-ID, 0x0001. Then presumably the payload has to be 0x0001 0x0000, once the mandated pad bytes are added. Is the receiver supposed to know that it ignores the 0x0000 value (which is otherwise the Default-Namespace-ID) because it comes at the end of the list, not the beginning as the previous paragraph required? If so, this seems worth calling out. If not, how is the receiver supposed to know where payload ends and padding begins?<br><br>### Section 3.2, container format, padding<br><br>Similar questions to those above apply to:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Response Container has a container header that<br>&nbsp;  is used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Capabilities<br>&nbsp;  Objects) is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>That is, considering you've disclaimed defining specifics about the semantics of the header, how is the recipient of one of these things supposed to know how to ignore the zero-padding?<br><br>I do see that all the objects you've defined in this document are a multiple of four bytes long (if we assume their unspecified headers are a multiple of four byte long, that is!) so no padding would ever be required for a payload consisting only of these objects, and thus my question wouldn't apply. But if that's the answer to my question, then the final clause I quote above (about zero-padding) should just be removed.<br><br>### Section 3.2, object format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Similar to the container, each object has an object header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and length of the object payload, and the<br>&nbsp;  object payload is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>Similar to the above, in some cases there will be a need to know how to separate payload from padding. In all the objects you defined in Sections 3.2.x this is unnecessary (*if* you assume the unspecified header is 4-octet aligned itself) since you've carefully specified them so that they don't require padding. <br><br>It might be more straightforward to just mandate that future object specifications have a length that is a multiple of four octets, as all of your current ones do. That defers the question of what to do about variable payloads to the specification of the -- notional? -- object that has such a payload.<br><br>### Section 4<br><br>You talk about TTL in the first paragraph. Do you mean "TTL or Hop Limit"?<br><br>### Section 6<br><br>- You talk about integrity protection in passing. Let's assume a deployment hasn't enabled any kind of integrity protection. Have you done any analysis of what kind of mischief an attacker could cause by inserting incorrect capabilities in a forged response? <br><br>- You suggest checking the must-be-zero reserved fields and reporting an exception if they aren't zero. Often, such reserved fields are expected to be extended in future, and indeed this is what you indicate in this spec too. I guess since the packets terminate at the recipient of the reply, it's not terribly harmful to police that these be zero, but it would likely create an awfully noisy set of exceptions in the case of a partially rolled-out extension. Is this really a good recommendation? The more usual practice is of the form "must be zero on Tx, must be ignored on Rx".<br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

If this is a requirement (and the paragraph says it is) then I think it's necessary to be clearer about how it's to be achieved.<br><br>### Section 3.1, Default-Namespace-ID<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A list of IOAM Namespace-IDs (one or more Namespace-IDs)<br>&nbsp;  MUST be included in this container in the echo request, and if<br>&nbsp;  present, the Default-Namespace-ID 0x0000 MUST be placed at the<br>&nbsp;  begining of the list of IOAM Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The IOAM encapsulating<br>&nbsp;  node requests only the enabled IOAM capabilities that match one of<br>&nbsp;  the Namespace-IDs.&nbsp; The Namespace-ID has the same definition as<br>&nbsp;  what's specified in Section 4.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>- You specify that if present 0x0000 must be placed at the beginning of the list. Is there any other sorting requirement on the list, or is that the only mandated ordering?<br><br>- It wasn't clear to me from a quick perusal of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> §4.3 whether a request carrying 0x0000 would elicit replies for all Namespace-IDs (since 0x0000 matches everything) or if it would elicit replies only for capabilities that have no configured non-default namespace, or are explicitly configured with namespace 0x0000. Can you either clarify this in the text, or if you think it's clear from the reference, help me understand what makes it clear?<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct (0x0000 elicits replies for all Namespace-IDs) then it would seem that if the list contains 0x0000, it's pointless to include anything else in the list, and that might be worth pointing out in the text.<br><br>- If the first guess above is correct, that would also prompt comments on the use of Namespace-ID field in Sections 3.2.x, but we can address that if needed.<br><br>### Section 3.1, container format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Query Container has a container header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Namespace-IDs) is<br>&nbsp;  zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br><br>&nbsp;  The length, structure, and definition of the IOAM Capabilities Query<br>&nbsp;  Container Header depends on the specific environment it is applied<br>&nbsp;  at.<br>```<br><br>I regret I'm not sufficiently familiar with all the different bearer protocols you're envisioning embedding this container in. So I'll just ask,<br><br>- Why is the length of the payload said to be optional, when it's a (presumably variable-length) list? Does this relate to a bearer protocol where the length of the list is inferred some other way, or what?<br><br>- The specification that the payload is zero-padded to 4-octet alignment carries some implications. Let's explore these with an example. Suppose the payload is a single Namespace-ID, 0x0001. Then presumably the payload has to be 0x0001 0x0000, once the mandated pad bytes are added. Is the receiver supposed to know that it ignores the 0x0000 value (which is otherwise the Default-Namespace-ID) because it comes at the end of the list, not the beginning as the previous paragraph required? If so, this seems worth calling out. If not, how is the receiver supposed to know where payload ends and padding begins?<br><br>### Section 3.2, container format, padding<br><br>Similar questions to those above apply to:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The IOAM Capabilities Response Container has a container header that<br>&nbsp;  is used to identify the type and optionally length of the container<br>&nbsp;  payload, and the container payload (List of IOAM Capabilities<br>&nbsp;  Objects) is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>That is, considering you've disclaimed defining specifics about the semantics of the header, how is the recipient of one of these things supposed to know how to ignore the zero-padding?<br><br>I do see that all the objects you've defined in this document are a multiple of four bytes long (if we assume their unspecified headers are a multiple of four byte long, that is!) so no padding would ever be required for a payload consisting only of these objects, and thus my question wouldn't apply. But if that's the answer to my question, then the final clause I quote above (about zero-padding) should just be removed.<br><br>### Section 3.2, object format, padding<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Similar to the container, each object has an object header that is<br>&nbsp;  used to identify the type and length of the object payload, and the<br>&nbsp;  object payload is zero-padded to align to a 4-octet boundary.<br>```<br><br>Similar to the above, in some cases there will be a need to know how to separate payload from padding. In all the objects you defined in Sections 3.2.x this is unnecessary (*if* you assume the unspecified header is 4-octet aligned itself) since you've carefully specified them so that they don't require padding. <br><br>It might be more straightforward to just mandate that future object specifications have a length that is a multiple of four octets, as all of your current ones do. That defers the question of what to do about variable payloads to the specification of the -- notional? -- object that has such a payload.<br><br>### Section 4<br><br>You talk about TTL in the first paragraph. Do you mean "TTL or Hop Limit"?<br><br>### Section 6<br><br>- You talk about integrity protection in passing. Let's assume a deployment hasn't enabled any kind of integrity protection. Have you done any analysis of what kind of mischief an attacker could cause by inserting incorrect capabilities in a forged response? <br><br>- You suggest checking the must-be-zero reserved fields and reporting an exception if they aren't zero. Often, such reserved fields are expected to be extended in future, and indeed this is what you indicate in this spec too. I guess since the packets terminate at the recipient of the reply, it's not terribly harmful to police that these be zero, but it would likely create an awfully noisy set of exceptions in the case of a partially rolled-out extension. Is this really a good recommendation? The more usual practice is of the form "must be zero on Tx, must be ignored on Rx".<br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

The Abstract says: "This document describes an extension to the echo request/reply mechanisms used in [...]", but from what I can tell, it is more "here are some containers that you could use in some other protocols".<br><br>It seems like, instead of only relying on the network for filtering (which doesn't yet seem to be implemented), the:<br>"To protect against unauthorized sources using echo request messages to obtain IOAM Capabilities information, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations provide a means of checking the source addresses of echo request messages against an access list before accepting the message."<br>should be made stronger.

Consider shortening it.<br><br>The `echo request/reply mechanisms used in IPv6 ...` would benefit of being qualified (perhaps with 'generic' or 'specified' ?).<br><br>### Section 1<br><br>The IPv6 node information query, while sent over ICMPv6, is not really an 'echo/request' exchange, hence the title of this RFC is not really adequate. I have no suggestion though.<br><br>### Section 2.2<br><br>When defining "TTL" please also add that this is the hop-limit field in the IPv6 header (which has no TTL field).<br><br>### Section 3.2.1 and other sections including 3.2.6 "Must be zero"<br><br>Please do not forget to specify the receiver's behavior when receiving reserved bits that are no all 0.<br><br>### Section 3.2.3<br><br>Explaining what "SoP" is would ease the reading.<br><br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp;  The WG consensus represents the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with<br>&nbsp;  others being silent.&nbsp; <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  The strongest criticism has been related to not being fully aligned with <br>&nbsp;  the data model described in: draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-yang. There have been <br>&nbsp;  disagreements on the usefulness of this feature (why is there a need for <br>&nbsp;  IOAM capability discovery within a limited domain?). <br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no current implementations known to the shepherd or the authors.<br>&nbsp;  ZTE and China Telecom have expressed that they intend to implement the <br>&nbsp;  solution described in the document.&nbsp; <br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  No<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is needed (as expressed by some WG members) and technically <br>&nbsp;  sound. There is room for improvement of the language in the document, but<br>&nbsp;  overall it's ready to progress. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard as it builds upon other IOAM standards such as <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The datatracker state attributes reflect this intent.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a single IPR [13] relating to IOAM in general. The authors have <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; confirmed that they are not aware of any additional IPRs. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes.<br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The abstract consists of several abbreviations, none of them expanded. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 3:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; References to ioam-data (<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>) point to the wrong section numbers:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM-Trace-Type field is defined in section 4.4 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Namespace-ID field is defined in section 4.3 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM-POT-Type field is defined in section 4.5 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM-E2E-Type field is defined in section 4.6 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ID nits output:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdated reference: <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data/">draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data</a> has been published as <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 9197</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdated reference: A later version (-09) exists of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export/07/">draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export-07</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdated reference: A later version (-19) exists of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-sfc-multi-layer-oam/18/">draft-ietf-sfc-multi-layer-oam-18</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdated reference: A later version (-01) exists of <a href="/doc/draft-xiao-6man-icmpv6-ioam-conf-state/00/">draft-xiao-6man-icmpv6-ioam-conf-state-00</a><br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n/a<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a normative reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export/">I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export</a> which is <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; currently under IESG evaluation.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n/a<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Contains a request for a new registry group with an appropriate name:&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "In-Situ OAM (IOAM) Capabilities Parameters".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Two registries are proposed for the group:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM SoP Capability Registry<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM TSF Capability Registry<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Both registries have descriptive names and short descriptions with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references to relevant technical content.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There's a small nit in section 5.2 which states that the registry <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; defines three code points. It actually defines four, and assigns <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; three. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations.

Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no current implementations known to the shepherd or the authors.<br>&nbsp;  ZTE and China Telecom have expressed that they intend to implement the <br>&nbsp;  solution described in the document.&nbsp; <br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  No<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  n/a<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is needed (as expressed by some WG members) and technically <br>&nbsp;  sound. There is room for improvement of the language in the document, but<br>&nbsp;  overall it's ready to progress. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard as it builds upon other IOAM standards such as <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The datatracker state attributes reflect this intent.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a single IPR [13] relating to IOAM in general. The authors have <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; confirmed that they are not aware of any additional IPRs. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes.<br><br>14.

Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n/a<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a normative reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export/">I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export</a> which is <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; currently under IESG evaluation.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; n/a<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Contains a request for a new registry group with an appropriate name:&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "In-Situ OAM (IOAM) Capabilities Parameters".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Two registries are proposed for the group:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM SoP Capability Registry<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IOAM TSF Capability Registry<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Both registries have descriptive names and short descriptions with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references to relevant technical content.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There's a small nit in section 5.2 which states that the registry <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; defines three code points.
