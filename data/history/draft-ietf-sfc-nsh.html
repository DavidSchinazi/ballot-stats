However, some points could be clarified such that these open points do not warrant to hold a discuss anymore.<br><br>--------------------<br>Old discuss text:<br>--------------------<br>I have a couple of comments on the design. I know, as always in IESG review state, it's probably too late to make any changes to the actual header format, therefore most of my comments are actually in the comment section below. I still decided to note them so at least people can consider these points. However, there are a few things that I need clarification for before publication, which I note in this section:<br><br>1) Sec 2.2<br>"SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support SFC<br>&nbsp;  OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY support<br>&nbsp;  a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified to the next element in the chain.&nbsp; Forwarding OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not support SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM functions, but can<br>&nbsp;  result in unexpected outcomes for others; thus, it is recommended to<br>&nbsp;  analyze the impact of forwarding an OAM packet for all OAM functions<br>&nbsp;  prior to enabling this behavior.&nbsp; The configurable parameter MUST be<br>&nbsp;  disabled by default."<br>This part is really unclear to me and I believe needs to be further specified. Where should this configurable parameter be? In the Context header? Why don't you just use one of the unassigned bit to indicate if an unknown (OAM) packet should be forwarded or not? <br>Moreover, I also disagree with this text. If there is a bit/a way to indicate if a not supported OAM packet should be forwarded or not, it should just be defined like this, while any considerations if that bit should be set or not depend on the OAM function itself and do not need to be discussed here.<br>Finally, it is not well explained what an OAM packet is at all. Is that a 'fake' packet that is generated by the operator to actively test the (potentially newly configured) SFP? If so, why does a SF need to know if a packet is an OAM packet or not? Usually it's a bad idea to use different kind of traffic for testing compared to what will be used in operations. Please provide more explanation here!<br><br>2) section 2.4<br>"An SFC-aware SF MUST receive the data semantics first in order to<br>&nbsp;  process the data placed in the mandatory context field.&nbsp; The data<br>&nbsp;  semantics include both the allocation schema and the meaning of the<br>&nbsp;  included data.&nbsp; How an SFC-aware SF gets the data semantics is<br>&nbsp;  outside the scope of this specification."<br>This is really confusing to me. I think this is what you need an actually data semantics aka type field for in the base header. Or is there an actual reason to not put this information directly in the base header where it is need but instead assuming some magical way this information may take to reach the node? If the assumption is that the SF is configured to know based of the SFI what the content of the context header has to be, you a) need to say that in the draft, and b) that's really error-prone because it's really hard to tell if the conext header actually holds the information that you need or just random crap (of course depending of the expected data type of this information). In short, I think you really need a type field somewhere here. In any case, you really need to explain this more!<br>Also, the text further says:<br>"An SF or SFC Proxy that does not know the format or semantics of the<br>&nbsp;  Context Header for an NSH with MD Type 1 MUST discard any packet with<br>&nbsp;  such an NSH..."<br>How does the SFC proxy know that it knows the format or not if there is no type field or identifier that indicates what the format should be?<br><br>Also, a related question from me: why is the context header present in all types of NSH if there is no use for it defined in this document yet? Why is there no fixed length NSH without a context header then?<br><br>3) Section 2.5.1:<br>"If multiple instances of the same metadata are included in an NSH<br>&nbsp;  packet, but the definition of that context header does not allow for<br>&nbsp;  it, the SFC-aware SF MUST process the first instance and ignore<br>&nbsp;  subsequent instances."<br>This seems error prone to me. If the same metadata appears multiple where it should not, that seems clearly like an error case for me. Just using the first one and proceed normally might not be the right thing to do. In any case I think such an occasion should at least be logged. If the multiple instances are just a copy of each other and carry the same information, it's probably okay to use that information and proceed. If the different instances carry different information, it maybe a bit dangerous to just use the first one and ignore others silently. In this case I would rather recommend to drop the packet...<br><br>4) In line with the second comment from the tsv-art review (thanks Wes!), I don't really understand why this documents says (sec 6) that there can be multiple next hops for the same SFP or SFs can be traversed in a different order. May understanding (from a quick look at <a href="/doc/rfc7665/">RFC7665</a>) would be that, if those things are needed e.g. for load balancing, then one should define different SFPs and the Classifier must have the knowledge that two SFP are equivalent and select them respectively. The reason why I'm really concerned about this is that usually a number of packets below to a flow and all packets belonging to the same flow just ideally take the same route. But usually only the Classifier has a notion of what a flow is and respectively will assign the SFI to the packets belonging to the same flow. If now any SF on the path can more or less randomly decided to forward packet belong to the same flow to one or another next nodes, I would assume that this is not only a problem for the flow, e.g. reordering, but also for SF itself in many cases.<br><br>------------------------<br>Old comment text:<br>------------------------<br><br>Further considerations:<br><br>1) I don't really see why a TTL in the base header is needed. I mostly understand why there is the Service Index in service header, also I think there should be better mean to validate that you SFP is correct and I ideally you should really not need this. However, loop prevention can be provided by both mechanism and moreover there is probably also often a TTL in the encapsulation protocol and loop prevention should really be a function of that forwarding protocol and not the NSH. <br><br>2) I don't see why you need the type field in the base header. This is fully redundant because because all you need is the length field. If the length is 0x2 it is what you have defined as type 1 if the length field is larger it is type 2. I also don't see the need for any other types in future because you also have the version field; if you need anything else you should go or probably have to go for a new version. Note that the general probably with unnecessary redundancy is that is add complexity. If you keep this redundancy you have to separately handle and implement the case(s) where the type is 1 but the length is larger than expected. If at all you could probably just use one bit to indicate that the length field is present and if not the length is 0x2. However, saving bits does not really seem to be a concern for you, so that might not actually be an advantage.<br><br>3) sec 2.5.1<br>"Unassigned bit: One unassigned bit is available for future use.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  bit MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt."<br>Is there an actual reason to have an unassigned bit here? Because I would assume that the type already provided enough flexibility for way to extend the metadata format in any way needed.<br><br>4) Also section 2.5.1:<br>"&nbsp;  Length: Indicates the length of the variable metadata, in bytes.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  case the metadata length is not an integer number of 4-byte words,<br>&nbsp;  the sender MUST add pad bytes immediately following the last metadata<br>&nbsp;  byte to extend the metadata to an integer number of 4-byte words.<br>&nbsp;  The receiver MUST round up the length field to the nearest 4-byte<br>&nbsp;  word boundary, to locate and process the next field in the packet."<br>Your definition of the length field might be more error-prone than needed. It would probably be easier to simply define the length as 4-byte words, and the&nbsp; type of course defines the content of the metadata field and as such can simply define which part of the total metadata field holds certain data of a certain type and with part is padding.<br><br>5) And finally I have to say it is unclear to me why the SFI and SI field are described as a separate header. Given they have to be present in all SFH, I would consider them as two fields of the base header. But it is after all really just an editorial issue. However, all this together with my previous comments makes the protocol spec actually much more complicated than it needs to be...<br><br>6) I also have to agree to the last comment of the tsv-art review: I think it would have been nicer to not only described the NSH but also define mappings to a set of possible encapsulations because I would assume that for each encapsulation there are a couple specific considerations that need to be made to make things work successfully. I don't think that all encapsulations can be captured by general consideration and I cannot make up my mind to go through all cases in my head to figure out if there are things that needs to be noted.</div></td>

However, some points could be clarified such that these open points do not warrant to hold a discuss anymore.<br><br>--------------------<br>Old discuss text:<br>--------------------<br>I have a couple of comments on the design. I know, as always in IESG review state, it's probably too late to make any changes to the actual header format, therefore most of my comments are actually in the comment section below. I still decided to note them so at least people can consider these points. However, there are a few things that I need clarification for before publication, which I note in this section:<br><br>1) Sec 2.2<br>"SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support SFC<br>&nbsp;  OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY support<br>&nbsp;  a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified to the next element in the chain.&nbsp; Forwarding OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not support SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM functions, but can<br>&nbsp;  result in unexpected outcomes for others; thus, it is recommended to<br>&nbsp;  analyze the impact of forwarding an OAM packet for all OAM functions<br>&nbsp;  prior to enabling this behavior.&nbsp; The configurable parameter MUST be<br>&nbsp;  disabled by default."<br>This part is really unclear to me and I believe needs to be further specified. Where should this configurable parameter be? In the Context header? Why don't you just use one of the unassigned bit to indicate if an unknown (OAM) packet should be forwarded or not? <br>Moreover, I also disagree with this text. If there is a bit/a way to indicate if a not supported OAM packet should be forwarded or not, it should just be defined like this, while any considerations if that bit should be set or not depend on the OAM function itself and do not need to be discussed here.<br>Finally, it is not well explained what an OAM packet is at all. Is that a 'fake' packet that is generated by the operator to actively test the (potentially newly configured) SFP? If so, why does a SF need to know if a packet is an OAM packet or not? Usually it's a bad idea to use different kind of traffic for testing compared to what will be used in operations. Please provide more explanation here!<br><br>2) section 2.4<br>"An SFC-aware SF MUST receive the data semantics first in order to<br>&nbsp;  process the data placed in the mandatory context field.&nbsp; The data<br>&nbsp;  semantics include both the allocation schema and the meaning of the<br>&nbsp;  included data.&nbsp; How an SFC-aware SF gets the data semantics is<br>&nbsp;  outside the scope of this specification."<br>This is really confusing to me. I think this is what you need an actually data semantics aka type field for in the base header. Or is there an actual reason to not put this information directly in the base header where it is need but instead assuming some magical way this information may take to reach the node? If the assumption is that the SF is configured to know based of the SFI what the content of the context header has to be, you a) need to say that in the draft, and b) that's really error-prone because it's really hard to tell if the conext header actually holds the information that you need or just random crap (of course depending of the expected data type of this information). In short, I think you really need a type field somewhere here. In any case, you really need to explain this more!<br>Also, the text further says:<br>"An SF or SFC Proxy that does not know the format or semantics of the<br>&nbsp;  Context Header for an NSH with MD Type 1 MUST discard any packet with<br>&nbsp;  such an NSH..."<br>How does the SFC proxy know that it knows the format or not if there is no type field or identifier that indicates what the format should be?<br><br>Also, a related question from me: why is the context header present in all types of NSH if there is no use for it defined in this document yet? Why is there no fixed length NSH without a context header then?<br><br>3) Section 2.5.1:<br>"If multiple instances of the same metadata are included in an NSH<br>&nbsp;  packet, but the definition of that context header does not allow for<br>&nbsp;  it, the SFC-aware SF MUST process the first instance and ignore<br>&nbsp;  subsequent instances."<br>This seems error prone to me. If the same metadata appears multiple where it should not, that seems clearly like an error case for me. Just using the first one and proceed normally might not be the right thing to do. In any case I think such an occasion should at least be logged. If the multiple instances are just a copy of each other and carry the same information, it's probably okay to use that information and proceed. If the different instances carry different information, it maybe a bit dangerous to just use the first one and ignore others silently. In this case I would rather recommend to drop the packet...<br><br>4) In line with the second comment from the tsv-art review (thanks Wes!), I don't really understand why this documents says (sec 6) that there can be multiple next hops for the same SFP or SFs can be traversed in a different order. May understanding (from a quick look at <a href="/doc/rfc7665/">RFC7665</a>) would be that, if those things are needed e.g. for load balancing, then one should define different SFPs and the Classifier must have the knowledge that two SFP are equivalent and select them respectively. The reason why I'm really concerned about this is that usually a number of packets below to a flow and all packets belonging to the same flow just ideally take the same route. But usually only the Classifier has a notion of what a flow is and respectively will assign the SFI to the packets belonging to the same flow. If now any SF on the path can more or less randomly decided to forward packet belong to the same flow to one or another next nodes, I would assume that this is not only a problem for the flow, e.g. reordering, but also for SF itself in many cases.<br><br>------------------------<br>Old comment text:<br>------------------------<br><br>Further considerations:<br><br>1) I don't really see why a TTL in the base header is needed. I mostly understand why there is the Service Index in service header, also I think there should be better mean to validate that you SFP is correct and I ideally you should really not need this. However, loop prevention can be provided by both mechanism and moreover there is probably also often a TTL in the encapsulation protocol and loop prevention should really be a function of that forwarding protocol and not the NSH. <br><br>2) I don't see why you need the type field in the base header. This is fully redundant because because all you need is the length field. If the length is 0x2 it is what you have defined as type 1 if the length field is larger it is type 2. I also don't see the need for any other types in future because you also have the version field; if you need anything else you should go or probably have to go for a new version. Note that the general probably with unnecessary redundancy is that is add complexity. If you keep this redundancy you have to separately handle and implement the case(s) where the type is 1 but the length is larger than expected. If at all you could probably just use one bit to indicate that the length field is present and if not the length is 0x2. However, saving bits does not really seem to be a concern for you, so that might not actually be an advantage.<br><br>3) sec 2.5.1<br>"Unassigned bit: One unassigned bit is available for future use.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  bit MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt."<br>Is there an actual reason to have an unassigned bit here? Because I would assume that the type already provided enough flexibility for way to extend the metadata format in any way needed.<br><br>4) Also section 2.5.1:<br>"&nbsp;  Length: Indicates the length of the variable metadata, in bytes.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  case the metadata length is not an integer number of 4-byte words,<br>&nbsp;  the sender MUST add pad bytes immediately following the last metadata<br>&nbsp;  byte to extend the metadata to an integer number of 4-byte words.<br>&nbsp;  The receiver MUST round up the length field to the nearest 4-byte<br>&nbsp;  word boundary, to locate and process the next field in the packet."<br>Your definition of the length field might be more error-prone than needed. It would probably be easier to simply define the length as 4-byte words, and the&nbsp; type of course defines the content of the metadata field and as such can simply define which part of the total metadata field holds certain data of a certain type and with part is padding.<br><br>5) And finally I have to say it is unclear to me why the SFI and SI field are described as a separate header. Given they have to be present in all SFH, I would consider them as two fields of the base header. But it is after all really just an editorial issue. However, all this together with my previous comments makes the protocol spec actually much more complicated than it needs to be...<br><br>6) I also have to agree to the last comment of the tsv-art review: I think it would have been nicer to not only described the NSH but also define mappings to a set of possible encapsulations because I would assume that for each encapsulation there are a couple specific considerations that need to be made to make things work successfully. I don't think that all encapsulations can be captured by general consideration and I cannot make up my mind to go through all cases in my head to figure out if there are things that needs to be noted.</div></td>

As Kathleen and Adam both observer, datacenter<br>breaches are common and that is why people are moving towards<br>encryption inside the data center. I see that this draft has text<br>claiming that this is only to be deployed in safe environments, but we<br>know that technologies like this get deployed outside the locations<br>for which we claim they are to be deployed, and there's nothing here<br>to stop that. Moreover, the whole trend towards cloud computing pushes<br>us away from designs in which you can safely talk about single secure<br>zones.<br><br>2. The text in S 8.1 about how you might want to use some kind of<br>transport security does not seem sufficient.

Given that as S 1 makes clear, all these SFs are part of<br>the same administrative domain, this seems like a comparatively less<br>challenging setting.

The "crunchy perimeter, soft center" model of security was flawed to start with; and, even in those arenas where it was once fashionable, it's starting to be considered dated (e.g., much of the traffic inside data centers is secured using TLS -- see the recent discussions in the TLS working group for evidence of this situation). More notably, this "unconditionally trusted network zone" approach to security has led to some spectacular exploits recently (cf. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/the-critical-hole-at-the-heart-of-cell-phone-infrastructure/">https://www.wired.com/2016/04/the-critical-hole-at-the-heart-of-cell-phone-infrastructure/</a>). Rather than explicitly fostering this model, the security section really needs to normatively disallow it.<br><br>(n.b., I reviewed version -21 of the document -- but I don't find the changes between that version and -24 to address the issue Kathleen raises)<br><br>----<br><br>Section 3 says the following about reclassification behavior:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When the logical classifier performs re-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  classification that results in a change of service path, it MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  replace the existing NSH with a new NSH with the Base Header and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Service Path Header reflecting the new service path information<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and MUST set the initial SI.&nbsp; The O bit, as well as unassigned<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  flags, MUST be copied transparently from the old NSH to a new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NSH.&nbsp; Metadata MAY be preserved in the new NSH.<br><br>I don't see anything here about copying the TTL. If the TTL isn't copied, you can end up with a stable (and unending) loop involving two classifiers (which seems even more damaging than usual, as the SI value won't generally survive a reclassification, right?). I would suggest adding "TTL" to the list of things that MUST be copied when reclassification occurs.</div></td>

I mostly understand why there is the Service Index in service header, also I think there should be better mean to validate that you SFP is correct and I ideally you should really not need this. However, loop prevention can be provided by both mechanism and moreover there is probably also often a TTL in the encapsulation protocol and loop prevention should really be a function of that forwarding protocol and not the NSH. <br><br>2) I don't see why you need the type field in the base header. This is fully redundant because because all you need is the length field. If the length is 0x2 it is what you have defined as type 1 if the length field is larger it is type 2. I also don't see the need for any other types in future because you also have the version field; if you need anything else you should go or probably have to go for a new version. Note that the general probably with unnecessary redundancy is that is add complexity. If you keep this redundancy you have to separately handle and implement the case(s) where the type is 1 but the length is larger than expected. If at all you could probably just use one bit to indicate that the length field is present and if not the length is 0x2. However, saving bits does not really seem to be a concern for you, so that might not actually be an advantage.<br><br>3) sec 2.5.1<br>"Unassigned bit: One unassigned bit is available for future use.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  bit MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt."<br>Is there an actual reason to have an unassigned bit here?

It would probably be easier to simply define the length as 4-byte words, and the&nbsp; type of course defines the content of the metadata field and as such can simply define which part of the total metadata field holds certain data of a certain type and with part is padding.<br><br>5) And finally I have to say it is unclear to me why the SFI and SI field are described as a separate header. Given they have to be present in all SFH, I would consider them as two fields of the base header. But it is after all really just an editorial issue. However, all this together with my previous comments makes the protocol spec actually much more complicated than it needs to be...<br><br>6) I also have to agree to the last comment of the tsv-art review: I think it would have been nicer to not only described the NSH but also define mappings to a set of possible encapsulations because I would assume that for each encapsulation there are a couple specific considerations that need to be made to make things work successfully. I don't think that all encapsulations can be captured by general consideration and I cannot make up my mind to go through all cases in my head to figure out if there are things that needs to be noted.</div></td>

I know, as always in IESG review state, it's probably too late to make any changes to the actual header format, therefore most of my comments are actually in the comment section below. I still decided to note them so at least people can consider these points. However, there are a few things that I need clarification for before publication, which I note in this section:<br><br>1) Sec 2.2<br>"SF/SFF/SFC Proxy/Classifier implementations that do not support SFC<br>&nbsp;  OAM procedures SHOULD discard packets with O bit set, but MAY support<br>&nbsp;  a configurable parameter to enable forwarding received SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified to the next element in the chain.&nbsp; Forwarding OAM<br>&nbsp;  packets unmodified by SFC elements that do not support SFC OAM<br>&nbsp;  procedures may be acceptable for a subset of OAM functions, but can<br>&nbsp;  result in unexpected outcomes for others; thus, it is recommended to<br>&nbsp;  analyze the impact of forwarding an OAM packet for all OAM functions<br>&nbsp;  prior to enabling this behavior.&nbsp; The configurable parameter MUST be<br>&nbsp;  disabled by default."<br>This part is really unclear to me and I believe needs to be further specified. Where should this configurable parameter be? In the Context header? Why don't you just use one of the unassigned bit to indicate if an unknown (OAM) packet should be forwarded or not? <br>Moreover, I also disagree with this text. If there is a bit/a way to indicate if a not supported OAM packet should be forwarded or not, it should just be defined like this, while any considerations if that bit should be set or not depend on the OAM function itself and do not need to be discussed here.<br>Finally, it is not well explained what an OAM packet is at all. Is that a 'fake' packet that is generated by the operator to actively test the (potentially newly configured) SFP? If so, why does a SF need to know if a packet is an OAM packet or not? Usually it's a bad idea to use different kind of traffic for testing compared to what will be used in operations. Please provide more explanation here!<br><br>2) section 2.4<br>"An SFC-aware SF MUST receive the data semantics first in order to<br>&nbsp;  process the data placed in the mandatory context field.&nbsp; The data<br>&nbsp;  semantics include both the allocation schema and the meaning of the<br>&nbsp;  included data.&nbsp; How an SFC-aware SF gets the data semantics is<br>&nbsp;  outside the scope of this specification."<br>This is really confusing to me. I think this is what you need an actually data semantics aka type field for in the base header. Or is there an actual reason to not put this information directly in the base header where it is need but instead assuming some magical way this information may take to reach the node? If the assumption is that the SF is configured to know based of the SFI what the content of the context header has to be, you a) need to say that in the draft, and b) that's really error-prone because it's really hard to tell if the conext header actually holds the information that you need or just random crap (of course depending of the expected data type of this information). In short, I think you really need a type field somewhere here. In any case, you really need to explain this more!<br>Also, the text further says:<br>"An SF or SFC Proxy that does not know the format or semantics of the<br>&nbsp;  Context Header for an NSH with MD Type 1 MUST discard any packet with<br>&nbsp;  such an NSH..."<br>How does the SFC proxy know that it knows the format or not if there is no type field or identifier that indicates what the format should be?<br><br>Also, a related question from me: why is the context header present in all types of NSH if there is no use for it defined in this document yet? Why is there no fixed length NSH without a context header then?<br><br>3) Section 2.5.1:<br>"If multiple instances of the same metadata are included in an NSH<br>&nbsp;  packet, but the definition of that context header does not allow for<br>&nbsp;  it, the SFC-aware SF MUST process the first instance and ignore<br>&nbsp;  subsequent instances."<br>This seems error prone to me. If the same metadata appears multiple where it should not, that seems clearly like an error case for me. Just using the first one and proceed normally might not be the right thing to do. In any case I think such an occasion should at least be logged. If the multiple instances are just a copy of each other and carry the same information, it's probably okay to use that information and proceed. If the different instances carry different information, it maybe a bit dangerous to just use the first one and ignore others silently. In this case I would rather recommend to drop the packet...<br><br>4) In line with the second comment from the tsv-art review (thanks Wes!), I don't really understand why this documents says (sec 6) that there can be multiple next hops for the same SFP or SFs can be traversed in a different order. May understanding (from a quick look at <a href="/doc/rfc7665/">RFC7665</a>) would be that, if those things are needed e.g. for load balancing, then one should define different SFPs and the Classifier must have the knowledge that two SFP are equivalent and select them respectively. The reason why I'm really concerned about this is that usually a number of packets below to a flow and all packets belonging to the same flow just ideally take the same route. But usually only the Classifier has a notion of what a flow is and respectively will assign the SFI to the packets belonging to the same flow. If now any SF on the path can more or less randomly decided to forward packet belong to the same flow to one or another next nodes, I would assume that this is not only a problem for the flow, e.g. reordering, but also for SF itself in many cases.</div></td>

(Optional Variable Length Metadata) says that this document "does not make any assumption about Context Headers that are mandatory-to-implement or those that are mandatory-to-process.&nbsp; These considerations are deployment-specific."&nbsp; But the next couple of paragraphs specify explicit actions for them (mandatory-to-process):<br><br>&nbsp;  Upon receipt of a packet that belongs to a given SFP, if a mandatory-<br>&nbsp;  to-process context header is missing in that packet, the SFC-aware SF<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT process the packet and MUST log an error at least once per<br>&nbsp;  the SPI for which the mandatory metadata is missing.<br><br>&nbsp;  If multiple mandatory-to-process context headers are required for a<br>&nbsp;  given SFP, the control plane MAY instruct the SFC-aware SF with the<br>&nbsp;  order to consume these Context Headers.&nbsp; If no instructions are<br>&nbsp;  provided and the SFC-aware SF will make use of or modify the specific<br>&nbsp;  context header, then the SFC-aware SF MUST process these Context<br>&nbsp;  Headers in the order they appear in an NSH packet.<br><br>Maybe I'm confused about considerations being deployment specific vs specifying what to do here.&nbsp; Can you please clarify?<br><br><br>(3) "SFFs MUST use the Service Path Header for selecting the next SF or SFF in the service path."&nbsp; Section 6 explains most of what has to be done -- what I think is still not clear in this document is where the information in Tables 1-4 comes from.&nbsp; There may be different ways for an SFF to learn that, and I would imagine that it is out-of-scope of this document.&nbsp; Please say so -- maybe there's a relevant reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7665/">rfc7665</a> (?).<br><br><br>(4) Section 11.1.

The reader would have your intended applicability in mind much earlier and more clearly, and you could just invoke your expectations by reference when you need to explain how they apply elsewhere in the document, so the expectations in play would be consistent across mentions throughout the document.<br><br>I'm still bothered that this document doesn't explicitly mention ICMP blocking as a problem for PMTUD with IP encapsulations. We're just not good at path MTU discovery, so it seems useful to call this out explicitly when a document expects to use PMTUD. That way, people who use NSH will know to check for ICMP blocking on their networks before they receive their first trouble reports. This almost reached my threshold for balloting Discuss, so I'd hope you folks would consider that.<br><br>I see that the applicability of NSH includes encapsulations that don't provide a path MTU discovery mechanism, and that your resolution for those encapsulations is to log events when a "too big" packet is dropped. Could you educate me, as to whether all encapsulations detect that this is happening? It might be that encapsulations are using a fixed maximum MTU by definition, so that what you're logging is an attempt to send a payload that violates the protocol definition of the encapsulation, but I don't know that that's true in all cases, so thought I should ask.<br><br>I saw a suggestion from Joe Touch (in a response to the TSV-ART review) to consider looking at the terminology developed for draft-ietf-intarea-tunnels.
