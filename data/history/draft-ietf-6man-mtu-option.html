In addition, I'm dubious that operators will be willing to enable HbH processing to enable this mechanism, and, while this HbH option *itself* may be implementable in the fast-path, enabling processing of HbH to find this option seems likely to often require punting the packet, and may also make finding the L4 information harder.<br><br>Finally, I'm still not clear how exactly the signal should be interpreted next to other MTU mechanisms - if only a small number of devices actually implement and process this, it doesn't really remove the need for other mechanisms, and the performance hit for enabling it (and having HbH containing packets dropped) seems like it would likely outweigh the gains. <br><br>With all of that said, this *is* Experimental, and does mention many of my concerns. It also talks about applicability in "environments where there is control over the hosts and nodes that connect them", and so where operators may be willing to enable this because they know what sort of traffic exists. In addition, it's entirely possible that I'm wrong (I often am), and that this experiment will turn out to be wildly successful, and soon almost every router will do this -- and, if so, I'll be really happy!<br><br>In summary, I'm Abstaining, knowing that the document will progress, and hoping that it will be successful; ultimately, like most Abstains, it is a virtue-signaling no-op.</div></td>

The option type starts with 00, which §4.2/rfc8200 and §5 in this document define as "skip over this option and continue processing the header" (if the type is not recognized). In this case, the behavior is required, but this section only recommends (SHOULD) it.

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>&nbsp; Experimental.<br>&nbsp; We could have justed proposed for PS. If it's an experiment then this experiment COULD be short-lived and<br>&nbsp; successful if implemented and deployment experience&nbsp;  gained.<br>&nbsp; The reasons why this is an experiment, is that although the mechanism itself might be simple: <br>&nbsp; there are interactions between different layers needed to gain the benefit;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; and implementations would be needed in the network as well as the host; and finally there<br>&nbsp; could be changes needed in operational practice. That's something where a&nbsp;  little experience <br>&nbsp; might cause us to be able to specify/guide more. We don't know what that would be at this moment.<br>&nbsp; It would fail if no-one used it. At least in the transport area, we have tried to avoid<br>&nbsp; predicting the future - even to predict the timescale over which an experiment with <br>&nbsp; multiple parts might conclude. Although, if the WG later decides it fails, then the experiment<br>&nbsp; will surely become historic.<br>&nbsp; See also section 9 "Experiment Goals"<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option that is used to<br>&nbsp;  record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source<br>&nbsp;  host to a destination host.&nbsp; The recorded value can then be<br>&nbsp;  communicated back to the source using the return Path MTU field in<br>&nbsp;  the option.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; This document is the product of the 6man working group. It is a part of the ongoing effort of improving path MTU discovery in the Internet.<br>&nbsp; The mechanism described has been implemented as part of an IETF hackathon. It has undergone thorough review by multiple<br>&nbsp; working group participants. It is experimental as described above.<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>&nbsp; Making PMTUD work better is multi faceted and there are uncertainties in the WG regarding the deployability of this mechanism. That's also why it is experimental.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; There are multiple prototype implementations of this mechanism as described in the implementation section of the draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Ole Troan<br>&nbsp; Responsible Area Director: Erik Kline<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has implemented the mechanism described in this document.<br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has also reviewed the document in detail, both for language and technical issues over 3 iterations.<br>&nbsp; This work is part of chair's experiment to see if a much more thorough review at the working group level correlates<br>&nbsp; with fewer changes introduced by the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; This document has followed the 6MAN WG process with a WGLC to the list (28 responses) the volunteered<br>&nbsp; reviewers (Matt Smith/Michael Dougherty) and three thorough chair's / document shepherd reviews.<br>&nbsp; In addition Jen Linkova, Fernando Gont and Mark Smith has performed extensive reviews. See also<br>&nbsp; section 12 in the document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>&nbsp; This document and mechanism was initiated from a collaboration between the 6man and the transport working group.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>&nbsp; This is the first HBH option that can have Internet wide use(fullness).

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>&nbsp; This is the first HBH option that can have Internet wide use(fullness).

If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>&nbsp; Yes, there is an IPR filed.<br>&nbsp; Apart from the chair making the working group aware of the IPR, there has been no discussion of the IPR claims.<br>&nbsp; The WG does not believe it is in it's area to make conclusions about IPR claims.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; The document has solid consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>&nbsp; There are no nits.<br>&nbsp; The references to old documents are intentional.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>&nbsp; N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; Confirmed.<br>&nbsp; (The new HBH option described in the document has already a temporary allocation from IANA.)<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>&nbsp; No new IANA registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation?

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>This is the first HBH option that can have Internet wide use(fullness). The WG has certainly discussed at length if it is deployable. There is of course a feedback loop between a useful option with implementation and deployability / drop-rate in the Internet. There is significant uncertainty here, which is why we want to conduct this experiment. Can a notionally useful HBH option resolve the deadlock of Internet wide handling of HBH options? Secondarily can this option find a use within a limited domain?<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br></div></td>
