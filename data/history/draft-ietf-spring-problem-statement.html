The architecture document is<br>&nbsp; where those are promised. Which document is that?<br>&nbsp; Is it <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing/">draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing</a>?<br>&nbsp; So far, that doesn't seem to be there, so we should<br>&nbsp; expect more discussion to be needed if that remains<br>&nbsp; the case.<br>- You figure spring is ok-ish for MPLS, or at least no <br>&nbsp; worse than today, is that right?<br>- There is a need for a digital signature mechanism<br>&nbsp; (or similar) for the IPv6 data plane. In which document<br>&nbsp; would I find that? <br>&nbsp; Is it <a href="/doc/draft-previdi-6man-segment-routing-header/">draft-previdi-6man-segment-routing-header</a>?<br>&nbsp; If so, that seems to call for pre-shared keys, which<br>&nbsp; seems likely to be tricky, if we consider <a href="/doc/bcp107/">BCP107</a>. I<br>&nbsp; think we'll be heading for yet another discussion <br>&nbsp; of the need for automated key management here.<br><br>I'm ok with letting this document go ahead, but I do hope<br>the WG have substantive discussion of the above topics and<br>we don't leave that to IESG review of the documents<br>concerned.

Yet, 3.1.1 and 3.2 only say it “SHOULD” work without the addition of a signaling protocol. If any requirement is a “MUST”, it would seem this requirement needs to be a “MUST”. There is no need to make statements that RSVP-TE is complex and not scalable to justify. Just say simply you do not want to use a distributed control plane for your problem. This is not the first time for this requirement. As for no need for state at transit nodes, it’s not quite true, as there probably is a need to map the SR “label” to a label stack instruction and a forwarding instruction. Hint, the “MUST” would be similar to MPLS-TP requirements [<a href="/doc/rfc5654/">RFC5654</a>], “SPRING MUST support the capability for network operation without the use of any control-plane protocols.”<br><br>The interchangeability of the terms “SPRING” and “segment routing” are confusing. I think if you would clarify the control model, it may help with the definitions.<br><br>Section 1: “allow optimal virtualization by putting policy state in the packet header” and “policy is completely virtualized away from midpoints and tail-ends” doesn’t parse. By definition, it’s not “virtual” if it’s in the packet header. Seems to be a marketing statement, not a technical requirement.<br><br>Section 2: It seems the document is already defining the solution for IPv6 segment routing. It would help to say what is the actual requirement – packets should be forwarded transparently through a legacy v6 network? Identifiable by SPRING-capable devices?<br><br>Section 3: These use cases appear to be defining desired capabilities for a controller, not SPRING. It would be helpful to clarify what are the requirements for the dataplane’s “simple support” e.g. section 3.2 on FRR appears to be requirements on the controller, not the dataplane. And 3.3.1.2.1 on a capacity planning process in the controller.<br><br>Section 3.3 Traffic Engineering: While this is labelled Traffic Engineering, the examples are only on traffic placement. Only a subset of Traffic Engineering. The other key aspect of TE is resource reservation. The text should clarify and refer to traffic placement and not the general term “TE”.<br><br>Section 3.3.1.1 are all load balancing examples – not “TE”. While valid and useful, should not confuse the reader that it is TE.<br><br>Section 3.3.1.2.2 I don’t think everyone would agree that a stateful PCE is an SDN controller. I think there is some confusion, especially the next paragraph, on a controller vs. orchestrator. There’s a lot of marketing hype in this section, best would be to say something generic and what it is doing (technically) e.g. “centralized-based optimization” (next paragraph). The requirements in this section seem to be generic, not “SDN”. I don’t understand the last one, “no delay is introduced to programming the midpoints and tail-end along the path”. Compared to what? If a change, is there a change for traffic placement within the network? Before a change, there also is delay - the controller usually will sync with the current state of the network. This sounds marketing “highly responsive to change”. State the requirement for SPRING.<br><br>Missing requirements: OAM, any requirements on limiting the increased headers and overall frame size?</div></td>

It is one of a large number of active documents in the SPRING<br>WG, as listed at <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/spring/">https://tools.ietf.org/wg/spring/</a>. These include forays into solution space<br>(e.g. the IPv6 SRH, tagged as a 6man draft) and the SPRING architecture, which can<br>be found at <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-07">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-07</a>.<br><br>There is clearly significant interest in the IETF in developing the SR architecture(s) and<br>solutions.<br><br>The work in SPRING is already quite advanced, and thus one might query the value of<br>extensive effort in nailing down the problem statement and requirements. However, I<br>feel it is proper that the WG should ensure that the basis for their published solutions <br>has been through an appropriate consensus process, esp.&nbsp; should the rationale for <br>certain requirements need to be revisited in the future.<br><br>In that light, the document feels somewhat ânote formâ, in that requirements are scattered<br>through the discussed use cases, and many are not explained in any detail (presumably <br>as the authors assume certain level knowledge from those in the WG), e.g. what is meant<br>by âshared risk constraintsâ? The terminology could be better explained, for a broader<br>audience, and to reduce any potential ambiguity.<br><br>The requirements take the form of (depending on how you count them) 32 SHOULDs,<br>and there are, perhaps a little surprisingly, no MUSTs. Are the authors confident that <br>every SHOULD is just that, and that there are no mandatory requirements?<br><br>I might have queries over certain capabilities (implementations of requirements) in the<br>document, e.g. insertion / removal of IPv6 SRHs, but I think itâs better that this document <br>avoids drifting into discussing potential solution spaces.<br><br>The Security Considerations section is quite light, though it does contain one SHOULD.<br>I assume more detailed security discussion is to be contained in the solution documents,<br>although I note that the Security Considerations section of the architecture document is <br>also very brief.</div></td>

Firstly, I concur with Benoit's observation about text taken from the charter and laid in to the document verbatim. That tends not to help the reader and a large assumption is made that the reader understands the concerns of source based routing for partitioning VPNs, fast re-route, TE, signalling, and so on. Please consider rewriting the intro and other parts to help with understanding (for example in 3.2 Fast Reroute; microploop avoidance is listed as a requirement, however a sensible coverage of microloop avoidance is not found in the draft, nor in the nearby referenced spring-resiliency-use-cases). This also leaves me scratching my head as to why we don't see this document and the resiliency-use-cases (and others) at the same time when they are aligned? Or restructure the document to be more informative on these facets in the first case.<br><br>Can the document also be explicit that while the SPRING problem/solution space needs to be cognisant of autonomous systems that share policy/interoperate across boundaries the primary port of call is in regard to the IGP. This will certainly aide in restraining everyone (esp. the reader) from trying to boil the 'internet ocean'. (this at least should be easy to address :)</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Informational as indicated in the title page header.<br>This type of RFC is relevant for problem statement and requirements documents.<br><br>(2a) Technical Summary:<br><br>This document lists requirements and main use-cases to be considered in the design of architectures aimed at reaching the goals of the SPRING working group. <br><br>It highlights the importance of supporting both MPLS and IPv6 data-planes in SPRING solutions. <br><br>It provides a description of use cases (TE, FRR, Disjoint services, …) and associated requirements, illustrating the expected behavior of a network supporting such use cases. Detailed documents focusing on&nbsp; specific use-cases have been proposed to the WG (Resiliency, OAM), and this document refers to them (as informative references).<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>This document is actually a solution to a controversy at the early days of SPRING, where problem description and solutions were tied in single documents. <br><br>Debates on the content were numerous and vivid. After going back over all the threads related to this document, I found no items for which consensus was particularly rough. <br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is no protocol proposal in this document. <br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>A large number of vendors have supported the adoption of this draft. A large number of vendors co-author drafts proposing solutions to this problem statement. <br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? <br><br>Yakov Rekhter has provided substantial comments on the Spring ML, aimed at removing parts of the document that were still oriented towards a solution proposal.&nbsp; <br><br>If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>N/A<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Pierre Francois (myself). It was Alvaro Retana initially, but he became the responsible Area Director, and I inherited the Shepherding task.&nbsp; <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>Back in October 2014, the main concerns of the Document Shepherd (Alvaro Retana) were that some references were still made to an architecture proposal, although this document cannot pre-suppose that the working group works on an existing proposal. <br><br>The SPRING working group seems to be discussing and reaching consensus on a single proposal rather than letting multiple independent proposals compete, and I think it led the authors to making that mistake.&nbsp; This has been corrected since then. <br><br>A lot of terminology was used without reference and Alvaro insisted on this being solved, aside other editorial comments. These comments have been dealt with. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>I don’t see any.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes. All authors have declared they were not aware of any IPR related to this draft, on the Spring ML.&nbsp; <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document received strong support from many members of the WG (30+ support emails during call for WG adoption, after many discussions on its content). <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No. <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>No nits. <br><br>Outdated references: <br><br><a href="/doc/draft-geib-spring-oam-usecase/">I-D.geib-spring-oam-usecase</a> should be <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-oam-usecase/01/">draft-ietf-spring-oam-usecase-01</a><br><a href="/doc/draft-kumar-spring-sr-oam-requirement/">I-D.kumar-spring-sr-oam-requirement</a> should be <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-sr-oam-requirement/00/">draft-ietf-spring-sr-oam-requirement-00</a><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>I don’t think this applies to this doc.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No. All normative references are RFC’s. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>This document does no change the status of any existing RFC. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>This document does not request IANA allocations. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Informational as indicated in the title page header.<br>This type of RFC is relevant for problem statement and requirements documents.<br><br>(2a) Technical Summary:<br><br>This document lists requirements and main use-cases to be considered in the design of architectures aimed at reaching the goals of the SPRING working group. <br><br>It highlights the importance of supporting both MPLS and IPv6 data-planes in SPRING solutions. <br><br>It provides a description of use cases (TE, FRR, Disjoint services, …) and associated requirements, illustrating the expected behavior of a network supporting such use cases. Detailed documents focusing on&nbsp; specific use-cases have been proposed to the WG (Resiliency, OAM), and this document refers to them (as informative references).<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>This document is actually a solution to a controversy at the early days of SPRING, where problem description and solutions were tied in single documents. <br><br>Debates on the content were numerous and vivid. After going back over all the threads related to this document, I found no items for which consensus was particularly rough. <br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>There is no protocol proposal in this document. <br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>A large number of vendors have supported the adoption of this draft. A large number of vendors co-author drafts proposing solutions to this problem statement. <br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? <br><br>Yakov Rekhter has provided substantial comments on the Spring ML, aimed at removing parts of the document that were still oriented towards a solution proposal.&nbsp; <br><br>If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>N/A<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Pierre Francois (myself). It was Alvaro Retana initially, but he became the responsible Area Director, and I inherited the Shepherding task.&nbsp; <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>Back in October 2014, the main concerns of the Document Shepherd (Alvaro Retana) were that some references were still made to an architecture proposal, although this document cannot pre-suppose that the working group works on an existing proposal. <br><br>The SPRING working group seems to be discussing and reaching consensus on a single proposal rather than letting multiple independent proposals compete, and I think it led the authors to making that mistake.&nbsp; This has been corrected since then. <br><br>A lot of terminology was used without reference and Alvaro insisted on this being solved, aside other editorial comments. These comments have been dealt with. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>I don’t see any.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes. All authors have declared they were not aware of any IPR related to this draft, on the Spring ML.&nbsp; <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document received strong support from many members of the WG (30+ support emails during call for WG adoption, after many discussions on its content). <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No. <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>There is 1 instance of lines with private range IPv4 addresses in the document.&nbsp; If these are generic example addresses, they should be changed to use any of the ranges defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5735/">RFC 5735</a> (or successor): 192.0.2.x, 198.51.100.x or 203.0.113.x. <br><br>Outdated references: <br>A later version (-06) exists of <a href="/doc/draft-geib-spring-oam-usecase/04/">draft-geib-spring-oam-usecase-04</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>A later version (-11) exists of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution/10/">draft-ietf-idr-ls-distribution-10</a>&nbsp;  <br>A later version (-06) exists of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing/03/">draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-03</a><br><br><a href="/doc/draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp/">I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp</a> should be&nbsp; draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp-04.<br><a href="/doc/draft-kumar-spring-sr-oam-requirement/">I-D.kumar-spring-sr-oam-requirement</a> should be <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-sr-oam-requirement/00/">draft-ietf-spring-sr-oam-requirement-00</a><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>I don’t think this applies to this doc.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No. All normative references are RFC’s. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>This document does no change the status of any existing RFC. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>This document does not request IANA allocations. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>
