I'll also note that I was hoping to see "Implementation status report" in the draft, as mentioned in the shepherd writeup, and was disappointed not to find any.<br><br>However, I'd like to discuss a number of points, mostly on the IANA considerations and on detailed fields descriptions. I also want to bring 7. below regarding the IANA registries names to your attention, although it's not a hill I am willing to die on (that one is a "let's talk" DISCUSS, the rest I hope can be acted upon).<br><br>As noted in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/">https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/</a>, a DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion; I really think that the document would be improved with a change here, but can be convinced otherwise.<br><br><br>Francesca<br><br>1. -----<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>FP: The locator entries ASCII figure is not consistent with the descriptive text following it: specifically, Loc Size should follow Algorithm directly; instead, the picture seems to show there are 2 octets unused between Algorithm and Loc Size.<br><br>2. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: 5.<br><br>FP: For consistency (and to make sure implementers don't rely on the ASCII figure), it would be good to indicate Type's length (1 octet I assume).<br><br>3. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Length: variable.<br><br>FP: This does not help much understanding what this field is supposed to contain.<br><br>4. -----<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>FP: Same issue as in 1. for the ASCII figure.<br><br>5. -----<br><br>Sections 8.1 and 8.2<br><br>FP: Same comments as 1. 2. and 3.<br><br>6. -----<br><br>&nbsp; If a behavior is advertised it MUST<br>&nbsp;  only be advertised in the TLV[s] as indicated by "Y" in the table<br>&nbsp;  below, and MUST NOT be advertised in the TLV[s] as indicated by "N"<br>&nbsp;  in the table below.<br><br>FP: I find the sentence after the comma confusing, and don't understand the presence of the MUST NOT here.<br><br>7. -----<br><br>Section 11.1.1<br><br>FP: It sounds like a bad idea in general to have to rename the registry every time a TLV needs to be added to the registry... Maybe the wg and the AD should consider renaming the registries so not to have this sort of dependency. (I understand that this is a low priority comment, but still, it feels wrong to put in titles what would fit really well in a registry itself). This very much applies to Section 11.6 as well: the registry's name with the hierarchy of TLVs as part of the name feels like a really bad idea. That is typically data that goes into registries.<br><br>8. -----<br><br>Section 11.3<br><br>FP: The registry needs to be defined in the document. In particular, I see that IANA is interpreting the columns as "Value" "Description" "Reference"; is that right or should this be "Type" "Description" "Reference" (I see a mix of the two for different IANA registries)?<br><br>9. -----<br><br>Section 11.8<br><br>FP: Are bits 0, 2-15 reserved or unassigned? The terminology in section 2 is ambiguous, as it talks about "reserved for future use" (but the IANA section leaves them unassigned). Please clarify for IANA.<br><br>10. -----<br><br>Section 11.10<br><br>FP: Please define the registry (I assume it is going to be "Bit #", "Name", "Reference").</div></td>

The relationship of SRv6 SIDs to the IPv6 addressing<br>architecture (<a href="/doc/rfc4291/">RFC 4291</a>) was quite controversial during the processing of<br>what since became <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a>.&nbsp; I was able to reconcile the two at the time<br>by virtue of noting that the substructure of the SID can be considered<br>to be logically local to the node advertising the SID and therefore not<br>an observable part of the protocol.&nbsp; In that sense, the wire-visible use<br>and processing of SIDs remains that of normal IPv6 addresses.&nbsp; However,<br>introducing a sub-sub-TLV to specifically carry the structure of the SID<br>causes that reasoning to no longer apply, and seemingly re-opens the<br>question of whether the SID substructure is consistent with the IPv6<br>addressing architecture.&nbsp; In the absence of some compelling use case, I<br>cannot support publishing a mechanism that triggers this controversy.<br>Indeed, no motivating use case is presented in the document at all (the<br>usage is "outside of the scope of this document"), which invites<br>questions about why this mechanism should be defined in a<br>standards-track RFC at all (the relevant registry procedures are merely<br>"expert review").<br><br>COMMENT<br><br>(I agree with John that this doesn't inherently seem like an update to<br><a href="/doc/rfc7030/">RFC 7030</a>, but I have nothing further to add that he hasn't said already,<br>so let's keep that topic in his ballot thread.)<br><br>Thank you for noting (repeatedly) that multiple TLVs may be needed in<br>order to advertise all the SIDs for a given neighbor/endpoint/etc. --<br>the one-byte length field for TLVs is a bit cramped when we have 16-byte<br>SIDs!<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

Thus,<br>in a mixed network, if a prefix is advertised with both A- and N-flags<br>set, some nodes will treat it as identifying a node and other nodes will<br>treat it as an anycast address.&nbsp; Since this is inherently an error<br>situation (it violates the quoted "MUST NOT"), what is the benefit from<br>having the 'A' bit take precedence?&nbsp; It would seem equally valid, and<br>provide more uniform treatment across the network, to have the 'N' bit<br>take precedence in this case.&nbsp; (Though, given that the N flag is ignored<br>for non-host-prefixes, I guess the A flag would take precedence in some<br>cases anyway, so maybe it is not quite so simple.)<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;

Either “segment routing“ (remove “the“), or something like “the segment routing architecture“.<br><br>&nbsp;  called "segments".&nbsp; Segment routing architecture can be implemented<br><br>And here you do need “the“ in front of “segment”. <br><br>&nbsp;  over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane.&nbsp; This document<br><br>“An” -&gt; “the” (two places)<br><br>&nbsp;  over an IPv6 data plane.<br><br>“An” -&gt; “the”<br><br>&nbsp;  This documents updates <a href="/doc/rfc7370/">RFC 7370</a> by modifying an existing registry.<br><br>“Documents” -&gt; “document”<br><br>Also, this doesn’t seem to me like an update to <a href="/doc/rfc7370/">RFC 7370</a>. It’s normal for an RFC to update an IANA registry, without saying it updates a previous RFC that established that registry. I think the “updates” just confuses matters and clutters things up, and should be removed. <br><br>2. Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  This documents updates [<a href="/doc/rfc7370/">RFC7370</a>] by modifying an existing registry<br>&nbsp;  (Section 11.1.2).<br><br>“Documents” -&gt; “document”<br><br>See also comment #1 regarding update.<br><br>3. Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A non-zero SRH Max H.encaps MSD indicates that the headend can insert<br>&nbsp;  an SRH up to the advertised value.<br><br>“Up to the advertised value” doesn’t make sense. I guess you mean “can insert an SRH with up to the advertised number of SIDs”?<br><br>4. Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The Maximum End D MSD Type specifies the maximum number of SIDs<br>&nbsp;  present in an SRH when performing decapsulation.&nbsp; <br><br>That makes sense. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These includes, but<br>&nbsp;  not limited to, End.DX6, End.DT4, End.DT46, End with USD, End.X with<br>&nbsp;  USD as defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC8986</a>].<br><br>That doesn’t. How can a number include all those specific things? A number’s just an integer, right? Maybe you are providing some helpful context about the types of SIDs that are permitted to be present? If so, I expect this is specified elsewhere already, and this sentence is not helping; I would suggest removing it. If it does need to stay, it needs a rewrite for grammar and clarity. (Maybe you want something like “As specified in [<a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a>] the permitted SID types include, but are not limited to, .”)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the advertised value is zero or no value is advertised<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then the router cannot apply any behavior that results in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; decapsulation and forwarding of the inner packet if the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other IPv6 header contains an SRH.<br><br>What “other” IP header? Do you mean the outer header? The inner header? Something else?<br><br>5. Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  In cases where a locator advertisement is received in both a Prefix<br>&nbsp;  Reachability TLV and an SRv6 Locator TLV - (e.g. prefix, prefix-<br>&nbsp;  length, MTID all being equal and Algorithm being 0 in Locator TLV),<br><br>Since “e.g.” means “for example” you’re saying the thing in the parentheses is only one example of a locator advertisement received in both? What’s another example? (Maybe the algo being 1 in both cases?)<br><br>But in any case the text above appears redundant with the text that immediately follows. Can’t the text above be deleted?<br><br>&nbsp;  In case where the same prefix, with the same prefix-length, MTID, and<br>&nbsp;  algorithm is received in both a Prefix Reachability TLV and an SRv6<br>&nbsp;  Locator TLV, the Prefix Reachability advertisement MUST be preferred<br>&nbsp;  when installing entries in the forwarding plane.&nbsp; This is to prevent<br>&nbsp;  inconsistent forwarding entries between SRv6 capable and SRv6<br>&nbsp;  incapable routers.<br><br>“In case” -&gt; “in the case” or “in cases”<br><br>6. Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Supported behavior values together with parent TLVs in which they<br>&nbsp;  area advertised are specified in Section 10 of this document.&nbsp; Please<br><br>“Area” -&gt; “are”<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Length: variable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flags: 1 octet.&nbsp; No flags are currently defined.<br><br>When you write “length: variable“, I think you mean “length: a 1 octet field, whose value is variable“, don’t you? Just like you write “flags: 1 octet“? I get that the value placed into the length field is variable, but the way you’ve written it, it says that the length of the length field is itself variable, which would make no sense.<br><br>This is not the only place in the document you specify a length field this way, but I guess you should fix all of them. I’m only noting it here.<br><br>&nbsp;  The SRv6 End SID MUST be a subnet of the associated Locator.&nbsp; SRv6<br>&nbsp;  End SIDs which are not a subnet of the associated locator MUST be<br>&nbsp;  ignored.<br><br>Is a host route (which is what a SID is) technically a “subnet”? Can something which is not a net, be a subnet? It reads funny that way. If you change it, possibly “MUST be covered by the associated Locator“? (Although then for clarity you might need to define “covered“, which might not be any better.) (Same comment applies to Section 8 which also mentions “subnet”.)<br><br>7. Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  B-Flag: Backup flag.&nbsp; If set, the SID is eligible for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  protection (e.g., using IPFRR) as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8355/">RFC8355</a>].<br><br>Please expand IPFRR on first use. And since you say “e.g.” meaning “for example”, do you contemplate some other kind of protection which is not IPFRR? If not, I think you could delete the parenthesis without loss of clarity. <br><br>8. Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  SRv6 SID Structure Sub-Sub-TLV is used to advertise the as defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC8986</a>].&nbsp; It has the following format:<br><br>You’re missing something between “advertise the” and “as defined”. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Length: 4 octets.<br><br>Similar to my earlier comment, I think what you mean is something like “Length: a 1 octet field, whose value is 4”. <br><br>&nbsp;  associated with it.&nbsp; It's usage is outside of the scope of this<br>&nbsp;  document.<br><br>“It’s” -&gt; “its”<br><br>9. Section 11<br><br>&nbsp;  and sub-sub-TLVs as well updating the ISIS TLV registry and defining<br><br>“As well as”<br><br>&nbsp;  a new registry.<br><br>Doesn’t it define several new registries?<br><br>10.

Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  8126</a>).<br><br>The IANA section seems OK.
