From an editorial point of view most of this is discussed either in the intro text of section 6, then some part in 7.1, and some in the appendix C. I would really recommend you to instead have a separate section that much clearer states what should be done by default (probably no dynamically window but a small fixed window with maybe size of 1) and what could be don as further optimisation, and also to discuss the parameter/variables there before the algorithms are discussed.<br><br>And a bit of a provoking question: wouldn't it be easier to just use a reliable transport protocol on top?<br>If this mechanism is intended to be used over a short path with a few hops only (in a local network), I think this should be stated more clearly at the beginning of the document. <br>In the appendix you state this:<br>" In addition, deploying such a mechanism requires<br>&nbsp;  that the end-to-end transport is aware of the delivery properties of<br>&nbsp;  the underlying LLN,..."<br>But I'm not sure what you mean...? Can you further explain?<br><br><br><br>1) Sec 6:<br>"Upon exhaustion of the retries the<br>&nbsp;  sender may either abort the transmission of the datagram or retry the<br>&nbsp;  datagram from the first fragment with an 'X' flag set in order to<br>&nbsp;  reestablish a path and discover which fragments were received over<br>&nbsp;  the old path in the acknowledgment bitmap. "<br>I'm not sure about this "or". Why should the first fragment be more successful than any other which requests an ACK? Also if you really want to keep this condition, you need to specify it better. How often do you retry? I guess you need to set the PTO again...?<br>Further the RTO should also implement an exponential back-off.<br><br>2) sec 6.3:<br>"Upon an acknowledgment with a NULL bitmap, the sender endpoint<br>&nbsp;  MUST abort the transmission of the fragmented datagram with one<br>&nbsp;  exception: In the particular case of the first fragment, it MAY<br>&nbsp;  decide to retry via an alternate next hop instead."<br>What's mean with "In the particular case of the first fragment"? And does this mean it should retry only with the first fragment or the whole transmission. However, if this signal is from the receiving endpoint why should that endpoint change it mind only if a different path is used? If the assumption is that this NULL bitmap is sent by an intermediate node? However, then it would make sense to&nbsp; rather signal this information explicitly (e.g. using a flag).<br><br>3) Sec 7.1 (and to some extend sec 6)<br>"&nbsp;  OptWindowSize:&nbsp; The OptWindowSize is the value for the Window_Size<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that the sender should use to start with.&nbsp; It is greater than or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; equal to MinWindowSize.&nbsp; It is less than or equal to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MaxWindowSize.&nbsp; The Window_Size should be maintained below the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; number of hops in the path of the fragment to avoid stacking<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fragments at the bottleneck on the path.&nbsp; If an inter-frame gap is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to avoid interference between fragments then the Window_Size<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should be at most on the order of the estimation of the trip time<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; divided by the inter-frame gap."<br>This needs normative language and more explanation. I recommend to even say that if no congestion control (as discussed in the appendix) is applied, the Window MUST be set to 1.<br>Further, the assumption that the window can or should be set to (at maximum) the number of hop does seem correctly to me. No matter how many hops there are packets are only queued at the bottleneck (the link where the current rate is smaller than the sending rate) and it depends on the sending rate of the bottleneck link how many packets need to be queued. This is completely independent of the number of hops. Further, even if that would be true, as long as this document does not discuss also away to estimate or know the number of hops, this advise would unfortunately be useless...<br>Further I don't think pointing to <a href="/doc/rfc6298/">rfc6298</a> for RTT calculation is sufficient (as done in the appendix). <a href="/doc/rfc6298/">rfc6298</a> assume frequent ACKs and a reasonably large window, which is both not the case here.<br>All in all, any window adjustments itself are not described at all. What should be done when a congestion marking is received? How does the window need to be adjusted based on an RTO? When should the window be increased again? And how much?<br><br>4) Sec 7.1.: Inline with the TSV-ART review (Thanks Collin!), the parameters need more guidance.<br>Especially for he number of retries it should be possible to recommend a default value (e.g. 3) and it would be good to also give an upper limits (MUST NOT be larger than X).<br>Similar for the window size: there should be also at least a default value (see comment above).<br>And further the RTO needs further explanation about how to find a reasonable value. If the RTO is configured (and not estimated dynamically) e.g. it could be set to 3x the maximum expected RTT in the respective network. And it would be even better to provide a minimum default (initial) value. Not that TCP is also designed to work on a large variety of timescales and a minimum initial value of 1s is seen as safe for all Internet scenarios. It's really important to also provide some recommendations like this here.<br><br>5) Sec 7.2:<br>"The management system should monitor the number of retries and of ECN<br>&nbsp;  settings that can be observed from the perspective of both the sender<br>&nbsp;  and the receiver, and may tune the optimum size of Fragment_Size and<br>&nbsp;  of Window_Size, OptFragmentSize, and OptWindowSize, respectively, at<br>&nbsp;  the sender."<br>This does not see seem correct, as OptFragmentSize and OptWindowSize are the initial values which are configured and therefore should not be changed dynamically. Only Fragment_Size and Window_Size are changes. Further the network should also normatively state somewhere that Fragment_Size and Window_Size MUST not grow above the configured max value. That seems obvious but it's better to be explicit and use normative language respectively.<br><br>6) Further sec 7.2 says:<br>"The inter-frame gap is another tool that can be<br>&nbsp;  used to increase the spacing between fragments of the same datagram<br>&nbsp;  and reduce the ratio of time when a particular intermediate node<br>&nbsp;  holds a fragment of that datagram."<br>However, inter-frame gap is a configuration parameter and this is the first time that adapting it dynamically is mentioned here. If you want to adapt it dynamically you need to add more information.</div></td>

 The RFRAG Acknowledgment can optionally carry an ECN indication for<br>&nbsp;  flow control (see Appendix C).&nbsp; The receiver of a fragment with the<br>&nbsp;  'E' (ECN) flag set MUST echo that information by setting the 'E'<br>&nbsp;

 Fragments are sent in a round-robin fashion: the sender sends all the<br>&nbsp;  fragments for a first time before it retries any lost fragment; lost<br>&nbsp;  fragments are retried in sequence, oldest first.&nbsp;

I don't think it is significant as an intermediate node will in many other ways be able to interfere with the transmission of the fragments. However, it appears to me that the below formulation potentially allow a fragment sender to go into an interesting state by acknowledging fragments prior to even have received them, causing the sender to abort the transmission prematurely? <br><br>&nbsp;  When all the fragments are received, the receiving endpoint<br>&nbsp;  reconstructs the packet, passes it to the upper layer, sends an RFRAG<br>&nbsp;  Acknowledgment on the reverse path with a FULL bitmap, and arms a<br>&nbsp;  short timer, e.g., in the order of an average round-trip delay in the<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; As the timer runs, the receiving endpoint absorbs the<br>&nbsp;  fragments that were still in flight for that datagram without<br>&nbsp;  creating a new state.&nbsp; The receiving endpoint abort the communication<br>&nbsp;  if it keeps going on beyond the duration of the timer.<br><br>Could the author please comment on this aspect of what would occur in the fragment sender if it receives an RFRAG-ACK will full bitmap prior to having send all fragments, and also what would happen if this is received very shortly after having sent the last fragment?</div></td>

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br><br>Older versions of a precursor of this document existed as an individual submission discussed in the 6lowpan working group between 2008 and 2010, and were discussed again during the initial stages of the 6lo working group lifetime (e.g. at IETF 88). Some concerns were expressed at the time, such as potential interactions across layers. The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group again in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. This decision had good WG consensus, and no controversy has occurred since then regarding any of the three mentioned documents.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>One WG participant expressed on the mailing list that he was working on an implementation. His feedback contributed to improving the document.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Michel Veillette carried out a thorough review of the document before it became a 6lo wg document.<br>Laurent Toutain and Carles Gomez, both with a background in fragmentation in constrained node networks, did comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the document, based on revisions -02 and -03, which led to revisions -03 and -04.&nbsp; As a result of the shepherd (Carles Gomez) review, the document was again updated, leading to versions -05 and -06). Another WG participant provided comments in parallel, leading to the current version as of the writing (i.e. -07).<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Carles Gomez<br>Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>I first reviewed revision -03 of the document. My comments were addressed in version -04. As the shepherd, I reviewed again the document, and found few other issues more related with the shepherd write-up, which were addressed in -05 and -06. In my opinion, the document is now (-07) ready&nbsp; for IESG review. <br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: As mentioned in the response to question (2), Laurent Toutain and Carles Gomez performed comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the draft. Both reviewers have a background in fragmentation in constrained node networks. No other particular reviews were needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: The document author has confirmed that he is unaware of IPR on this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No IPRs found.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: as mentioned in the response to question (2), the consensus behind this document is solid, with the WG as a whole understanding and agreeing with it.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: One downref “error” has been identified (see the answer to question (15)). There are also comments from the idnits tool. The relevant details from the idnits tool output follow: <br>-- The document seems to lack a disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work, but may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have content which was first submitted before 10 November 2008.&nbsp; If you<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have contacted all the original authors and they are all willing to grant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP78</a> rights to the IETF Trust, then this is fine, and you can ignore<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  this comment.&nbsp; If not, you may need to add the pre-RFC5378 disclaimer. <br>-- The document date (April 2020) is 175 days in the future.&nbsp; Is this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  intentional?<br>** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational draft:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> (ref.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Yes, there is 1 downward normative reference, which is draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment. This reference is an informational document located in the normative references subsection. In fact, this reference qualifies as a document that “must be read to understand or implement the technology in the new RFC, or whose technology must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references">https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references</a>). <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: this document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>, as listed on the title page header, mentioned in the Abstract and explained in the Introduction (although the verb “update” is not used in the latter). Section 3 is entitled “Updating <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>”. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>The document defines 2 new 6LoWPAN Dispatch types (and allocates 4 values) in Page 0 from the "Dispatch Type Field" registry (<a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc8025/">RFC 8025</a>). Section 9 of the document, entitled "IANA considerations", details the IANA actions needed. The actions requested from IANA are appropriate from the point of view of the shepherd.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Not applicable as there are no formal language constructs in the document.<br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a> with a simple protocol to recover<br>&nbsp;  individual fragments across a route-over mesh network, with a minimal<br>&nbsp;  flow control to protect the network against bloat.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br><br>Older versions of a precursor of this document existed as an individual submission discussed in the 6lowpan working group between 2008 and 2010, and were discussed again in the initial stages of the 6lo working group lifetime (e.g. at IETF 88). Some concerns were expressed at the time, such as potential interactions across layers. The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group again in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. This decision had good WG consensus, and no controversy has occurred since then regarding any of the three mentioned documents.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>One WG participant expressed on the mailing list that he was working on an implementation. His feedback contributed to improving the document.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Michel Veillette carried out a thorough review of the document before it became a 6lo wg document.<br>Laurent Toutain and Carles Gomez, both with a background in fragmentation in constrained node networks, did comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the document, based on revisions -02 and -03, which led to revisions -03 and -04.&nbsp; As a result of the shepherd (Carles Gomez) review, the document was again updated, leading to the current version as of the writing (i.e. -05).<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Carles Gomez<br>Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>I first reviewed revision -03 of the document. My comments were addressed in version -04. As the shepherd, I reviewed again the document, and found few other issues more related with the shepherd write-up, which were addressed in -05. In my opinion, the document is now ready for IESG review. <br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: As mentioned in the response to question (2), Laurent Toutain and Carles Gomez performed comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the draft. Both reviewers have a background in fragmentation in constrained node networks. No other particular reviews were needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: The document author has confirmed that he is unaware of IPR on this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No IPRs found.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: as mentioned in the response to question (2), the consensus behind this document is solid, with the WG as a whole understanding and agreeing with it.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Two downref “errors” have been identified (see the answer to question (15)). There are also warnings and comments from the idnits tool. The relevant details from the idnits tool output follow: <br> -- The document seems to lack a disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work, but may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have content which was first submitted before 10 November 2008.&nbsp; If you<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have contacted all the original authors and they are all willing to grant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP78</a> rights to the IETF Trust, then this is fine, and you can ignore<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  this comment.&nbsp; If not, you may need to add the pre-RFC5378 disclaimer.&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; -- The document date (July 22, 2019) is 90 days in the past.&nbsp; Is this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  intentional?<br>&nbsp; == Outdated reference: A later version (-04) exists of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/02/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-02</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational draft:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> (ref.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Yes, there are 2 downward normative references, which are <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> and draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly. These references are informational documents that are located in the normative references subsection. In fact, these references qualify as documents that “must be read to understand or implement the technology in the new RFC, or whose technology must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references">https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references</a>). <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: this document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>, as listed on the title page header, mentioned in the Abstract and explained in the Introduction (although the verb “update” is not used in the latter). Section 3 is entitled “Updating <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>”. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>The document defines 2 new 6LoWPAN Dispatch types (and allocates 4 values) in Page 0 from the "Dispatch Type Field" registry (<a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc8025/">RFC 8025</a>). Section 9 of the document, entitled "IANA considerations", details the IANA actions needed. The actions requested from IANA are appropriate from the point of view of the shepherd.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Not applicable as there are no formal language constructs in the document.<br></div></td>

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>Shepherd response: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br>Shepherd response: One downref “error” has been identified (see the answer to question (15)). There are also warnings and comments from the idnits tool. The relevant details from the idnits tool output follow: <br>&nbsp; -- The document seems to lack a disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work, but may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have content which was first submitted before 10 November 2008.&nbsp; If you<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  have contacted all the original authors and they are all willing to grant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP78</a> rights to the IETF Trust, then this is fine, and you can ignore<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  this comment.&nbsp; If not, you may need to add the pre-RFC5378 disclaimer. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (See the Legal Provisions document at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info">https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info</a> for more information.)<br>&nbsp; -- The document date (June 11, 2019) is 36 days in the past.&nbsp; Is this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  intentional?<br>&nbsp; == Outdated reference: A later version (-02) exists of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/01/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-01</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational draft:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> (ref.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>Shepherd response: No. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br>Shepherd response: Yes, there is one downward normative reference, which is draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment. This reference is an informational document that is located in the normative references subsection. In fact, this reference qualifies as a document that “must be read to understand or implement the technology in the new RFC, or whose technology must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work” (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references">https://www.ietf.org/blog/iesg-statement-normative-and-informative-references</a>). <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>Shepherd response: this document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>, as listed on the title page header, mentioned in the Abstract and explained (although the verb “update” is not used) in the Introduction. Section 3 is entitled “Updating <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC 4944</a>”. <br>On the other hand, Section 4 is entitled “Updating <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a>”. The <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> document is not currently an RFC, although it is currently being processed in parallel with the fragment recovery draft that is the object of this writeup. Note that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment/">draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment</a> is not listed on the title page header, and not mentioned in the abstract or the introduction. However, it is mentioned in Section 2.4 and in Section 4.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br>Shepherd response: <br>The document defines 2 new 6LoWPAN Dispatch types from Page 0 (<a href="/doc/rfc8025/">RFC 8025</a>). The&nbsp; details for IANA actions needed are clearly presented in Section 5, whereas the “IANA considerations” section only mentions that extensions are needed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.
