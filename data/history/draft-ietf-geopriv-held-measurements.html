If there is an implicit <br>statement that location information is distributed in a privacy-safe <br>way, then you are probably saying that the measurement information is<br>less privacy-sensistive and could be distributed in a less privacy-safe<br>way.

That said, I have a number of<br>specific discuss points - some of 'em should be very easy<br>to clear, so don't be put off that there's so many. There<br>may also be some that can be cleared based on a bit more<br>text describing the schema, which I didn't go over fully.<br><br>(1) I think this draft needs to say that a device MUST<br>include some interface(s) that allows for user or sysadmin<br>control over what measurements will be sent and to whom. I<br>don't think that can be done in a single sentence so I'm<br>not sure right now how to fix this. You may argue that<br>those controls are elsewhere in the geopriv set of RFCs,<br>but I didn't see any references that helped me on this. So<br>putting this as a question: how is an implementer supposed<br>to know when to just send a requested measurement and when<br>to not send some?&nbsp; (If all implementers just make this up,<br>then the only way to get good interop seems to be if all<br>coders send all the measurements that they can all the<br>time.)<br><br>(2) There are a bunch of IPR declarations on this. I didn't<br>see where the WG had discussed those. Can someone point me<br>at the relevant bit of WG archive or minutes? I did see<br>discussion on IPR related to 4119 but I've no idea if<br>that's the same thing or not. I'm also not clear if the 4<br>declarations are really one or not, but I expect the WG<br>know, so I'm just checking that the WG did consider all<br>that and were ok to proceed. (The write-up says there is<br>one disclosure and that was discussed, but I see 4, hence<br>the question, maybe its just the writeup or maybe all 4 are<br>really one thing, I dunno.)<br><br>(3) section 3 says: "Use of location-related measurement<br>data is at the discretion of the LIS" - that's ambiguous<br>and in a possibly bad way. I think you mean that the LIS<br>can use the data its given in order to estimate a location<br>using any algorithm. There are two ambiguities in how its<br>stated though: a) it might be read as saying that the LIS<br>is in charge of telling the Device what location-related<br>measurements are to be supplied, and b) it might be read as<br>saying that the LIS can do whatever it wants with the<br>measurements, e.g. send all measurements off to big brother<br>for archiving or to a marketing company without asking.<br>Both a) and b) should be stated as not being at the<br>discretion of the LIS and the statement ought be<br>unambiguous.<br><br>(4) 4.1.2: What does "MUST NOT keep" mean? If the request<br>containing the measurements was logged has the LIS "kept"<br>the measurement?&nbsp; I think you need to be clear on that. I'd<br>prefer if you said it means yes, the measurements MUST NOT<br>be logged. But will implementers really do that? If not,<br>then it seems that the draft is at least a bit misleading.<br><br>(5) 4.3: could a compromised LIS mount a nice DoS on a<br>network by asking a lot of devices to make many<br>measurements that impact on those devices but maybe also on<br>the n/w as a whole? Is that threat noted?&nbsp; Should you<br>RECOMMEND that devices have some way to sanity check what<br>they're asked to do by/for a LIS?<br><br>(6) 5.1, if LLDP measurements expose IP addressing then<br>that may a) expose topology information that a sys admin<br>would rather hide and b) involve sending private IP<br>addresses over the public Internet. Don't you need to note<br>those issues and say how to deal with them? You do approach<br>saying that in section 6/7 but I think you need to be more<br>explicit and say which pieces of measurement information<br>are sensitive in which ways (e.g. by adding a list of them)<br>so that implementers can get this right.&nbsp; As-is, I don't<br>think there's enough information in the draft for coders to<br>do a good job.<br><br>(7) 5.2, (just checking) - aren't there models for using<br>DHCP where the subscriber-id is considered sensitive<br>information? I seem to recall some cases like that but<br>didn't check. Did you? <br><br>(8) 5.2, if I tell the LIS my DHCP relay/server address<br>doesn't that allow the LIS to start pretending to be that<br>DHCP server in some networks? I didn't see that noted in<br>section 7.<br><br>(9) 5.3, Why is so much information about an AP allowed to<br>be sent? Why is that all needed?&nbsp; <br><br>(10) section 6, why don't you say that measurement data<br>MUST be afforded the same protection as location<br>information and then say what that means for interop, e.g.<br>that if location data has to go via TLS, then so MUST<br>measurement data?<br><br>(11) 6.1, "No entity is permited to redistribute<br>measurement data" also needs a MUST NOT I think, as in "A<br>LIS MUST NOT redistribute measurement data." But then in<br>6.2 you (twice) say "unless directed to do so by the<br>Device" - I didn't get how a device can do that?<br><br>(12) 6.3 - I just want to check since I don't think I get<br>the implications. When would a device request a location<br>URI? What does "use the measurement data in serving<br>requests" mean? If it means, use the measurements to<br>generate the URI and location information that seems ok<br>(modulo the 1st question). If it means "also expose the<br>measurement when the location URI is de-referenced" that'd<br>be problematic I think.<br><br>(13) 6.4 - I don't understand how the "MUST be trusted" by<br>the LIS thing works. Can you explain?&nbsp; And if that's not<br>covered here, where it it specified?&nbsp; Otherwise how can it<br>be implemented so as to achieve interop?<br><br>(14) 7.1 - why are threats caused by a LIS revealing<br>location measurements or location information not part of<br>the threat model?<br><br>(15) 7.1.1 - I don't get this - are you saying that knowing<br>measurement data alone is enough to convince any LIS to<br>hand over location information? That would seem fatal if<br>true so I must be missing something.<br><br>(16) 7.2.1 to 7.2.3 - what are the mitigations here that I<br>can implement? I don't see 'em.<br><br>(17) 7.2.4 - this has a MUST saying to put "trusted"<br>location information first, but doesn't say how to decide<br>if location information is trusted or not so how can I<br>implement that MUST?<br><br>(18) 7.2.5 - I don't understand what "stateful examination"<br>might mean here so how can I implement something? Can you<br>clarify what you mean?</div></td>

information that is available due to<br>&nbsp;  the knowledge about the network and physical environment that is<br>&nbsp;  available to the LIS.<br><br>The semicolon is the wrong punctuation for that: a comma will work, or perhaps a colon, but not a semicolon.&nbsp; But anyway, it's an odd sentence.&nbsp; The first part is too obvious to mention.&nbsp; How about this?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  A location information server (LIS) is the server that<br>&nbsp;  provides location information that is available due to the<br>&nbsp;  knowledge it has about the network and physical environment.<br><br>(or I might say "...that is derivable from the knowledge...").<br><br>&nbsp;  As a part of the access network, the LIS is able to acquire<br>&nbsp;  measurement results from network Devices within the network that are<br>&nbsp;  related to Device location.<br><br>This looks like it's the Devices that are related to Device location.&nbsp; I think you mean that the measurement results are related to Device location.&nbsp; Try this:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  As a part of the access network, the LIS is able to acquire,<br>&nbsp;  from network Devices within the network, measurement results that<br>&nbsp;  are related to the locations of those Devices.<br><br>I would also remove the "However," at the end of the paragraph.<br><br>-- Section 3 --<br>&nbsp;  Measurement data that the LIS does not support or understand can be<br>&nbsp;  ignored.<br><br>This is a sentence that just screams for active voice: is there any entity that would ignore it other than the LIS?<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The LIS can ignore measurement data it does not support or understand.<br><br>-- Section 4 --<br>&nbsp;  In the HELD protocol, the inclusion of a measurement request in an<br>&nbsp;  error response with a code of "locationUnknown" indicates that the<br>&nbsp;  LIS believes that providing the indicated measurements would increase<br>&nbsp;  the likelihood of a subsequent request being successful.<br><br><br>Someone recently said, "Servers hate to be anthropomorphized."&nbsp; I don't think any location information server *believes* anything.&nbsp; Maybe remove "the LIS believes that"?&nbsp; And maybe also avoid two consecutive uses of "indicate" while you're about it?<br><br><br>-- Section 5.3.1 --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The "parameter" element identifies an optional<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; measurements are requested for each measured access point.<br><br>You have a number disagreement and what appears to be a missing word; please fix this sentence.<br><br>-- Section 5.4 --<br>&nbsp;  Cellular Devices are common throughout the world and base station<br>&nbsp;  identifiers can provide a good source of coarse location information.<br>&nbsp;  This information can be provided to a LIS run by the cellar operator,<br>&nbsp;  or may be provided to an alternative LIS operator that has access to<br>&nbsp;  one of several global cell-id to location mapping databases.<br><br>The second sentence mentions the "cellar operator".&nbsp; Perhaps too much wine was involved, which could explain a lot.&nbsp; The second sentence starts with "This information", which appears to refer to the "coarse location information."&nbsp; But I think, from the rest of the sentence, that you mean it to refer to the "base station identifiers".&nbsp; If that's so, the sentence should start with "These identifiers can be provided".<br><br>-- Section 7 --<br>&nbsp;  A Device that provides location location-related measurement data<br>&nbsp;  might use data to:<br><br>You're one short: the punch line to the old joke is "Location, location, location."<br><br>-- Section 7.1.2 --<br>&nbsp;  Allowing requests with measurements might be used to collect<br>&nbsp;  information about a network topology.&nbsp; This is possible if requests<br>&nbsp;  containing measurements are permitted.<br><br>As "allow" and "permit" are synonyms, I bet you can see how these two sentences don't go together.<br><br>-- Section 7.1.3 --<br>Another sentence that needs some fixing:<br><br>&nbsp;  Some types of measurement data are relatively easy to falsify in a<br>&nbsp;  way that the resulting location information to be selected with<br>&nbsp;  little or no error.<br><br>You're doing a lot of repeating in this section:<br><br>&nbsp;  An attacker gains if they are able to coerce the LIS into providing<br>&nbsp;  location information based on falsified measurement data and that<br>&nbsp;  information can be attributed to the LIS.<br><br>Some variation on that is stated in paragrahs 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.&nbsp; They don't all say exactly the same thing, of course, but I found myself saying, "Yes, they said that already," and then, "THEY SAID THAT ALREADY!"&nbsp; Please have a look through here and see how you might better organize Section 7.1.3 to minimize that effect.&nbsp; (Along the same line, I'll note that paragraph 8 says exactly the same thing twice.)<br><br>-- Section 7.1.5 --<br><br>&nbsp;  Some types of measurement data can be altered or influenced by a<br>&nbsp;

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>The type of RFC being requested is Proposed Standard. Proposed Standard is appropriate because this document defines an extension to a current Proposed Standard RFC (<a href="/doc/rfc5985/">RFC 5985</a>). The title page header indicates that the document is to be Standards Track.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-<br>related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location<br>information. Location-related measurement information are<br>observations concerning properties related to the position of a<br>Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the<br>physical environment. When a LIS generates location information for<br>a Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the<br>location estimate. A basic set of location-related measurements are<br>defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as<br>assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There is strong consensus around this document in the working group. It is required for the HELD protocol to meet many use cases that are satisfied with proprietary protocols today.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are a few existing prototype implementations of the protocol. Prototype implementations were deployed at a few IETF meetings. The document references standards from several other SDOs, so the authors solicited reviews by experts on the relevant standards. The document has been updated to the satisfaction of those experts.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The Document Shepherd is Alissa Cooper.<br>The responsible Area Director is Richard Barnes.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I have reviewed this document, and find it clear and implementable.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>I do not have concerns about the depth or breadth of review that has been performed.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>This document defines new XML data structures, and extends the HELD schema (<a href="/doc/rfc5985/">RFC 5985</a>). It has not been reviewed by the XML directorate, but its use of XML is straightforward enough that I do not believe a review to be necessary.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>I do not have any specific concerns.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that all relevent IPR disclosures have been filed.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>One IPR disclosure has been filed against this document. There was some discussion of the disclosure, and the WG agreed that it should not be blocking for this document.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is strong consensus for this document. Several WG participants have expressed the opinion that it address a necessary use case.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>There are no threatened appeals.<br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>There are a few reference issues that need to be fixed: the <a href="/doc/rfc20/">RFC 0020</a> reference should be removed, and the ASCII reference does not display properly. Otherwise, the document has no nits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>This document does not require any formal reviews.<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes. References are divided into normative and informative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>There are no such references.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no such references.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document's IANA Considerations section correctly registers all parameters required by the document.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The document creates a new IANA registry for GNSS types, operating under "Specification Required" rules. As the registration space is not a scarce resource, the bar for the designated expert's expertise need not be especially high. The designee need not be an expert in GNSS systems; the key is to find someone capable of detecting unsubtle attempts at fraud or obvious duplication.<br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>I have validated that all XML schemas are valid, and all XML examples are well-formed, using the W3C online XML validator.</div></td>
