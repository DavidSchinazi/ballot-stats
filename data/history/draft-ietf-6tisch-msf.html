I wonder if it would be easier on the<br>reader to consolidate this as a general principle and not repeat the<br>details every time it occurs.<br><br>Requirements Language<br><br>"NOT RECOMMENDED" is not in the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> boilerplate (but is a <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> keyword).<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;

 It does so for 3 reasons: to match the link-layer resources to the<br>&nbsp;  traffic, to handle changing parent, to handle a schedule collision.<br><br>nit: end the list with "or" (or "and"?).<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF works closely with RPL, specifically the routing parent defined<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; This specification only describes how MSF works with<br>&nbsp;  one routing parent, which is phrased as "selected parent".&nbsp; The<br><br>nit: I suggest '''one routing parent; this parent is referred to as the<br>"selected parent"'''.<br><br>&nbsp;  activity of MSF towards to single routing parent is called as a "MSF<br><br>nit: "towards the"<br><br>&nbsp;

 MSF uses the minimal cell for broadcast frames such as Enhanced<br>&nbsp;  Beacons (EBs) [IEEE802154] and broadcast DODAG Information Objects<br>&nbsp;  (DIOs) [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; Cells scheduled by MSF are meant to be used only<br>&nbsp;  for unicast frames.<br><br>If this paragraph was moved before the previous paragraph, then EB and<br>DIO would be defined before their first usage.<br><br>&nbsp;  bandwidth of minimal cell.&nbsp; One of the algorithm met the rule is the<br>&nbsp;  Trickle timer defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC6206</a>] which is applied on DIO messages<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; However, any such algorithm of limiting the broadcast<br><br>nit(?): "One of the algorithms that fulfills this requirement"?<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF RECOMMENDS the use of 3 slotframes.&nbsp; MSF schedules autonomous<br>&nbsp;  cells at Slotframe 1 (Section 3) and 6P negotiated cells at Slotframe<br>&nbsp;  2 (Section 5) , while Slotframe 0 is used for the bootstrap traffic<br>&nbsp;  as defined in the Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED to<br>&nbsp;  use the same slotframe length for Slotframe 0, 1 and 2.&nbsp; Thus it is<br><br>Perhaps this is just a question of writing style, but if an<br>implementation is free to use an alternative SF or a variant of MSF,<br>could we not say that "MSF uses 3 slotframts", "MSF uses the same<br>slotframe length for", etc.?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Is there any risk of unwanted correlation between slot and channel<br>offsets when using the same hash function and input for both<br>calculations?<br><br>&nbsp;  hash function.&nbsp; Other optional parameters defined in SAX determine<br>&nbsp;  the performance of SAX hash function.&nbsp; Those parameters could be<br>&nbsp;  broadcasted in EB frame or pre-configured.&nbsp; For interoperability<br>&nbsp;  purposes, an example how the hash function is implemented is detailed<br>&nbsp;  in Appendix B.<br><br>Given the lack of usable reference for [SAX-DASFAA], I assume that the<br>content in Appendix B is going to be used as a specification, not just<br>an example.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The AutoRxCell MUST always remain scheduled after synchronized.<br><br>nit: s/synchronized/synchronization/<br><br>&nbsp;  AutoRxCell.&nbsp; In case of conflicting with a negotiated cell,<br>&nbsp;  autonomous cells take precedence over negotiated cell, which is<br>&nbsp;  stated in [IEEE802154].&nbsp; However, when the Slotframe 0, 1 and 2 use<br>&nbsp;  the same length value, it is possible for negotiated cell to avoid<br>&nbsp;  the collision with AutoRxCell.<br><br>Presumably this factors in to the recommendation to have the three<br>listed slotframes use the same length, but mentioning it explicitly<br>(whether here or where the recommendation is made) might be nice.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

 While the exact behavior is implementation-specific, it is<br>&nbsp;  RECOMMENDED that after having received the first EB, a node keeps<br>&nbsp;  listen for at most MAX_EB_DELAY seconds until it has received EBs<br>&nbsp;  from NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT distinct neighbors, which is defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>].<br><br>nit(?): this phrasing implies that only NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT is<br>defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC 8180</a>, but MAX_EB_DELAY is also defined there.<br><br>not-nit: this phrasing is ambiguous as to whether one of MAX_EB_DELAY<br>and NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT is sufficient to move to the next step or<br>whether both are required.<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  After selected a JP, a node generates a Join Request and installs an<br>&nbsp;  AutoTxCell to the JP.&nbsp; The Join Request is then sent by the pledge to<br>&nbsp;  its JP over the AutoTxCell.&nbsp; The AutoTxCell is removed by the pledge<br><br>editorial: I'd suggest s/its JP/its selected JP/<br><br>&nbsp;  Response is sent out.&nbsp; The pledge receives the Join Response from its<br>&nbsp;  AutoRxCell, thereby learns the keying material used in the network,<br>&nbsp;  as well as other configurations, and becomes a "joined node".<br><br>nit: maybe "other configuration values" or "other configuration<br>settings"?<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Once it has selected a routing parent, the joined node MUST generate<br>&nbsp;  a 6P ADD Request and install an AutoTxCell to that parent.&nbsp; The 6P<br>&nbsp;  ADD Request is sent out through the AutoTxCell with the following<br>&nbsp;  fields:<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CellOptions: set to TX=1,RX=0,SHARED=0<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; NumCells: set to 1<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CellList: at least 5 cells, chosen according to Section 8<br><br>Is this listing describing the contents of the ADD request or the<br>AuthTxCell used to send it?&nbsp; (I presume the former, in which case I<br>suggest to use "containing" or similar in preference to "with".)<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The goal of MSF is to manage the communication schedule in the 6TiSCH<br>&nbsp;  schedule in a distributed manner.&nbsp; For a node, this translates into<br>&nbsp;  monitoring the current usage of the cells it has to the selected<br>&nbsp;  parent:<br><br>Is this goal strictly limited to traffic "to the selected parent" vs.<br>all traffic?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; If the node determines that the number of link-layer frames it is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attempting to exchange with the selected parent per unit of time<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is larger than the capacity offered by the TSCH negotiated cells<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it has scheduled with it, the node issues a 6P ADD command to that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parent to add cells to the TSCH schedule.<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; If the traffic is lower than the capacity, the node issues a 6P<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DELETE command to that parent to delete cells from the TSCH<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; schedule.<br><br>As written, this would potentially lead to oscillation when demand is<br>basically at capacity, due to the quantization of capacity.&nbsp; Perhaps<br>some provisioning for hysteresis is appropriate?<br><br>&nbsp;  The cell option of cells listed in CellList in 6P Request frame<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD be either Tx=1 only or Rx=1 only.&nbsp; Both NumCellsElapsed and<br>&nbsp;  NumCellsUsed counters can be used to both type of negotiated cells.<br><br>Would this be more clear as "(Tx=1,Rx=0) or (Tx=0,Rx=1)"?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; NumCellsElapsed is incremented by exactly 1 when the current cell<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is AutoRxCell.<br><br>This holds for all peers/parents we're keeping counters for, so the<br>AutoRxCell can get "double counted"?<br><br>&nbsp;  In case that a node booted or disappeared from the network, the cell<br>&nbsp;  reserved at the selected parent may be kept in the schedule forever.<br>&nbsp;  A clean-up mechanism MUST be provided to resolve this issue.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  clean-up mechanism is implementation-specific.&nbsp; It could either be a<br>&nbsp;  periodic polling to the neighbors the nodes have negotiated cells<br>&nbsp;  with, or monitoring the activities on those cells.&nbsp; The goal is to<br>&nbsp;  confirm those negotiated cells are not used anymore by the associated<br>&nbsp;  neighbors and remove them from the schedule.<br><br>I'm not sure that "monitoring the activities on those cells" is safe<br>with the current level of specification; if a node negotiates a 6P<br>transmit cell to a parent and uses it only sparingly, with the parent<br>eventually reclaiming it due to inactivity, I don't see a mechanism by<br>which the node will reliably discover the negotiated cell to be<br>nonfunctional and fall back to (e.g.) the corresponding AutoTxCell.&nbsp; It<br>may be most prudent to just not mention that as an example (a "periodic<br>polling" procedure does not seem to have the same potential for<br>information skew)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  schedule is executed and the node sends frames to that parent.&nbsp; When<br>&nbsp;  NumTx reaches MAX_NUMTX, both NumTx and NumTxAck MUST be divided by<br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; For example, when MAX_NUMTX is set to 256, from NumTx=255 and<br>&nbsp;  NumTxAck=127, the counters become NumTx=128 and NumTxAck=64 if one<br>&nbsp;  frame is sent to the parent with an Acknowledgment received.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  operation does not change the value of the PDR, but allows the<br>&nbsp;  counters to keep incrementing.&nbsp; The value of MAX_NUMTX is<br>&nbsp;  implementation-specific.<br><br>Does MAX_NUMTX need to be a power of two (to avoid errors when the<br>division occurs)?<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; For any other cell, it compares its PDR against that of the cell<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  with the highest PDR.&nbsp; If the difference is larger than<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RELOCATE_PDRTHRES, it triggers the relocation of that cell using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a 6P RELOCATE command.<br><br>The recommended RELOCATE_PDRTHRES is given as "50 %".&nbsp; Is this<br>"difference" performed as a subtraction (so that if the highest PDR is<br>less than 50%, no cells can ever be relocated) or a ratio (a PDR that's<br>half than the maximum PDR or smaller will trigger relocation)?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Maybe reference Section 17.1 where the allocation will occur?<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The slotOffset of a cell in the CellList SHOULD be randomly and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uniformly chosen among all the slotOffset values that satisfy the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; restrictions above.<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The channelOffset of a cell in the CellList SHOULD be randomly and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uniformly chosen in [0..numFrequencies], where numFrequencies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; represents the number of frequencies a node can communicate on.<br><br>Do these random selections need to be independent from each other?&nbsp; (I<br>note that the selection for the autonomous cells are not.)<br><br>Section 9<br><br>Is there a reference for these three parameters (MAXBE, MAXRETRIES,<br>SLOTFRAME_LENGTH)?&nbsp; SLOTFRAME_LENGTH seems new in this document and is<br>listed in the table in Section 14, but the other two are not listed<br>there.<br><br>Section 14<br><br>Why is MAX_NUMTX not listed in the table?<br><br>Can we really give a recommended NUM_CH_OFFSET value, since this is in<br>effect dependent on the number of channels available?<br><br>KA_PERIOD is defined but not used elsewhere in the document.<br><br>What are the considerations in using a power of 10 vs. a power of 2 as<br>MAX_NUM_CELLS?<br><br>Section 16<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF defines a series of "rules" for the node to follow.&nbsp; It triggers<br>&nbsp;  several actions, that are carried out by the protocols defined in the<br>&nbsp;  following specifications: the Minimal IPv6 over the TSCH Mode of IEEE<br>&nbsp;  802.15.4e (6TiSCH) Configuration [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>], the 6TiSCH Operation<br><br>I'd suggest a brief note that the security considerations of those<br>protocols continue to apply (even though it ought to be obvious);<br>reading them could help a reader understand the behavior of this<br>document as well.<br><br>&nbsp;  Sublayer Protocol (6P) [<a href="/doc/rfc8480/">RFC8480</a>], and the Minimal Security Framework<br>&nbsp;  for 6TiSCH [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6tisch-minimal-security/">I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security</a>].&nbsp; In particular, MSF<br><br>[CoJP again]<br><br>&nbsp;  prevent it from receiving the join response.&nbsp; This situation should<br>&nbsp;  be detected through the absence of a particular node from the network<br>&nbsp;  and handled by the network administrator through out-of-band means,<br>&nbsp;  e.g. by moving the node outside the radio range of the attacker.<br><br>"the radio range of the attacker" is not exactly a fixed constant ...<br>attackers are not in general bound by legal limits and can increase Tx<br>power subject only to their equipment and budget.<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF adapts to traffics containing packets from IP layer.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  possible that the IP packet has a non-zero DSCP (Diffserv Code Point<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2597/">RFC2597</a>]) value in its IPv6 header.&nbsp;

How significant<br>a disruption would be incurred if a device periodically changes its<br>presented EUI64 for anonymization purposes?<br><br>There seems to be a general pattern of "if you don't have a<br>6P-negotiated Tx cell, install and AutoTxCell to send your one message<br>and then remove it after sending"; I wonder if it would be easier on the<br>reader to consolidate this as a general principle and not repeat the<br>details every time it occurs.<br><br>Requirements Language<br><br>"NOT RECOMMENDED" is not in the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> boilerplate (but is a <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> keyword).<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  the 6 steps described in Section 4.&nbsp; The end state of the join<br>&nbsp;  process is that the node is synchronized to the network, has mutually<br>&nbsp;  authenticated to the network, has identified a routing parent, and<br><br>nit(?): I guess maybe "mutually authenticated with" is more correct for<br>the bidirectional operation.<br><br>&nbsp;  It does so for 3 reasons: to match the link-layer resources to the<br>&nbsp;  traffic, to handle changing parent, to handle a schedule collision.<br><br>nit: end the list with "or" (or "and"?).<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF works closely with RPL, specifically the routing parent defined<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; This specification only describes how MSF works with<br>&nbsp;  one routing parent, which is phrased as "selected parent".&nbsp; The<br><br>nit: I suggest '''one routing parent; this parent is referred to as the<br>"selected parent"'''.<br><br>&nbsp;  activity of MSF towards to single routing parent is called as a "MSF<br><br>nit: "towards the"<br><br>&nbsp;

 MSF uses the minimal cell for broadcast frames such as Enhanced<br>&nbsp;  Beacons (EBs) [IEEE802154] and broadcast DODAG Information Objects<br>&nbsp;  (DIOs) [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; Cells scheduled by MSF are meant to be used only<br>&nbsp;  for unicast frames.<br><br>If this paragraph was moved before the previous paragraph, then EB and<br>DIO would be defined before their first usage.<br><br>&nbsp;  bandwidth of minimal cell.&nbsp; One of the algorithm met the rule is the<br>&nbsp;  Trickle timer defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC6206</a>] which is applied on DIO messages<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6550/">RFC6550</a>].&nbsp; However, any such algorithm of limiting the broadcast<br><br>nit(?): "One of the algorithms that fulfills this requirement"?<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF RECOMMENDS the use of 3 slotframes.&nbsp; MSF schedules autonomous<br>&nbsp;  cells at Slotframe 1 (Section 3) and 6P negotiated cells at Slotframe<br>&nbsp;  2 (Section 5) , while Slotframe 0 is used for the bootstrap traffic<br>&nbsp;  as defined in the Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED to<br>&nbsp;  use the same slotframe length for Slotframe 0, 1 and 2.&nbsp; Thus it is<br><br>Perhaps this is just a question of writing style, but if an<br>implementation is free to use an alternative SF or a variant of MSF,<br>could we not say that "MSF uses 3 slotframts", "MSF uses the same<br>slotframe length for", etc.?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Is there any risk of unwanted correlation between slot and channel<br>offsets when using the same hash function and input for both<br>calculations?<br><br>&nbsp;  hash function.&nbsp; Other optional parameters defined in SAX determine<br>&nbsp;  the performance of SAX hash function.&nbsp; Those parameters could be<br>&nbsp;  broadcasted in EB frame or pre-configured.&nbsp; For interoperability<br>&nbsp;  purposes, an example how the hash function is implemented is detailed<br>&nbsp;  in Appendix B.<br><br>Given the lack of usable reference for [SAX-DASFAA], I assume that the<br>content in Appendix B is going to be used as a specification, not just<br>an example.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The AutoRxCell MUST always remain scheduled after synchronized.<br><br>nit: s/synchronized/synchronization/<br><br>&nbsp;  AutoRxCell.&nbsp; In case of conflicting with a negotiated cell,<br>&nbsp;  autonomous cells take precedence over negotiated cell, which is<br>&nbsp;  stated in [IEEE802154].&nbsp; However, when the Slotframe 0, 1 and 2 use<br>&nbsp;  the same length value, it is possible for negotiated cell to avoid<br>&nbsp;  the collision with AutoRxCell.<br><br>Presumably this factors in to the recommendation to have the three<br>listed slotframes use the same length, but mentioning it explicitly<br>(whether here or where the recommendation is made) might be nice.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; Alternative behaviors may involved, for example, when<br>&nbsp;  alternative security solution is used for the network.&nbsp; Section 4.1<br><br>nit: singular/plural mismatch "behaviors"/"solution is used"<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  A node implementing MSF SHOULD implement the Minimal Security<br>&nbsp;  Framework for 6TiSCH [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6tisch-minimal-security/">I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security</a>].&nbsp; As a<br><br>Didn't this get renamed to CoJP?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>I a little bit wonder if there is a better description than "available<br>frequencies" but don't have one to offer.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  While the exact behavior is implementation-specific, it is<br>&nbsp;  RECOMMENDED that after having received the first EB, a node keeps<br>&nbsp;  listen for at most MAX_EB_DELAY seconds until it has received EBs<br>&nbsp;  from NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT distinct neighbors, which is defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>].<br><br>nit(?): this phrasing implies that only NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT is<br>defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC 8180</a>, but MAX_EB_DELAY is also defined there.<br><br>not-nit: this phrasing is ambiguous as to whether one of MAX_EB_DELAY<br>and NUM_NEIGHBOURS_TO_WAIT is sufficient to move to the next step or<br>whether both are required.<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  After selected a JP, a node generates a Join Request and installs an<br>&nbsp;  AutoTxCell to the JP.&nbsp; The Join Request is then sent by the pledge to<br>&nbsp;  its JP over the AutoTxCell.&nbsp; The AutoTxCell is removed by the pledge<br><br>editorial: I'd suggest s/its JP/its selected JP/<br><br>&nbsp;  Response is sent out.&nbsp; The pledge receives the Join Response from its<br>&nbsp;  AutoRxCell, thereby learns the keying material used in the network,<br>&nbsp;  as well as other configurations, and becomes a "joined node".<br><br>nit: maybe "other configuration values" or "other configuration<br>settings"?<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Once it has selected a routing parent, the joined node MUST generate<br>&nbsp;  a 6P ADD Request and install an AutoTxCell to that parent.&nbsp; The 6P<br>&nbsp;  ADD Request is sent out through the AutoTxCell with the following<br>&nbsp;  fields:<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CellOptions: set to TX=1,RX=0,SHARED=0<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; NumCells: set to 1<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CellList: at least 5 cells, chosen according to Section 8<br><br>Is this listing describing the contents of the ADD request or the<br>AuthTxCell used to send it?&nbsp; (I presume the former, in which case I<br>suggest to use "containing" or similar in preference to "with".)<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The goal of MSF is to manage the communication schedule in the 6TiSCH<br>&nbsp;  schedule in a distributed manner.&nbsp; For a node, this translates into<br>&nbsp;  monitoring the current usage of the cells it has to the selected<br>&nbsp;  parent:<br><br>Is this goal strictly limited to traffic "to the selected parent" vs.<br>all traffic?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; If the node determines that the number of link-layer frames it is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attempting to exchange with the selected parent per unit of time<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is larger than the capacity offered by the TSCH negotiated cells<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it has scheduled with it, the node issues a 6P ADD command to that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parent to add cells to the TSCH schedule.<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; If the traffic is lower than the capacity, the node issues a 6P<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DELETE command to that parent to delete cells from the TSCH<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; schedule.<br><br>As written, this would potentially lead to oscillation when demand is<br>basically at capacity, due to the quantization of capacity.&nbsp; Perhaps<br>some provisioning for hysteresis is appropriate?<br><br>&nbsp;  The cell option of cells listed in CellList in 6P Request frame<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD be either Tx=1 only or Rx=1 only.&nbsp; Both NumCellsElapsed and<br>&nbsp;  NumCellsUsed counters can be used to both type of negotiated cells.<br><br>Would this be more clear as "(Tx=1,Rx=0) or (Tx=0,Rx=1)"?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; NumCellsElapsed is incremented by exactly 1 when the current cell<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is AutoRxCell.<br><br>This holds for all peers/parents we're keeping counters for, so the<br>AutoRxCell can get "double counted"?<br><br>&nbsp;  In case that a node booted or disappeared from the network, the cell<br>&nbsp;  reserved at the selected parent may be kept in the schedule forever.<br>&nbsp;  A clean-up mechanism MUST be provided to resolve this issue.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  clean-up mechanism is implementation-specific.&nbsp; It could either be a<br>&nbsp;  periodic polling to the neighbors the nodes have negotiated cells<br>&nbsp;  with, or monitoring the activities on those cells.&nbsp; The goal is to<br>&nbsp;  confirm those negotiated cells are not used anymore by the associated<br>&nbsp;  neighbors and remove them from the schedule.<br><br>I'm not sure that "monitoring the activities on those cells" is safe<br>with the current level of specification; if a node negotiates a 6P<br>transmit cell to a parent and uses it only sparingly, with the parent<br>eventually reclaiming it due to inactivity, I don't see a mechanism by<br>which the node will reliably discover the negotiated cell to be<br>nonfunctional and fall back to (e.g.) the corresponding AutoTxCell.&nbsp; It<br>may be most prudent to just not mention that as an example (a "periodic<br>polling" procedure does not seem to have the same potential for<br>information skew)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  schedule is executed and the node sends frames to that parent.&nbsp; When<br>&nbsp;  NumTx reaches MAX_NUMTX, both NumTx and NumTxAck MUST be divided by<br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; For example, when MAX_NUMTX is set to 256, from NumTx=255 and<br>&nbsp;  NumTxAck=127, the counters become NumTx=128 and NumTxAck=64 if one<br>&nbsp;  frame is sent to the parent with an Acknowledgment received.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  operation does not change the value of the PDR, but allows the<br>&nbsp;  counters to keep incrementing.&nbsp; The value of MAX_NUMTX is<br>&nbsp;  implementation-specific.<br><br>Does MAX_NUMTX need to be a power of two (to avoid errors when the<br>division occurs)?<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; For any other cell, it compares its PDR against that of the cell<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  with the highest PDR.&nbsp; If the difference is larger than<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RELOCATE_PDRTHRES, it triggers the relocation of that cell using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a 6P RELOCATE command.<br><br>The recommended RELOCATE_PDRTHRES is given as "50 %".&nbsp; Is this<br>"difference" performed as a subtraction (so that if the highest PDR is<br>less than 50%, no cells can ever be relocated) or a ratio (a PDR that's<br>half than the maximum PDR or smaller will trigger relocation)?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Maybe reference Section 17.1 where the allocation will occur?<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The slotOffset of a cell in the CellList SHOULD be randomly and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uniformly chosen among all the slotOffset values that satisfy the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; restrictions above.<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The channelOffset of a cell in the CellList SHOULD be randomly and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uniformly chosen in [0..numFrequencies], where numFrequencies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; represents the number of frequencies a node can communicate on.<br><br>Do these random selections need to be independent from each other?&nbsp; (I<br>note that the selection for the autonomous cells are not.)<br><br>Section 9<br><br>Is there a reference for these three parameters (MAXBE, MAXRETRIES,<br>SLOTFRAME_LENGTH)?&nbsp; SLOTFRAME_LENGTH seems new in this document and is<br>listed in the table in Section 14, but the other two are not listed<br>there.<br><br>Section 14<br><br>Why is MAX_NUMTX not listed in the table?<br><br>Can we really give a recommended NUM_CH_OFFSET value, since this is in<br>effect dependent on the number of channels available?<br><br>KA_PERIOD is defined but not used elsewhere in the document.<br><br>What are the considerations in using a power of 10 vs. a power of 2 as<br>MAX_NUM_CELLS?<br><br>Section 16<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF defines a series of "rules" for the node to follow.&nbsp; It triggers<br>&nbsp;  several actions, that are carried out by the protocols defined in the<br>&nbsp;  following specifications: the Minimal IPv6 over the TSCH Mode of IEEE<br>&nbsp;  802.15.4e (6TiSCH) Configuration [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>], the 6TiSCH Operation<br><br>I'd suggest a brief note that the security considerations of those<br>protocols continue to apply (even though it ought to be obvious);<br>reading them could help a reader understand the behavior of this<br>document as well.<br><br>&nbsp;

In particular, MSF<br><br>[CoJP again]<br><br>&nbsp;  prevent it from receiving the join response.&nbsp; This situation should<br>&nbsp;  be detected through the absence of a particular node from the network<br>&nbsp;  and handled by the network administrator through out-of-band means,<br>&nbsp;  e.g. by moving the node outside the radio range of the attacker.<br><br>"the radio range of the attacker" is not exactly a fixed constant ...<br>attackers are not in general bound by legal limits and can increase Tx<br>power subject only to their equipment and budget.<br><br>&nbsp;  MSF adapts to traffics containing packets from IP layer.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  possible that the IP packet has a non-zero DSCP (Diffserv Code Point<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2597/">RFC2597</a>]) value in its IPv6 header.&nbsp;

What can be changes in the "example" algorithm and what not?<br><br>Two small technical points:<br>2) Sec 9; mostly double-checking as you probably know better than me:<br>"6P timeout value is calculated as ((2^MAXBE)-1)*MAXRETRIES*SLOTFRAME_LENGTH"<br>Often you calculate such a value and then multiply by 2 (or something) to be on the safe side, as there could be e.g. processing delays in the receiving node. I assume the assumption here is that you always need to get the response in the same/after one slot (?). If that is true, I guess the calculation is fine. But wanted to check that there cannot be any additional unknown delays here.<br><br>Further, these values come a bit out of nothing. Where are&nbsp; MAXBE and MAXRETRIES defined? And if you have an exponential backoff that will stop retrying after MAXRETRIES why do you need also a timeout in addition to that?<br><br>2) Sec 16:<br>"&nbsp;  MSF adapts to traffics containing packets from IP layer.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  possible that the IP packet has a non-zero DSCP (Diffserv Code Point<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2597/">RFC2597</a>]) value in its IPv6 header.&nbsp; The decision whether to hand<br>&nbsp;  over that packet to MAC layer to transmit or to drop that packet<br>&nbsp;  belongs to the upper layer and is out of scope of MSF.&nbsp; As long as<br>&nbsp;  the decision is made to hand over to MAC layer to transmit, MSF will<br>&nbsp;  take that packet into account when adapting to traffic."<br>Why should a packet be dropped based on it DSCP...? Maybe be a bit more neutral here like:<br>"&nbsp;  MSF adapts to traffics containing packets from IP layer.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  possible that the IP packet has a non-zero DSCP (Diffserv Code Point<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2597/">RFC2597</a>]) value in its IPv6 header.&nbsp; The decision how to handle<br>&nbsp;  belongs to the upper layer and is out of scope of MSF. As long as<br>&nbsp;  a decision is made to hand over to MAC layer to transmit, MSF will<br>&nbsp;  take that packet into account when adapting to traffic."<br><br>Some small editorial nits/comments:<br>1) Sec 1: <br>- Maybe expand RPL on first occurrence.<br>- s/is called as a "MSF session"/is called a "MSF session"/<br><br>2) Sec 2<br>- s/one of more slotframes/one or more slotframes/<br><br>3) Sec 4.4<br>- Please expand JRC on first occurrence. Maybe add a glossary at the beginning?<br><br>4) Sec 5.1.<br>"&nbsp;  A node implementing MSF MUST implement the behavior described in this<br>&nbsp;  section."<br>Not sure if that sentence brings any additional value because that's what specs are for. But I guess it also doesn't hurt.<br>And respectively I find the statement in 5.3 rather confusing<br>"&nbsp;  A node implementing MSF SHOULD implement the behavior described in<br>&nbsp;  this section.&nbsp; The "MUST" statements in this section hence only apply<br>&nbsp;  if the node implements schedule collision handling."<br>I'm not fully sure what this even means now. Can you explain? Can you maybe rather provide some text to explain when it could/MAY be appropriate to not implement it?<br><br>5) Sec 16:<br>"The implementation at IPv6 layer<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD ensure that this join traffic is rate-limited before it is<br>&nbsp;  passed to 6top sublayer where MSF can observe it. "<br>Maybe be less indirect here:<br>"The implementation at IPv6 layer<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD rate-limited join traffic before it is<br>&nbsp;  passed to 6top sublayer where MSF can observe it."<br><br>Also this wording is a bit unclear:<br>" How this rate limit is set is out of scope of MSF."<br>Maybe<br>" How this rate limit is implemented is out of scope of MSF.<br><br>6) "Appendix A.&nbsp; Contributors" -&gt; Usually Contributors is an own section in the body of the document and not part of the appendix but I'm sure the RFC editor will advise you correctly.</div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This specification defines the 6TiSCH Minimal Scheduling Function<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (MSF).&nbsp; This Scheduling Function describes both the behavior of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  node when joining the network, and how the communication schedule is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  managed in a distributed fashion.&nbsp; MSF builds upon the 6TiSCH<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Operation Sublayer Protocol (6P) and the Minimal Security Framework<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  for 6TiSCH. Other SFs may be defined in the future.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The group work on Scheduling Functions (SF) for a long time, with work such as SF0 and ASF. The best ideas were merged in this simplified version. The methid was implemented and implementation feedback helped refining the details of it.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is at least one implementation by INRIA (Tengfei Chang).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tengfei reported on experimentations at IETF 106.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There's also an implementation in te Kon Tiki simulator.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yasuyuki Tanaka performed extensive reviews as part of his work on the simulator.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Shepherd: Pascal Thubert<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The shepherd performed an in depth review in parallel with an additional one by Yasuyuki Tanaka. The security section was enhanced, and the fact that all parents are managed individually was clarified. V-09 is the main outcome, with additions in v-10.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No concern. The document appears ready.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; All the authors responded that there's no IPR, but one. Still chasing him. I do not expect there's IPR though, since the author was working with <a href="http://ri.se">ri.se</a> at the time.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a disclosure by Cisco (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3253/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3253/</a>) that was discussed in the thread "IPR Disclosure Cisco's Statement about IPR related to <a href="/doc/draft-chang-6tisch-msf/">draft-chang-6tisch-msf</a>". There was no opposition. Note that Cisco has IPR on key elements of 6TiSCH so this does not change the situation in any remarkable way.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The core of the 6TiSCH participants reviewed and supported the document.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing apart downrefs discussed below<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such need<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing disquieting, on the contrary publication will help move cluster 130 on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/cluster_info.php?cid=C310">https://www.rfc-editor.org/cluster_info.php?cid=C310</a>)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This draft is actually already expected in C130 for a X-ref with the 6TiSCH Architecture.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; One reference, ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon is passed WGLC.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; They other references are already queued at RFC editor in MISSREF for this and other drafts.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The NITs tool found one DOWNREF to be sorted out with A-D.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the 6TiSCH architecture that was downgraded to INFO from an initial STD target.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Interestingly <a href="/doc/rfc7554/">RFC 7554</a> is also a DOWNREF, not caught by the tool. I asked the authors to move to informational references since it does not appear to be used normatively.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IANA section checked, the proposed addition in an existing subregistry is correctly documented and matches the registration procedure.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No added (sub) registry<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such thing</div></td>
