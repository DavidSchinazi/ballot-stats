I don't think this WG has actually fulfilled its charter with regard to this document set. The WG was supposed to produce a "JSON syntax that can be used by applications to describe secure data objects". I don't believe it did that. Instead, it produced a compact serialization for a particular purpose and then backed into a JSON syntax. The compact serialization drove the effort and produced IMO a substandard JSON serialization. I don't believe that (reliable) interoperable implementations of the JSON serialization will be possible using this document set. However, there is at least rough consensus that these documents are usable as-is, and I don't think there's anything to be gained by holding them up any further.<br><br>I hope the WG will adopt some of the remaining comments, but my intention is not to discuss this any further. If you wish to address any of the comments and need clarification, I'm glad to help with that.<br><br>------<br><br>3.1/4.1/5.1/6.1: The implementation requirements do not belong in this document. They should be removed.<br><br>3.2ff: None of these algorithm requirements (using MUSTs) really belong in this document.

Saying US-ASCII here would solve the problem, so unless you think you're going to have the MötleyCrüe algorithm, perhaps we can avoid any concerns for this case. (My concern is that you can have "interesting" UTF-8 strings with ZERO-WIDTH JOINERs and other nonsense that you probably don't mean to address.<br><br>4.8:<br><br>&nbsp;  The PBES2 password input is an<br>&nbsp;  octet sequence; if the password to be used is represented as a text<br>&nbsp;  string rather than an octet sequence, the UTF-8 encoding of the text<br>&nbsp;  string MUST be used as the octet sequence.<br><br>This one worries me a lot. It's one thing to say that the password is an octet sequence and the application above is responsible for collecting it from the user and passing it in the correct form. But to say down here in the guts that it MUST be UTF-8 brings up all sorts of ugly questions regarding normalization. I don't think you want to touch this with a 10-foot-pole. I certainly thing you want to stay away from that MUST.<br><br>4.8.1.1: Same as 4.6.2.</div></td>

We understand that anyone requesting registration from IANA should be directed to the mailing list, and that a designated expert will contact us upon approval of any request.<br><br>First, in a location to be determined, IANA will create a new registry called the JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registry.&nbsp;

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary: <br><br>This document, the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification, registers <br>cryptographic algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web <br>Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK) <br>specifications.&nbsp; It establishes several IANA registries for these identifiers. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document has clear working group consensus for publication, and has <br>been reviewed by several WG participants since its initial adoption as a <br>working group item. The question of what cryptographic algorithms should be <br>included was somewhat difficult as it is for any process trying to determine <br>which algorithms should be included. The considerations included what is <br>implemented, available, broadly used, and adequate from a security <br>perspective. The issue of algorithms that are potentially less desirable but <br>more broadly implemented was considered. <br> <br>Document Quality:<br> <br>This document has been reviewed and revised many times. There are multiple <br>implementations of this document. Some of these are listed at: <br><a href="https://openid.net/developers/libraries/">https://openid.net/developers/libraries/</a> (see the JWT/JWS/JWE/JWK/JWA <br>Implementations section). There were no specific external expert reviews <br>conducted; however, the WGLC notification was sent to the W3C WebCrypto <br>working group. <br> <br>Personnel: <br><br>Karen O'Donoghue is acting as the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; Kathleen Moriarty is <br>the Responsible Area Director. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd.

If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>This document doesnÕt require any special reviews beyond those planned <br>during the IESG review process. As a security specification, additional security <br>reviews during this process are expected. <br> <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has <br>with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should <br>be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain <br>parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In <br>any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still <br>wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br> <br>The Document Shepherd is comfortable with this document as a stable set of <br>algorithms and the definition of registries for the addition of further <br>algorithms. There has also been some coordination with the W3C WebCrypto <br>working group regarding the definition and use of these registries.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>(JWA) This document, the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification, registers cryptographic algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK) specifications.&nbsp; It defines several IANA registries for these identifiers. <br><br>(JWE) This document, JSON Web Encryption (JWE), represents encrypted content using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures. <br><br>(JWK) This document, JSON Web Key (JWK), is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key.&nbsp; This specification also defines a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) JSON data structure for representing a set of JWKs. <br><br>(JWS) This document, JSON Web Signature (JWS), represents content secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) based data structures.&nbsp; <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document has clear working group consensus for publication, and has been reviewed by several WG participants since its initial adoption as a working group item.<br><br>(JWA) The question of what cryptographic algorithms should be included was somewhat difficult as it is for any process trying to determine which algorithms should be included. The considerations included what is implemented, available, broadly used, and adequate from a security perspective. The issue of algorithms that are potentially less desirable but more broadly implemented was considered. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple implementations of all four documents. There were no specific external expert reviews conducted. The WGLC notification was sent to the W3C WebCrypto working group. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Karen O'Donoghue is acting as the Document Shepard.&nbsp; Kathleen Morirty&nbsp; is the Responsible Area Director<br><br>(3) The document shepherd has followed the working group process and reviewed the final documents and feels these documents are ready for IESG review. Further discussion and changes may result from IESG and IETF review, but the documents as they stand are ready for publication. <br><br>(4) The document shepherd does not have any concerns about the reviews that were performed. <br><br>(5) JSON-Web-Signture and JSON-Web-Key register new Media Types.&nbsp; A request for review has been sent to the media type review mailing list.<br><br>(6) The Document Shepherd is comfortable with these documents as a stable set of specifications that have been implemented and adopted in some communities (most especially OpenID). There has also been some attempt to coordinate with the W3C WebCrypto working group. The documents are not perfect, but they do represent the consensus of the working group. There is a minority contingent of recognized experts that believe there are a number of issues in the documents. However, these specifications have been widely implemented and deployed in the OpenID community.<br><br>(7) All authors have confirmed that they have dealt with all appropriate IPR disclosures.<br><br>(8) Certicom Corporation has filed an IPR discloser on <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms/">draft-ietf-jose-json-web-algorithms</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature/">draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature</a> dealing with elliptical curve technologies.&nbsp; These patents are the normal IPR disclosure from Certicom and received only a brief discussion. The group was notified of an additional possible patent from IBM, but no discloser was ever filed and no discussion was ever held on the patent. (The patent appears to be a mechanical transformation of XML digital signatures and mapping it onto JSON.)<br><br>(9) The majority of the documents represent a solid WG consensus, however there are some issues for which consensus was reached more by fatigue, with strong proponents on both sides of the issues.<br><br>(10) There have been no threats of anyone appealing the documents.<br><br>(11) The following nit errors were identified.
