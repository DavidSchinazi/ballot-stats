(I'd be happy<br>to learn that this is well-covered elsewhere in the document set; I just haven't<br>run into it yet.)<br><br>In a similar vein, do we want to have any treatment of avoiding infinite loops<br>(e.g., when a 'configure' or 'advertisement' is rejected in expectation of modification<br>but the sending implementation continues to generate an identical message)?<br><br>It is not clear to me that any change to the document text is needed in either case,<br>but I don't know to what extent the topics have already been discussed.<br><br>COMMENT<br><br>I also have some substantial comments that do not rise to Discuss-level.<br><br>How do I know which endpoint is the channel initiator and which is the<br>channel receiver?<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-clue-signaling/">draft-ietf-clue-signaling</a> suggests that the DTLS client is the channel<br>initiator, but even that is not explicit about it -- the protocol could be<br>considered under-specified if there is insufficient clarity.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>The MCU definition doesn't actually expand the acronym, which seems a<br>little reader-unfriendly.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>There are perhaps more XML extension points in here than is reasonable for<br>some of these elements (e.g., ).<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the responseCode is between 200 and 299<br>&nbsp;  inclusive, the response MUST also include ,<br>&nbsp;  ,&nbsp; and&nbsp; elements;<br><br>Maybe re-mention that MP and MC are booleans here.<br><br>&nbsp;  Finally, the commonly supported extensions are copied in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; field.<br><br>Does this need to say that only extensions that are applicable to the<br>negotiated protocol version are included?&nbsp; (Also, how does one handle an<br>extension that exists for multiple major versions -- are there two<br> elments for it in the&nbsp; message?)<br><br>&nbsp;  Upon reception of the 'optionsResponse' the version to be used is the<br>&nbsp;  one provided in the&nbsp; tag of the message.&nbsp; The following CLUE<br>&nbsp;  messages MUST use such a version number in the "v" attribute.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  allowed extensions in the CLUE dialogue are those indicated in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the 'optionsResponse' message.<br><br>Couldn't this restriction on the "v" value apply even to the<br>'optionsResponse' message?<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The 'advertisement' message is used by the MP to advertise the<br>&nbsp;  available media captures and related information to the MC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'd consider avoiding the definite article "the" to refer to MP/MC roles,<br>since in many caess there will be 2+ of each, and we don't want to confuse<br>the reader into thinking that there is an MP/CR equivalence or something<br>like that.&nbsp; So, perhaps "each MP" and "the corresponding MC".<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As it can be seen from the message schema<br>&nbsp;  provided in the following excerpt (Figure 6), the 'ack' contains a<br>&nbsp;  response code and a reason string for describing the processing<br>&nbsp;  result of the 'advertisement'.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>[the reason string is part of the base clueResponseType]<br>The text quoted here could be read as implying that the reason string is<br>required in the 'ack' message, a stronger requirement than of the base<br>clueResponseType where it has minOccurs=0.&nbsp; Some greater clarity in the<br>text here is probably called for, especially since when the 'ack' is<br>piggybacked on a 'configure' message, there is no provision for a reason<br>string at all. <br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The&nbsp; element MUST NOT be present if an<br>&nbsp;  'ack' message has been already sent back to the MP.<br><br>I think you need to clarify that this is scoped to the current<br>advSequenceNr.<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It contains (Figure 8) a<br>&nbsp;  response code with a reason string indicating either the success or <br>&nbsp;  the failure (along with failure details) of a 'configure' request<br>&nbsp;  processing.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>[Same comment about reason string as for 'ack']<br><br>Section 5.7<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Such new response codes MUST NOT overwrite the ones here defined and<br>&nbsp;  they MUST respect the semantics of the first code digit.<br><br>nit: is this "overwrite" or "override"?<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  This document does not define response codes starting with "1", and<br>&nbsp;  such response codes are not allowed to appear in major version 1 of<br>&nbsp;  the CLUE protocol.&nbsp; The range from 100 to 199 inclusive is reserved<br>&nbsp;  for future major versions of the protocol to define response codes<br>&nbsp;  for delayed or incomplete operations if necessary.&nbsp; Response codes<br>&nbsp;  starting with "5" through "9" are reserved for future major versions<br>&nbsp;  of the protocol to define new classes of response, and are not <br>&nbsp;  allowed in major version 1 of the CLUE protocol.&nbsp; Response codes <br>&nbsp;  starting with "0" are not allowed.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This text seems to also preclude extensions to major version '1' from<br>defining 1xx or [5-9]xx reason codes; is that the intent?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  When the CLUE data channel set up starts ("start channel"), the CP<br>&nbsp;  moves from the IDLE state to the CHANNEL SETUP state.<br><br>nit: only one of "sets up" and "starts" is needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  When in the ACTIVE state, the CP starts the envisioned sub-state<br>&nbsp;  machines (i.e., the MP state machine and the MC state machine)<br>&nbsp;  according to the roles it plays in the telepresence sessions.&nbsp; Such<br>&nbsp;  roles have been previously declared in the 'options' and<br>&nbsp;  'optionsResponse' messages involved in the initiation phase (see<br>&nbsp;  OPTIONS sections Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 for the details).&nbsp; [...]<br>&nbsp;  <br>My reading of the initiation phase is that each CP sends only a boolean<br>indication of whether it supports the MP/MC roles, and so each party has to<br>determine on its own whether it will act as a MP and/or MC; is that<br>correct?&nbsp; If so, do we need to say anything about how the boolean matrix<br>translates to activating the respective sub-state machines?<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'configure+ack' messages referring to out-of-<br>&nbsp;  date (i.e., having a sequence number equal to or less than the<br>&nbsp;  highest seen so far) advertisements MUST be ignored, i.e., they do<br>&nbsp;  not trigger any state transition.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is this really less than or equal or just less than?&nbsp; Also, is "seen" the<br>right verb, since IIUC these are sequence numbers that the MP has<br>*generated* in its advertisements?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other<br>&nbsp;  words, in this example, the MP MUST use version 1.4 and downgrade to<br>&nbsp;  the lower version.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: does the phrase "and downgrade to the lower version" add any value<br>here?&nbsp; The word "downgrade" can have negative connotations in some other<br>contexts, so if it's not adding value I'd suggest avoiding it.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  As reported in Figure 13, the values of the fields of the <br>&nbsp;  element (either new information or new messages) take the following<br>&nbsp;  values:<br>[...]<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; the major standard version of the protocol that the extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; refers to.<br><br>The XSL includes a full version (including minor), even though the<br>semantics basically only use the major version.&nbsp; That said, why is the<br>'version' element minOccurs="0" -- what are the semantics when it is<br>absent?<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The CLUE data model document ([<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-clue-data-model-schema/">I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema</a>])<br>&nbsp;  envisions the possibility of adding this kind of "extra" information<br>&nbsp;  in the description of a video capture by keeping the compatibility<br>&nbsp;  with the CLUE data model schema.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: I don't think this is grammatical; maybe just "keeping compatibility".<br><br>Section 10<br><br>This claims to be a "call flow" example, but the described flows only<br>contain a single unidirectional media flow, which is not really consistent<br>with the normal usage of the word "call".&nbsp; Buried in the body text there is<br>a disclaimer:<br>&nbsp;  [...]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the sake of simplicity, the following<br>&nbsp;  call flow focuses only on the dialogue between MP CP1 and MC CP2.<br>I would suggest making the presence of this simplification much clearer<br>from the start, perhaps "CLUE protocol messages exchanged in the following<br>call flow are detailed; only one direction of media is shown for<br>simplicity, as the other direction is precisely symmetric".<br><br>&nbsp;  CP2 acknowledges the second 'advertisement' message with an 'ack'<br>&nbsp;  message (Section 10.7).<br><br>&nbsp;  In a second moment, CP2 changes the requested media streams from CP1<br>&nbsp;  by sending to CP1 a 'configure' message replacing the previously<br>&nbsp;  selected video streams with the new composed media streams advertised<br>&nbsp;  by CP1 (Section 10.8).<br><br>This might be an appropriate place to indicate that media from the previous<br>configuration continue to flow during the reconfiguration process.<br><br>It might also be worth noting again somewhere in here (or a subsection)<br>that there are three (well, two, since we only show one direction of media)<br>distinct sequence number spaces per sender, and that the discontinuity<br>between Section 10.2 and 10.3's numbers is correct.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>Thanks for the well-thought-through security considerations; in combination<br>with the linked documents (particularly the framework), they cover all the<br>considerations (especially privacy considerations) that I had in mind.<br><br>Section 14.2<br><br>We appear to be citing both 5117 and 7667, whereas the latter obsoletes the<br>former.</div></td>

If so, are there internationalization issues to consider?<br><br>§6.2, 5th paragraph: This says that if you get an error back for a configure message, you send a new configure message.

This section requires an endpoint to ignore unknown elements, but it also requires the peer to downgrade to the highest shared version. These requirements seem to be at cross purposes. If the peer downgrades, one should only see unknown elements in the case of implementation errors. The requirement to ignore unknown elements does not come for free; nor does the requirement to downgrade.<br><br>§5.1 and §8: The use of the options message to negotiate extensions seems underspecified.

When an endpoint sends a message and is waiting for a response, shouldn't there be a separate waiting state (for example, when waiting for optionsResponse)?

For example if this depends on the security properties of datachannels (over SCTP and DTLS), then it's worth some language to the effect that it MUST not be used on other transports, or that if it is used on other transports they must have similar security properties.<br><br>§2, definition of endpoint: Please cite <a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC3261</a> for SIP. (I have mixed feelings whether this needs to be normative or informational.)<br><br>§4:<br>- "a lack of interoperability between the<br>protocol implementations. In order to correctly establish a CLUE<br>dialogue, the involved CPs MUST have in common a major version number"<br><br>That seems like a statement of fact. I suggest reserving the normative keywords for the actual procedures that require this.<br><br>§5:<br>- ClueID: Is this truly optional in the sence of never required under any circumstances?<br>- sequenceNr: Is the language about incrementing intended to use normative keywords? (e.g MUST)?<br>Why do implementations need to send errors for unexpected sequence numbers when using a reliable protocol? That would only happen in the case of implementation errors, right?<br>Why is it optional to start with a random sequence number? Is there a concern about fingerprinting if people choose otherwise? (I guess as the security considerations mention, there's a lot of other things to fingerprint.)<br><br>- Protocol field: Do you envision non-CLUE messages will ever occur on the same SCTP association? if not, then why require this? If so, then what should an endpoint do if it gets a message with something other than "clue" here?<br><br>§5.1: "since minor versions are<br>defined to be both backwards and forwards compatible,"<br>Please see related DISCUSS comment.<br><br>§5.7: <br><br>- What is the reason for defining meaning the "100" response code range if no codes in that range are defined? Why is this different from the 500-900 ranges that are merely reserved for future use? (I gather there was an intent to be consistent with SIP error codes, but why not leave that to the first spec that defines a 1XX code, assuming that ever happens?<br><br>- "message. Implementations can (and are encouraged to)<br>include more specific descriptions of the error condition, if<br>possible."<br><br>Am I correct to assume that implementations should not expect any particular description text for a given error code? (That used to be a common interop problem for SIP.)<br><br>§6:<br>- "When the CLUE data channel set up starts ("start channel"), the CP<br>moves from the IDLE state to the CHANNEL SETUP state."<br><br>What does "set up starts" mean? Is this trigged by SDP signaling? SCTP connection? Is it different for the SCTP client and server? (I suspect the data-channel draft answers this, but it should at least be cited here.)<br><br>§6.1:<br>- "Finally, if there are changes<br>in the MP’s telepresence settings ("changed telepresence settings"),<br>the MP switches to the ADV state."<br>If I understand correctly, the MC can send new configure messages at any time. What happens if one arrives in the ADV state but before sending the advertise?<br><br>6.2, 2nd paragraph: <br>-&nbsp; Is the MC forbidden from sending a configure without the ack field set prior to sending an ack?<br>- Is the response code limited to 200, are or other 2XX codes allowed if defined?<br><br>§12.3: The mime type isn’t mentioned anywhere else in the doc? Why is it registered here? What is it used for?<br><br>§12.4.1: Why is it necessary to both register these directly in IANA and define them in a (presumably registered) schema? Am I correct to assume new message types must also be defined in a schema?<br><br>*** Editorial Comments ***<br><br>- General:<br>-- Please proofread for "which" vs "that" usage.<br>-- Please proofread for null words, especially "obviously" and similar terms, which some readers might read as condescending.<br><br>- Abstract: Is CLUE an acronym? If so, what is its expansion? (If the title is the expansion, it's very obscure.). If not, why all-caps?<br><br>§2: Please expand MCU on first mention.<br><br>§4:<br>- "The subset of the extensions<br>that are allowed within the CLUE session is also determined in the initiation phase, such subset being the one including only the extensions that are supported by both parties"<br>Convoluted sentence, can it be simplified?<br><br>- "Hence in a call between two<br>CPs, A and B, there would be two separate dialogs, as follows:"<br>Please define the meaning of "dialog" as used in this document. In particular, that it is not related to SIP's usage of the term.<br><br>§5:<br>"While the ’options’ and ’optionsResponse’ messages are exchanged in<br>the initiation phase between the CPs, the other messages are involved<br>in MP-MC dialogues."<br>This also needs a definition of "dialog" for the meaning to be clear.<br><br>§5.5: <br><br>- "The MC can send a<br>’configure’ after the reception of an ’advertisement’ or each time it<br>wants to request other captures that have been previously advertised<br>by the MP."<br>The use of "can" makes this seem optional. I gather from the state machine this is not the case.<br><br>- "It indicates that the ’configure’<br>message also acknowledges with success the referred advertisement<br>(’configure’ + ’ack’ message), by applying in that way a piggybacking<br>mechanism for simultaneously acknowledging and replying to the<br>’advertisement’ message."<br>Convoluted sentence.<br><br>5.7:<br>- "200, 300 and 400 codes are considered catch-alls."<br>Please elaborate on what "catch-all" means in context.<br><br>- "Further response codes can be either defined<br>in future versions of the protocol (by adding them to the related<br>IANA registry)..."<br>The parenthetical phrase is redundant to the next sentence.<br><br>§6: <br><br>- First Paragraph: The first and last sentences are redundant with earlier text in the draft. Should "MC process" and "MP process" be "MC role" and "MP role"?<br><br>§6.1, 3rd paragrap: The first sentence seems out of place, given that much of the previous paragraph was about what happens in the WAIT FOR CONF state.<br><br>- 5th paragraph: "If there are<br>changes in the MP’s telepresence settings ("changed telepresence<br>settings"), the MP moves back to the ADV state."<br>Redundant to previous paragraph.<br><br>§8.1, 2nd paragraph: The second sentence is redundant to similar text in §8.</div></td>

 such response codes are not allowed to appear in major version 1 of<br>&nbsp;  the CLUE protocol.&nbsp; The range from 100 to 199 inclusive is reserved<br>&nbsp;  for future major versions of the protocol to define response codes<br>&nbsp;  for delayed or incomplete operations if necessary.&nbsp; Response codes<br>&nbsp;  starting with "5" through "9" are reserved for future major versions<br>&nbsp;  of the protocol to define new classes of response, and are not <br>&nbsp;  allowed in major version 1 of the CLUE protocol.&nbsp; Response codes <br>&nbsp;  starting with "0" are not allowed.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This text seems to also preclude extensions to major version '1' from<br>defining 1xx or [5-9]xx reason codes; is that the intent?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  When the CLUE data channel set up starts ("start channel"), the CP<br>&nbsp;  moves from the IDLE state to the CHANNEL SETUP state.<br><br>nit: only one of "sets up" and "starts" is needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  When in the ACTIVE state, the CP starts the envisioned sub-state<br>&nbsp;  machines (i.e., the MP state machine and the MC state machine)<br>&nbsp;  according to the roles it plays in the telepresence sessions.&nbsp; Such<br>&nbsp;  roles have been previously declared in the 'options' and<br>&nbsp;  'optionsResponse' messages involved in the initiation phase (see<br>&nbsp;  OPTIONS sections Section 5.1 and Section 5.2 for the details).&nbsp; [...]<br>&nbsp;  <br>My reading of the initiation phase is that each CP sends only a boolean<br>indication of whether it supports the MP/MC roles, and so each party has to<br>determine on its own whether it will act as a MP and/or MC; is that<br>correct?&nbsp; If so, do we need to say anything about how the boolean matrix<br>translates to activating the respective sub-state machines?<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'configure+ack' messages referring to out-of-<br>&nbsp;  date (i.e., having a sequence number equal to or less than the<br>&nbsp;  highest seen so far) advertisements MUST be ignored, i.e., they do<br>&nbsp;  not trigger any state transition.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is this really less than or equal or just less than?&nbsp; Also, is "seen" the<br>right verb, since IIUC these are sequence numbers that the MP has<br>*generated* in its advertisements?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;

 words, in this example, the MP MUST use version 1.4 and downgrade to<br>&nbsp;  the lower version.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: does the phrase "and downgrade to the lower version" add any value<br>here?&nbsp; The word "downgrade" can have negative connotations in some other<br>contexts, so if it's not adding value I'd suggest avoiding it.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  As reported in Figure 13, the values of the fields of the <br>&nbsp;  element (either new information or new messages) take the following<br>&nbsp;  values:<br>[...]<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; the major standard version of the protocol that the extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; refers to.<br><br>The XSL includes a full version (including minor), even though the<br>semantics basically only use the major version.&nbsp; That said, why is the<br>'version' element minOccurs="0" -- what are the semantics when it is<br>absent?<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The CLUE data model document ([<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-clue-data-model-schema/">I-D.ietf-clue-data-model-schema</a>])<br>&nbsp;  envisions the possibility of adding this kind of "extra" information<br>&nbsp;  in the description of a video capture by keeping the compatibility<br>&nbsp;  with the CLUE data model schema.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: I don't think this is grammatical; maybe just "keeping compatibility".<br><br>Section 10<br><br>This claims to be a "call flow" example, but the described flows only<br>contain a single unidirectional media flow, which is not really consistent<br>with the normal usage of the word "call".&nbsp; Buried in the body text there is<br>a disclaimer:<br>&nbsp;  [...]&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the sake of simplicity, the following<br>&nbsp;  call flow focuses only on the dialogue between MP CP1 and MC CP2.<br>I would suggest making the presence of this simplification much clearer<br>from the start, perhaps "CLUE protocol messages exchanged in the following<br>call flow are detailed; only one direction of media is shown for<br>simplicity, as the other direction is precisely symmetric".<br><br>&nbsp;  CP2 acknowledges the second 'advertisement' message with an 'ack'<br>&nbsp;  message (Section 10.7).<br><br>&nbsp;  In a second moment, CP2 changes the requested media streams from CP1<br>&nbsp;  by sending to CP1 a 'configure' message replacing the previously<br>&nbsp;  selected video streams with the new composed media streams advertised<br>&nbsp;  by CP1 (Section 10.8).<br><br>This might be an appropriate place to indicate that media from the previous<br>configuration continue to flow during the reconfiguration process.<br><br>It might also be worth noting again somewhere in here (or a subsection)<br>that there are three (well, two, since we only show one direction of media)<br>distinct sequence number spaces per sender, and that the discontinuity<br>between Section 10.2 and 10.3's numbers is correct.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>Thanks for the well-thought-through security considerations; in combination<br>with the linked documents (particularly the framework), they cover all the<br>considerations (especially privacy considerations) that I had in mind.<br><br>Section 14.2<br><br>We appear to be citing both 5117 and 7667, whereas the latter obsoletes the<br>former.</div></td>

However, this is a complete guess, as the document does unfortunately not say nothing about the mapping of CLUE messages to SCTP sessions.

Based on my reading, I do not think it is yet ready for IETF last call.<br><br>Most of my comments below are feedback that the document authors should treat as normal last call comments. The feedback that I consider to block progressing the document, in my role as AD, is explicitly marked with the prefix "BLOCKER", and these will need to be resolved in a new version of the document before progressing it further. Note that it is entirely possible that something I have marked "BLOCKER" may stem from an error on my part; so recognize that these are not demands for change, as much as a need to have things either fixed in the document or explained to me.<br><br>Title: The rule of thumb is that all but a small handful of well-known acronyms need to be expanded in titles and abstracts. I recognize that "CLUE" is a bit tortured, as acronyms go, but the title of this document is, broadly speaking, opaque. Please change it to something meaningful, such as "Protocol for Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE)"<br><br>General: There are three instances of excessively long lines in the document.<br><br>General: Please number and caption the figures in this document. Also, please refer to the figure numbers when pointing to them (e.g., the first paragraph of section 6.1 should read something like: "As soon as the sub-state machine of the MP (Figure 1) is activated..."."<br><br>BLOCKER: General: There are several mentions of timeouts and retry thresholds in the text and its corresponding state machines; however, the document neither defines nor cites a document as defining what these timeout and retry values are. These need to be defined and described. If the timer and retry scheme allows the two ends of the connection to have different values for timeouts and number of retries, then there need to be additional error procedures that allow the MC and MP state machines to stay in sync (if the timer/retry values can be different, it's possible for one state machine to transition to "terminated," while the other is still active, and you need messaging to clean this up). The remainder of this comment is non-blocking: Related to this, the document frequently refers to retries as "expiring" (e.g., "retry expired" on the state diagrams). That doesn't really make sense unless "retry" is the name of a timer rather than a counter; I think you mean to say "exhausted" or something similar.<br><br>General: This document defines six message types, all of which have at least two names, many of which have more. It would be a lot easier to keep track of what is being described if these were kept consistent. I suggest choosing one term for each concept and sticking with it. In other words, please pick only one name from each of the following lines, and do not use any of the others:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; OPTIONS, options<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; OPTIONS RESPONSE, optionsResponse<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ADVERTISEMENT, ADV, advertisement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ADVERTISEMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, ADV ACK, ACK, NACK, ack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIGURE, CONF, CONF+ACK, configure<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; CONFIGURE RESPONSE, CONF RESPONSE, configureResponse<br><br>The terminology section appears to be in alphabetical order, except for "Capture Encoding" (which was presumably "Media Capture Encoding" in some earlier version). Please fix.<br><br>The definitions for "Endpoint", "MCU", and "Media Stream/Stream" vary from the definition given in draft-ietf-clue-framework. Is this intentional?<br><br>The first paragraph of section 4 mentions the framework and data model documents without citations. There should probably be citations to the corresponding documents.<br><br>Section 4 contains the following text:<br><br>&nbsp;  The CLUE protocol represents the mechanism<br>&nbsp;  for the exchange of CLUE information between CLUE Participants<br><br>This is sufficiently circular as to be basically meaningless. Suggest: "...for the exchange of telepresence information between..."<br><br>Section 5: The versioning scheme in here is rather perplexing. Is there some technical reason the protocol restricts major version numbers to a single digit and minor versions to a single digit? Strongly suggest that this should be expanded to allow multiple digits for both the major and minor versions.<br><br>Section 5: It should be made clear that the XML Schema excerpts in section 5 are non-normative. In particular, I recommend adding the following text to the end of the first paragraph of section 5: "This section includes non-normative excerpts of the schema to aid in describing it."<br><br>Section 5: If the single-digit version numbers are maintained (and, again, I strongly recommend against this), the definition of versionType appears to be wrong: it allows a major version digit of "0", which would seem to be precluded by the way versions are currently defined.<br><br>Section 5: The XML definition allows zero or more&nbsp; elements to appear in a message. If more than one is allowed, the document should explain how multiple IDs are handled. If they are not, then the schema and/or text needs to prohibit having more than one.<br><br>Section 5: The description for&nbsp; says that a 402 will be sent in the case of an "unexpected" sequence number. This needs clarification: is this for case where a sequence number gap is detected? A repeated sequence number? A number that is too small? All of the above? At least describe this with the 402 error code, and point to that description from here.<br><br>Section 5: The description for&nbsp; would benefit from the addition of "This document describes version 1.0".<br><br>Section 5.1: "The OPTIONS message is sent by the CP which is the CI to the CP which is the CR as soon as the CLUE data channel is ready." Although it's a problem in other parts of the document too, the dense use of nearly identical two-letter acronyms in here makes it quite hard to read. I had to keep consulting the definitions of those acronyms to decode this sentence (as well as several similar ones). Consider just expanding these terms (as well as "MP" and "MC") instead of using them in prose.<br><br>Section 5.1 starts to wobble back and forth between referring to elements with and without angle brackets (e.g., it uses both "supportedVersions" and ""). Please pick one and stick with it.<br><br>BLOCKER: Section 5.1: The description of&nbsp; describes a scheme in which multiple supported versions can be listed; and, if the list is omitted, it implies that only the version described in&nbsp; is supported. This text does not define (nor does any other text that I can find) what&nbsp; should be set to when&nbsp; is used. Intuitively, it seems that&nbsp; should be set to the largest minor version of the smallest major version advertised in , but that (or whatever the correct answer is) needs to be clearly spelled out.<br><br>BLOCKER: Section 5.2: "If the responseCode is of the type 2xx the response MUST also include..." -- you can't use "2xx" in a normative statement without first defining what it means. As you don't use the "#xx" format anywhere else, I suggest rephrasing: "If the&nbsp; is between 200 and 299 inclusive, the response MUST also include..."<br><br>Sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.6: It seems really odd that the document defines a base clueMessageType that all messages derive from, but then leaves all the response types (optionsResponse, ack, configureResponse) to repeatedly and independently add ,, and the sequence number of the corresponding message over and over again. I would strongly suggest adding something like:<br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br><br>...and then defining those three response types as being extensions of "clueResponse" instead of "clueMessage", like this:<br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br><br>Regardless of how you do this, any section that adds "responseCode" and "reasonString" needs to point to section 5.7 in its description to explain how those fields are populated and interpreted.<br><br>Section 5.5: This section allows a boolean flag in a&nbsp; message to acknowledge an . Is this intended to always be handled like a 200? Consider: if you define a 201 response code in the future, will implementations be unable to convey its meaning in a CONF + ACK? Given that the document defines a class of codes for success rather than a simple success flag in general, it seems that this&nbsp; element should carry a success response code rather than just a boolean. If you decide to keep the boolean, be very clear that it is to be treated as a 200 rather than any other potential success code; and that conveying any other kind of success requires a separate&nbsp; message.<br><br>Section 5.5: the final paragraph mentions the&nbsp; element -- it would be helpful to add something like "see [I-D.ietf-clue-datamodel] for the definition of ."<br><br>BLOCKER: Section 5.7 indicates that there is a class of response codes, starting with "1", which are used to indicate "delayed or incomplete" responses. The document does not describe any protocol behavior for this class of response. The description of the meaning of this class (and the obvious parallels to HTTP and SIP) imply that some subsequent response associated with the same request will be arriving at some point in the future. If that's the intention, this document needs a *lot* more text (and corresponding adjustments to the state machines) to explain how these 100-class codes are handled. In practice, since the current version of the document does not define nor make use of 100-class codes, I suggest that the most reasonable path forward is to remove discussion of codes starting with "1" from the first paragraph of section 5.7, instead adding a paragraph immediately following it that says something like:<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not define response codes starting with "1", and such<br>&nbsp; response codes are not allowed to appear in major version 1 of the CLUE<br>&nbsp; protocol. The range from 100 to 199 inclusive is reserved for future major<br>&nbsp; versions of the protocol to define response codes for delayed or incomplete<br>&nbsp; operations if necessary. Response codes starting with "5" through "9" are<br>&nbsp; reserved for future major versions of the protocol to define new classes of<br>&nbsp; response, and are not allowed in major version 1 of the CLUE protocol.<br>&nbsp; Response codes starting with "0" are not allowed.<br><br>Section 5.7: "The response codes and strings defined for use with CLUE are as follows" - this strongly implies that the descriptions given in this table are the only ones that are allowed in CLUE&nbsp; element, and that any other messages should presumably be treated as an error. Surely that's not what you mean. Suggest rephrasing to indicate that the "Description" text can be sent in the , but that implementations can (and are encouraged to) include more specific descriptions of the error condition, if possible.<br><br>Section 5.7: I can't figure out how an implementation could ever send a "300" response code. If the XML syntax is incorrect, that's a 301. If the message contains an invalid value, that's a 302. And those are the only two conditions that are described for 300. I think you need to give "300" a bit more thought -- if you can't come up with a more generic description (e.g., "low-level request error"), you probably want to remove it.<br><br>Section 5.7: for 403, be clear which identifier is meant. Do you mean "The&nbsp; used in the message is not valid..."?<br><br>Section 5.7: for 404, please be clear that you're talking about the sequence number rather than just using "number" without qualification.<br><br>Section 5.7: The description for 405 uses the acronym "MCC" without expanding it. Please expand it.<br><br>BLOCKING: The state machines in section 6 and its subsections don't have transitions for all possible messages that could arrive in a state. This can cause interop issues. Please add text that clearly indicates whether such messages do or do not cause a transition. (This might be as simple as "messages not shown for a state do not cause the state to change," but only if you carefully check that this is true -- for example, what should an MP state machine do do if it gets a "CONF + ACK" in the state "WAIT FOR CONF"?)<br><br>Section 6: The fifth paragraph says "CLUE channel" where it means "CLUE data channel."<br><br>Section 6: The eighth paragraph says:<br><br>&nbsp;  The CP moves from the ACTIVE state to the IDLE one when the sub-state<br>&nbsp;  machines that have been activated are (both) in the relative<br>&nbsp;  TERMINATED state (see sections Section 6.1 and Section 6.2).<br><br>The "both" in this paragraph is confusing, since it's possible to have only one or the other machine running. Please rephrase.<br><br>Section 6.2 describes a state machine that starts in a state called "WAIT FOR ADV." This state does not appear to be timer-supervised, meaning that implementations of this state machine can stay in this state literally forever. Is that the intention?<br><br>Section 6.2 also describes the possibility of sending a&nbsp; and&nbsp; separately or as a combined message. I would have expected to see some discussion here about why implementations might choose one behavior over the other.<br><br>Section 7: The second sentence of the second paragraph needs a verb.<br><br>Section 7, paragraph 3: this claims that versions are a non-negative *integer* rather than a *digit*. As I mention above, this seems to be the right way to handle versions, but it is decidedly at odds with text elsewhere in the document and in the schema. Regardless of how you choose to treat versions, the text needs to be consistent.<br><br>Section 7, final paragraph: replace "Clue" with "CLUE."<br><br>Section 8 contains a paragraph starting with "In that case, the new information..." but it's not clear which case it's referring to. Please replace "In that case" with a description of the case under consideration.<br><br>Section 8 contains the phrase "Similarly to what said before..." -- this is ungrammatical and needs to be rephrased.<br><br>Section 8 indicates that extensions need to indicate "the standard version of the protocol the extension refers to." Given that there is compatibility within a major version of a protocol, I think this means to say "the major standard version of the protocol that the extension refers to."<br><br>Section 8 has a paragraph starting "For that reason..." -- it's not clear what reason is being referred to here. Please clarify.<br><br>Section 8 contains schema that contains a&nbsp; element. It should be clarified that this is the *protocol* version, not the *extension* version (or, if it's the extension version, that needs to be spelled out too, but I think you'll need a new namespace for that...?)<br><br>BLOCKING: Section 8.1 is an example section, which are non-normative in IETF documents. It contains 2119-style normative language, however. These normative statements need to be moved out of the example section (and probably into section 8). The remainder of this comment is non-blocking: I also find the "SHOULD" in this section to be highly perplexing. Can you explain the rationale behind requiring schema, but not requiring any description of what the schema *means?)<br><br>BLOCKING: The example in section 8.1 includes the following:<br><br>&nbsp;  xmlns="clue-info-extension-myVideoExtensions"<br><br>I'm pretty certain that namespaces are required to be identified by URIs rather than arbitrary strings.<br><br>Section 8.1: The final paragraph also has normative language in it, although it appears to be reiterating requirements from elsewhere in the document. I suggest lowercasing "MUST" in this paragraph.<br><br>Section 8.1: The final paragraph mentions the use of&nbsp; and&nbsp; to negotiate the extension.

In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; A Media Type review has *not* been requested.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Paul Kyzivat<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alissa Cooper<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The shepherd has been an active reviewer of this document throughout <br>&nbsp; its development, and reviewed it again in its entirety while preparing <br>&nbsp; this writeup. <br><br>&nbsp; In the view of this shepherd the document is ready for <br>&nbsp; publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has been well reviewed.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; The document contains an XML schema definition and examples<br>&nbsp; of XML documents using this schema and the one in the data<br>&nbsp; model draft. The authors are the people in the WG with the<br>&nbsp; most XML expertise. Others in the WG have reviewed the XML,<br>&nbsp; but are not experts. The document could benefit from a<br>&nbsp; review by an outside XML expert.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; None<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes, each author has stated they have no IPR claims on the document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR has been filed against this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong WG consensus for this document by all those who have<br>&nbsp; actively participated in the group. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; There are three long lines that need to be fixed.<br><br>&nbsp; There are a few other bogus warnings about line spacing and missing<br>&nbsp; references. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; As stated above, there has been no XML review. <br><br>&nbsp; (Looking back, I see that there was discussion of having both this<br>&nbsp; and the closely related CLUE schema document reviewed together.<br>&nbsp; But it appears that only the schema was reviewed.)<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; There are normative references to several other CLUE drafts.<br>&nbsp; The intent is that these will all progress together.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; There are no downrefs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document doesn't change the status of any other document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The IANA considerations section is in good order.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A - no new registries are defined.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; None. <br></div></td>
