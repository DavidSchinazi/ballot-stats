 Whichever approach is taken to representing the delegated resource,<br>&nbsp;  there are fundamental trade-offs regarding when and where in the<br>&nbsp;  architecture a delegation is validated: that is, when the delegated<br>&nbsp;  TNAuthList is checked to be "encompassed" by the TNAuthList of its<br>&nbsp;  parent.&nbsp; This might be performed at the time the delegate certificate<br>&nbsp;  is issued, or at the time that a verification service receives an<br>&nbsp;  inbound call, or potentially both.&nbsp; It is generally desirable to<br>&nbsp;  offload as much of this as possible to the certification process, as<br>&nbsp;  verification occurs during call setup and thus additional network<br>&nbsp;  dips could lead to perceptible delay, whereas certification happens<br>&nbsp;  outside of call processing as a largely administrative function.<br><br>I do see the response to my discuss point (6) that says the CA is<br>expected to always or nearly-always make the check, with addditional<br>check on the authentication/verification service for "belt and<br>suspenders".&nbsp; But this "might be performed at [...], or at [...]"<br>formulation is not very strong.&nbsp; Is there a granularity of scope<br>(deployment?) for which we can say "a given&nbsp; MUST specify at<br>least one point in processing where the encompassing check is<br>performed"?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  Authentication services SHOULD NOT use a delegate certificate without<br>&nbsp;  validating that its scope of authority is encompassed by that of its<br>&nbsp;  parent certificate, and if that certificate has its own parent, the<br>&nbsp;  entire certification path SHOULD be validated.<br><br>I see the response to my discuss point (6) that justifies the first<br>"SHOULD NOT" with an alternative scenario that works fine.&nbsp; In this<br>context is the second "entire certification path SHOULD be validate"<br>referring only to the validation of the phone number check?&nbsp; As written<br>it sounds like it could refer to the entire X.509 chain-building and<br>validation exercise, which kind of has to happen in order for the system<br>to work (but, IIRC, is also mandated as part of normal PASSporT<br>handling).&nbsp; So maybe we could tweak the wording a little bit here ("the<br>authorization for calling party number in the entire certification path<br>SHOULD be validated").<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note that the allocation to a service provider<br>&nbsp;  of a certificate with a basic constraints extension with the cA<br>&nbsp;  boolean set to "true" does not require that a service provider act as<br>&nbsp;  a certification authority itself; [...]<br><br>I am not sure if this text was intending to refer to the now-removed<br>behavior where the CA certificate directly signed the PASSporT or some<br>other scenario.&nbsp; If the latter, do we have an example of some sort that<br>we could point to (does a third-party authentication service that's<br>given the private key count)?<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  public key that could sign PASSporTs.&nbsp; The TLS subcerts system has<br>&nbsp;  furthermore exploring leveraging ACME to issue short-lived<br>&nbsp;  certificates for temporary delegation as a means of obviating the<br>&nbsp;  need for revocation.&nbsp; Specification of a mechanism similar to TLS<br><br>I don't think that subcerts and STAR are particularly closely related,<br>so mentioning "the TLS subcerts system" here doesn't seem right. <br>I might consider a rewording as:<br><br>NEW:<br>TLS subcerts provide a very time-limited means to issue a credential<br>that is used as a delegated version of a longer-lived credentials.&nbsp; A<br>similar technology being explored by ACME is short-lived certificates<br>that can be automatically renewed if the issued credentials/authority<br>are to remain valid.&nbsp; This is not explicitly a delegation mechanism, as<br>the issued credentials are issued directly by the ACME CA, but can<br>reflect a delegation of authority if the certificate and private key are<br>delegated to a different entity than the one that controls the ACME<br>account used for issuance.<br><br>&nbsp;  subcerts for STIR is future work, and will be undertaken only if the<br>&nbsp;  market require it.<br><br>nit: s/require/requires/<br><br>Section 12<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also that note if the HTTPS service housing<br>&nbsp;  the by-reference telephone number list is improperly secured, that<br>&nbsp;  too can lead to vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Ultimately, the CA that issued a<br>&nbsp;  delegated certificate populates the URL in the AIA field, and is<br>&nbsp;  responsible for making a secure selection.&nbsp; Service providers acting<br>&nbsp;  as CAs are directed to the cautionary words about running a CA in<br>&nbsp;  Section 8 regarding the obligations this entails for certificate<br>&nbsp;  revocation and so on.<br><br>I'm a little confused about the need to call out the AIA field here,<br>with the previous discussion having been about the use of by-reference<br>TNAuthLists.&nbsp; Isn't the AIA only going to contain information about the<br>CA itself that is doing the issuing?</div></td>

 Whichever approach is taken to representing the delegated resource,<br>&nbsp;  there are fundamental trade-offs regarding when and where in the<br>&nbsp;  architecture a delegation is validated: that is, when the delegated<br>&nbsp;  TNAuthList is checked to be "encompassed" by the TNAuthList of its<br>&nbsp;  parent.&nbsp; This might be performed at the time the delegate certificate<br>&nbsp;  is issued, or at the time that a verification service receives an<br>&nbsp;  inbound call, or potentially both.&nbsp; It is generally desirable to<br>&nbsp;  offload as much of this as possible to the certification process, as<br>&nbsp;  verification occurs during call setup and thus additional network<br>&nbsp;  dips could lead to perceptible delay, whereas certification happens<br>&nbsp;  outside of call processing as a largely administrative function.<br><br>I do see the response to my discuss point (6) that says the CA is<br>expected to always or nearly-always make the check, with addditional<br>check on the authentication/verification service for "belt and<br>suspenders".&nbsp; But this "might be performed at [...], or at [...]"<br>formulation is not very strong.&nbsp; Is there a granularity of scope<br>(deployment?) for which we can say "a given&nbsp; MUST specify at<br>least one point in processing where the encompassing check is<br>performed"?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  Authentication services SHOULD NOT use a delegate certificate without<br>&nbsp;  validating that its scope of authority is encompassed by that of its<br>&nbsp;  parent certificate, and if that certificate has its own parent, the<br>&nbsp;  entire certification path SHOULD be validated.<br><br>I see the response to my discuss point (6) that justifies the first<br>"SHOULD NOT" with an alternative scenario that works fine.&nbsp; In this<br>context is the second "entire certification path SHOULD be validate"<br>referring only to the validation of the phone number check?&nbsp; As written<br>it sounds like it could refer to the entire X.509 chain-building and<br>validation exercise, which kind of has to happen in order for the system<br>to work (but, IIRC, is also mandated as part of normal PASSporT<br>handling).&nbsp; So maybe we could tweak the wording a little bit here ("the<br>authorization for calling party number in the entire certification path<br>SHOULD be validated").<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note that the allocation to a service provider<br>&nbsp;  of a certificate with a basic constraints extension with the cA<br>&nbsp;  boolean set to "true" does not require that a service provider act as<br>&nbsp;  a certification authority itself; [...]<br><br>I am not sure if this text was intending to refer to the now-removed<br>behavior where the CA certificate directly signed the PASSporT or some<br>other scenario.&nbsp; If the latter, do we have an example of some sort that<br>we could point to (does a third-party authentication service that's<br>given the private key count)?<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  public key that could sign PASSporTs.&nbsp; The TLS subcerts system has<br>&nbsp;  furthermore exploring leveraging ACME to issue short-lived<br>&nbsp;  certificates for temporary delegation as a means of obviating the<br>&nbsp;  need for revocation.&nbsp; Specification of a mechanism similar to TLS<br><br>I don't think that subcerts and START are particularly closely related,<br>so mentioning "the TLS subcerts system" here doesn't seem right.&nbsp; I'm<br>also not entirely sure to what extent the ACME STAR work is specifically<br>intended as a *delegation* mechanism, though I do think I see the<br>analogy being made here.&nbsp; I might consider a rewording as:<br><br>NEW:<br>TLS subcerts provide a very time-limited means to issue a credential<br>that is used as a delegated version of a longer-lived credentials.&nbsp; A<br>similar technology being explored by ACME is short-lived certificates<br>that can be automatically renewed if the issued credentials/authority<br>are to remain valid.&nbsp; This is not explicitly a delegation mechanism, as<br>the issued credentials are issued directly by the ACME CA, but can<br>reflect a delegation of authority if the certificate and private key are<br>delegated to a different entity than the one that controls the ACME<br>account used for issuance.<br><br>&nbsp;  subcerts for STIR is future work, and will be undertaken only if the<br>&nbsp;  market require it.<br><br>nit: s/require/requires/<br><br>Section 12<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also that note if the HTTPS service housing<br>&nbsp;  the by-reference telephone number list is improperly secured, that<br>&nbsp;  too can lead to vulnerabilities.&nbsp; Ultimately, the CA that issued a<br>&nbsp;  delegated certificate populates the URL in the AIA field, and is<br>&nbsp;  responsible for making a secure selection.&nbsp; Service providers acting<br>&nbsp;  as CAs are directed to the cautionary words about running a CA in<br>&nbsp;  Section 8 regarding the obligations this entails for certificate<br>&nbsp;  revocation and so on.<br><br>I'm a little confused about the need to call out the AIA field here,<br>with the previous discussion having been about the use of by-reference<br>TNAuthLists.&nbsp; Isn't the AIA only going to contain information about the<br>CA itself that is doing the issuing?</div></td>

That said, though, it's general crypto best practice<br>to only use a given key for one type of operation, and "sign<br>certificates" and "sign JWTs" qualify as separate operations in this<br>sense.&nbsp;

 in Section 7.&nbsp; If the CSR presented to the ACME server is for a<br><br>This would seem to suggest that people actually use the ACME-provided<br>URL as the "x5u" URL.&nbsp; I don't remember anything in 8555 to suggest that<br>the ACME server is under any obligation to maintain this resource<br>indefinitely (or to allow GET access, vs the required POST-AS-GET), so<br>we should either disavow such a practice or document the relevant<br>considerations and preconditions for relying on the external party in<br>this way.<br><br>&nbsp;  Service providers that want the capability to rapidly revoke<br>&nbsp;  delegated certificates can rely on the ACME STAR [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-acme-star/">I-D.ietf-acme-star</a>]<br>&nbsp;  mechanism to automate the process of short-term certificate expiry.<br><br>We need to reword this.&nbsp; The STAR mechanism does not provide a<br>revocation mechanism; it merely attempts to obviate the need for an<br>active revocation mechanism.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>&nbsp;  placing calls.&nbsp; As this information is necessarily a superset of the<br>&nbsp;  calling party number that is openly signaled during call setup, the<br>&nbsp;  privacy risks associated with this mechanism are not substantially<br><br>If I understand correctly, "this information" is the information in the<br>parent CA certificate that issued the delegated STIR certificate (as<br>opposed to the delegated STIR certificate itself)?&nbsp;

since those topics are relevant for us<br>as well, it seems like we should at least do so ourselves even if we<br>can't retroactively make 8226 talk about it.<br><br>I would also suggest reiterating that since STIR certificates use the<br>TNAuthList, rather than conventional X.509 naming schemes, that the<br>"encompassing" check has to be added to the process for determining<br>whether a given certification chain is authorized and valid.&nbsp;
