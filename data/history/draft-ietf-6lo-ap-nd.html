 In this specification, a 6LN generates a cryptographic ID (Crypto-ID)<br>&nbsp;  and places it in the ROVR field during the registration of one (or<br>&nbsp;  more) of its addresses with the 6LR(s).&nbsp; Proof of ownership of the<br>&nbsp;  Crypto-ID is passed with the first registration exchange to a new<br>&nbsp;  6LR, and enforced at the 6LR.&nbsp; The 6LR validates ownership of the<br>&nbsp;  cryptographic ID before it creates any new registration state, or<br>&nbsp;  changes existing information.<br><br>I'll read on and see, but how much trust does this imply that we require of<br>all 6LRs (as opposed to the 6LBR, which is kind of required to be pretty<br>trusted)?&nbsp; [ed.: basically complete trust is required]<br><br>&nbsp;  The protected address registration protocol proposed in this document<br>&nbsp;  enables Source Address Validation (SAVI) [<a href="/doc/rfc7039/">RFC7039</a>].&nbsp; This ensures<br>&nbsp;  that only the actual owner uses a registered address in the IPv6<br>&nbsp;  source address field.&nbsp; A 6LN can only use a 6LR for forwarding<br>&nbsp;  packets only if it has previously registered the address used in the<br>&nbsp;  source field of the IPv6 packet.<br><br>nit: this last sentence is written as if we not only enable, but also<br>require, SAVI.<br><br>&nbsp;  The 6lo adaptation layer in [<a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC4944</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC6282</a>] requires a device<br>&nbsp;  to form its IPv6 addresses based on its Layer-2 address to enable a<br>&nbsp;  better compression.&nbsp; This is incompatible with Secure Neighbor<br>&nbsp;  Discovery (SeND) [<a href="/doc/rfc3971/">RFC3971</a>] and Cryptographically Generated Addresses<br>&nbsp;  (CGAs) [<a href="/doc/rfc3972/">RFC3972</a>], since they derive the Interface ID (IID) in IPv6<br>&nbsp;  addresses with cryptographic keys.<br><br>Are we going to have some further discussion of the scope of that loss of<br>functionality and/or alternative mechanisms to achieve those goals, or is<br>this statement just intended to note the incompatibility?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The proof requires the support of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)<br>&nbsp;  and that of a hash function as detailed in Section 6.2.&nbsp; To enable<br>&nbsp;  the verification of the proof, the registering node needs to supply<br>&nbsp;  certain parameters including a Nonce and a signature that will<br>&nbsp;  demonstrate that the node has the private-key corresponding to the<br>&nbsp;  public-key used to build the Crypto-ID.<br><br>nit: the proof itself may only indirectly involve a hash, since we use<br>non-prehash Ed25519 (but the hash function is still needed to generate the<br>Crypto-ID itself).<br><br>nit(?): I think we tend to see "possesses the private key" more often than "has<br>the private-key", for parallelism with the "proof of possession" term of<br>art.<br><br>&nbsp;  The elliptic curves and the hash functions that can be used with this<br>&nbsp;  specification are listed in Table 2 in Section 8.3.&nbsp; The signature<br>&nbsp;  scheme that specifies which combination is used is signaled by a<br><br>nit: this could be misread as saying that the Table is authoritative, not<br>the registry.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The Crypto-ID is derived from the public key and a modifier as<br>&nbsp;  follows:<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; The hash function indicated by the Crypto-Type is applied to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  CIPO.&nbsp; Note that all the reserved and padding bits MUST be set to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  zero.<br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; The leftmost bits of the resulting hash, up to the size of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ROVR field, are used as the Crypto-ID.<br><br>This construction seems to allow for some malleability, in that an attacker<br>who observes a given Crypto-ID and CIPO could produce a related, valid,<br>Crypto-ID by reducing the ROVR length and truncating what was received.&nbsp; I<br>haven't attempted to explore what (if any) potential consequences there are<br>of such malleability, and would like to know if anyone else has already done<br>so.&nbsp; It looks like the NDPSO construction includes the length of the<br>Crypto-ID, so it would be hard for an attacker to do much with such a<br>truncated Crypto-ID, but attacks only get better...<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>nit: I confess I'm missing what compels us to produce a de novo definition<br>of the "Status" field (and Length field) as opposed to deferring to the <a href="/doc/rfc8505/">RFC<br>8505</a> definition, as we do for most of the other fields.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;

Although the different signature schemes target<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; similar cryptographic strength, they rely on different curves,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash functions, signature algorithms, and/or representation<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conventions.<br><br>While the currently-defined signature schemes target similar cryptographic<br>strength, do we need to imply that all future ones will also target a<br>similar strength (especially since Section 8.3 admits the possibility of<br>"better security")?<br><br>&nbsp;  Modifier:&nbsp; 8-bit unsigned integer.&nbsp; Set to an arbitrary value by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; creator of the Crypto-ID.&nbsp; The role of the modifier is to enable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the formation of multiple Crypto-IDs from a same key pair, which<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reduces the traceability and thus improves the privacy of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; constrained node that could not maintain many key-pairs.<br><br>It may be worth digging in a little further to the threat model being<br>addressed here -- while I laud the ability to have multiple Crypto-IDs from<br>a single keypair, it seems that the tracking-prevention this affords implies<br>an attacker who can observe Crypto-IDs, most likely at multiple points in<br>the network.&nbsp; Are Crypto-IDs used for anything other than EAROs?&nbsp; I don't<br>have a great sense for how likely it is that an attacker in position to<br>observe (a subset of) EAROs would not also be in a position to observe at<br>least one associated CIPO, which includes all the information needed to<br>generate the Crypto-ID other than the Modifier.&nbsp; With only an 8-bit Modifier<br>space, brute-forcing the other possible Crypto-IDs for that keypair is not<br>terribly strenuous, whereas allowing for a (potentially variable length?)<br>larger Modifier, say 64 bits, would substantially increase the work-factor<br>needed to predict (and store!) other Crypto-IDs that might be used for this<br>keypair.&nbsp; Given that the CIPO already carries the public key itself, it's<br>not entirely clear how space-constrained we are so as to limit this to just<br>8 bits of modifier.<br><br>&nbsp;  Padding:&nbsp; A variable-length field completing the Public Key field to<br>&nbsp;

 As opposed to the RSA Signature Option (RSAO) defined in section 5.2.<br>&nbsp;  of SEND [<a href="/doc/rfc3971/">RFC3971</a>], the NDPSO does not have a key hash field.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  hash that can be used as index is the 128 leftmost bits of the ROVR<br>&nbsp;  field in the EARO.<br><br>nit: this last sentence perhaps leaves more context implicit than the reader<br>might like; I suggest "Instead, the leftmost 128 bits of the ROVR field in<br>the sibling EARO are used to lookup the key used for signature verification,<br>[left-padded with zeros if needed]".&nbsp; (I added the part in square brackets<br>because I'm not sure that anything guarantees the ROVR will actually contain<br>128 bits -- when AP-ND is not in use its typically just 64 bits, right?)<br><br>&nbsp;

 trying to attract traffic for that address or use it as their source<br>&nbsp;  address.<br><br>nit: I think that the verification cannot be done unilaterally by the 6LR,<br>so maybe "enables the 6LR to challenge the node to verify its ownership of<br>the binding at any time" is better.<br><br>&nbsp;  A node may use multiple IPv6 addresses at the same time.&nbsp; The node<br>&nbsp;  MAY use the same Crypto-ID, to prove the ownership of multiple IPv6<br>&nbsp;  addresses.&nbsp; The separation of the address and the cryptographic<br><br>nit: no comma<br><br>&nbsp;  material avoids the constrained device to compute multiple keys for<br><br>nit: "avoids the need for"<br><br>&nbsp;  multiple addresses.&nbsp; The registration process allows the node to use<br>&nbsp;  the same Crypto-ID for all of its addresses.<br><br>nit(?): We could potentially mention again the ability to use different<br>Crypto-IDs with a single keypair, though there's not any clear need to do<br>so.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>Mostly just for my own elucidation, where is it first specified to put the<br>address being registered in the Target Address field of the NS message?<br><br>&nbsp;  detrimental to the battery lifetime.&nbsp; Alternatively, the device may<br>&nbsp;  use an always-incrementing value saved in the same stable storage as<br>&nbsp;  the key, so they are lost together, and starting at a best effort<br>&nbsp;  random value, either as Nonce value or as a component to its<br>&nbsp;  computation.<br><br>nit: "as the Nonce value".<br><br>&nbsp;  and the NDPSO containing the signature.&nbsp; The information associated<br>&nbsp;  to a Crypto-ID stored by the 6LR on the first NS exchange where it<br>&nbsp;  appears.&nbsp; The 6LR MUST store the CIPO parameters associated with the<br><br>nit: I think there's a verb missing in this sentence ("MUST be"?)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |------- NS with EARO, CIPO, NonceLN and NDPSO --------&gt;|<br><br>(This still includes the Crypto-ID, even if there's not room in the figure<br>to explicition indicate that, right?)<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Upon the first exchange with a 6LR, a 6LN will be challenged to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prove ownership of the Crypto-ID and the Target Address being<br><br>How is the "first exchange" tracked?&nbsp; Just whether the 6LR knows about the<br>registered IPv6 address, or the L2 address, or something else?&nbsp; In<br>particular, if a 6LR has cached an IP address/ROVR binding, and an attacker<br>tries to join that 6LR with that address/ROVR, what controls whether the 6LR<br>will challenge the attacker's 6LN?&nbsp; Is it purely at the 6LR's discretion?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The challenge is triggered when the registration for a Source<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link-Layer Address is not verifiable either at the 6LR or the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6LBR.&nbsp; In the latter case, the 6LBR returns a status of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Validation Requested" in the DAR/DAC exchange, which is echoed by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the 6LR in the NA (EARO) back to the registering node.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; challenge MUST NOT alter a valid registration in the 6LR or the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6LBR.<br><br>nit(?): the previous bullet describes a case where the 6LR MUST issue a<br>challenge; my understanding is that this bullet describes an additional way<br>in which challenges can occur (i.e., when the 6LBR doesn't know about the<br>address registration either).&nbsp; Stylistically, it might be more clear to<br>reword this as being an "additional case" on top of the previous one, as<br>opposed to the current wording which tries to be very general about when a<br>challenge can happen, which is neither a parallel construction to the<br>previous bullet nor particularly clear about what new information is being<br>conveyed by this bullet.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; In order to validate the ownership, the 6LR performs the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; steps as the 6LN and rebuilds the Crypto-ID based on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parameters in the CIPO.&nbsp; If the rebuilt Crypto-ID matches the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ROVR, the 6LN also verifies the signature contained in the NDPSO<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option.&nbsp; If at that point the signature in the NDPSO option can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; verified, then the validation succeeds.&nbsp; Otherwise the validation<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fails.<br><br>I worry a little bit that we haven't fully specified the entire list of<br>steps the 6LR takes to follow the cryptographic chain and validate that the<br>6LN holds the key in question and registers the address in question to the<br>Crypto-ID in question.&nbsp; I don't have a specific thing in mind that the 6LR<br>might forget, but if we explicitly state what things are bound to what other<br>things, the 6LR is less likely to make a security-relevant mistake.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>Might we want to include the Modifier or the Crypto-ID itself in the signed<br>data, in addition to the public key, to avoid any potential misbinding?<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; JWK-encoded public key<br><br>[just to check: JWK-encoding means that we have an injective map and aren't<br>subject to some sort of extension attack?&nbsp; Not that such a thing would be<br>easy to pull off, with a strict registry of Crypto-Types, of course]<br><br>&nbsp;  6.&nbsp; The length of the ROVR field in the NS message containing the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Crypto-ID that was sent.<br><br>nit: is this really the NS "that was sent" as opposed to the NS under<br>construction that contains the NDPSO?&nbsp; (This is related to my question up in<br>Section 6.1.)&nbsp; Tying the initial NS to the followup one requires more state<br>on the 6LR (though the 6LR probably already had to keep state for the Nonce)<br>and makes some of the verification steps a bit tougher to implement<br>correctly.<br><br>&nbsp;  7.&nbsp; 1-byte (in network byte order) Crypto-Type value sent in the CIPO<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  option.<br><br>nit: Is there any byte order with distinct representation from network byte<br>order, for a 1-byte quantity?&nbsp; ;)<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Depending on the Crypto-Type, apply the hash function on this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; concatenation.<br><br>nit: is this clearer as "Apply the hash function (if any) specified by the<br>Crypto-Type to the concatenated data"?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Depending on the Crypto-Type, sign the hash output with ECDSA (if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; curve P-256 is used) or sign the hash with EdDSA (if curve Ed25519<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (PureEdDSA)).<br><br>nit: this text is not very consistent with the idea of an extensible<br>registry of Crypto-Types; similar "apply the signature algorithm specified<br>by the Crypto-Type" language to what I suggested above may be appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp;  The 6LR on receiving the NDPSO and CIPO options first regenerates the<br>&nbsp;  Crypto-ID based on the CIPO option to make sure that the leftmost<br>&nbsp;  bits up to the size of the ROVR match.&nbsp; If and only if the check is<br><br>In the vein of my previous questions about where the Crypto-ID appears and<br>truncation/malleability, this text seems to leave some room for confusion<br>about how many bits of output are being compared, and compared to what.<br><br>&nbsp;

Verify the signature with the public-key received and the locally<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; computed values.&nbsp; If the verification succeeds, the 6LR and 6LBR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add the state information about the Crypto-ID, public-key and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Target Address being registered to their database.<br><br>This might be a place to reiterate the FCFS nature of address registration,<br>though it's hardly necessary.<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  In a multihop 6LoWPAN, a 6LBR sends RAs with prefixes downstream and<br>&nbsp;  the 6LR receives and relays them to the nodes. 6LR and 6LBR<br>&nbsp;  communicate using ICMPv6 Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and<br>&nbsp;  Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC) messages.&nbsp; The DAR and DAC use<br>&nbsp;  the same message format as NS and NA, but have different ICMPv6 type<br>&nbsp;  values.<br><br>&nbsp;  In AP-ND we extend DAR/DAC messages to carry cryptographically<br>&nbsp;  generated ROVR.&nbsp; In a multihop 6LoWPAN, the node exchanges the<br>&nbsp;  messages shown in Figure 6.&nbsp; The 6LBR must identify who owns an<br>&nbsp;  address (EUI-64) to defend it, if there is an attacker on another<br>&nbsp;  6LR.<br><br>This description feels a little vague to me -- I'm interested in knowing how<br>the 6LBR gains confidence that a proof-of-possession was provided to the<br>6LR, and how the ROVR gets validated at 6LBR and 6LR when the 6LN in<br>question moves to a new 6LR.&nbsp; What information remains local to (each) 6LR<br>and what is communicated between 6LR and 6LBR?<br>This also relates to the "how trusted are 6LRs?" question I mentioned<br>earlier.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>It might be appropriate to talk about how the NonceLR and NonceLN combine to<br>ensure contributory behavior from both 6LR and 6LN, and that each protects<br>against a different type of replay attack.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Duplicate Address Detection DoS Attack:&nbsp; Inside the LLN, Duplicate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Addresses are sorted out using the ROVR, which differentiates it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from a movement.&nbsp; DAD coming from the backbone are not forwarded<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; over the LLN, which provides some protection against DoS attacks<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inside the resource-constrained part of the network.&nbsp; Over the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; backbone, the EARO option is present in NS/NA messages.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; protects against misinterpreting a movement for a duplication, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enables the backbone routers to determine which one has the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; freshest registration and is thus the best candidate to validate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the registration for the device attached to it.&nbsp; But this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specification does not guarantee that the backbone router claiming<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an address over the backbone is not an attacker.<br><br>Where do we specify the behavior of the 6LBR to reject EAROs when the 6LBR<br>is not the one with the freshest registration?&nbsp; Or do I misunderstand the<br>discussion of "freshest registration"?<br><br>&nbsp;  Replay Attacks&nbsp; Using Nonces (NonceLR and NonceLN) generated by both<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the 6LR and 6LN provides an efficient protection against replay<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attacks of challenge response flow.&nbsp; The quality of the protection<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still depends on the quality of the Nonce, in particular of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; random generator if they are computed that way.<br><br>It's probably worth noting explicitly that we do not require unpredictable<br>nonces, just non-repeating ones.<br><br>&nbsp;  Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack:&nbsp; A rogue node that managed to access<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the L2 network may form many addresses and register them using AP-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ND.&nbsp; The perimeter of the attack is all the 6LRs in range of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attacker.&nbsp; The 6LR MUST protect itself against overflows and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reject excessive registration with a status 2 "Neighbor Cache<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full".&nbsp; This effectively blocks another (honest) 6LN from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registering to the same 6LR, but the 6LN may register to other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6LRs that are in its range but not in that of the rogue.<br><br>Are there L2 technologies where L2 media keys are tied to L2 address, so a<br>rogue node might be rate-limited or given a quota based on L2 address?<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  address.&nbsp; This specification frees the device to form its addresses<br>&nbsp;  in any fashion, thereby enabling not only 6LoWPAN compression which<br>&nbsp;  derives IPv6 addresses from Layer-2 addresses but also privacy<br>&nbsp;  addresses.<br><br>We noted in Section 1 that the 6lo adaptation layer requires use of<br>L2-address-based IPv6 address selection, so it's not clear how it would be<br>valid to use privacy addresses with this specification.<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>We seem to be assuming for these calculations/discussion that the hash used<br>for calculating the Crypto-ID is a well-behaved cryptographic hash and thus<br>that random collisions are the only ones possible.&nbsp;

 the edge of the network, between the 6LN and its 6LR.&nbsp; The central<br>&nbsp;  6LBR is offloaded, which avoids DOS attacks targeted at that central<br>&nbsp;  entity.&nbsp; This also saves back and forth exchanges across a<br><br>nit: "the central 6LBR is offloaded" reads very oddly, as the offloading is<br>of work from the 6LBR, but the 6LBR itself remains in place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The downside is that the 6LBR needs to trust the 6LR for performing<br>&nbsp;  the checking adequately, and the communication between the 6LR and<br>&nbsp;  the 6LBR must be protected to avoid tempering with the result of the<br>&nbsp;  test.<br><br>I'd prefer to see some more details about the nature of the required<br>protection for 6LR/6LBR communications.<br><br>&nbsp;  If a 6LR is compromised, it may pretend that it owns any address and<br>&nbsp;
