Three times in the new Section 3.7 you refer to "byte arrays":<br><br>&nbsp;  original draft intended that these strings would be treated as byte<br>&nbsp;  arrays where each byte would represent a US-ASCII character.<br><br>&nbsp;  Where specifically mentioned, data fields contain arrays of arbitrary<br>&nbsp;  bytes as required for protocol processing.<br><br>&nbsp;  All other text fields in TACACS+ MUST be treated as printable byte<br>&nbsp;  arrays of US-ASCII<br><br>I'm sort of OK with the use of "arrays of arbitrary bytes" in the second case, as you're not talking about character strings, though we usually reserve "array" to refer to a particular data structure with a particular mechanism of access.&nbsp; But I won't quibble about that.&nbsp; In the other two cases, it seems an odd distraction, and I wish you would use "strings" instead of "arrays".<br><br>2. In many places in the document you have added a space after ")" or "]".&nbsp; For example, "For IPv6 address text representation defined please see <a href="/doc/rfc5952/">RFC 5952</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc5952/">RFC5952</a>] ." and "For more details please refer to security section (Section 10) ."&nbsp; Why did you do that?&nbsp; The RFC Editor will only have to take them back out, so I recommend that you take them out now, instead.<br><br>Again, thanks for the update and for addressing my DISCUSS.</div></td>

Without out it "printable" has no meaning.<br><br>&nbsp;  special consideration given to user field and data fields used for<br>&nbsp;  passwords.<br><br>&nbsp;  To ensure interoperability of current deployments, the TACACS+ client<br>&nbsp;  and server MUST handle user fields and those data fields used for<br>&nbsp;  passwords as 8-bit octet strings.&nbsp; The deployment operator MUST<br>&nbsp;  ensure that consistent character encoding is applied from the end<br>&nbsp;  client to the server.&nbsp; The encoding SHOULD be UTF-8, and other<br><br>Please add Normative <a href="/doc/rfc3629/">RFC 3629</a> reference here for UTF-8.<br><br>&nbsp;  encodings outside printable US-ASCII SHOULD be deprecated.<br><br>I am not sure what this mean. You didn't define allowed encoding (really you mean charsets).<br><br>2) In 5.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  The printable US-ASCII name of the client port on which the<br>&nbsp;  authentication is taking place,<br><br>This doesn't mean anything. Is there a registry? It doesn't look like you are using transport service name registry for this.<br>Is it a fixed list?<br><br>&nbsp;  and its length in bytes.&nbsp; The value<br>&nbsp;  of this field is client specific.&nbsp; (For example, Cisco uses "tty10"<br>&nbsp;  to denote the tenth tty line and "Async10" to denote the tenth async<br>&nbsp;  interface).&nbsp; The port_len indicates the length of the port field, in<br>&nbsp;  bytes.<br><br>3) Later in 5.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  A printable US-ASCII string indicating the remote location from which<br>&nbsp;  the user has connected to the client.&nbsp; It is intended to hold a<br>&nbsp;  network address<br><br>What are the allowed formats for IPv4 and IPv6?

But it also contemplates the prospect of new implementations.

If new implementations are not expected, then the reference to new implementations should be removed.<br><br>9) How is "secure deployment" defined?

Usually we use titles like “Company X’s TACACS+ protocol”; this is probably not applicable here but maybe something like “Documentation of the TACACS+ Protocol” would work as well…?<br><br>2) If Single Connection Mode is used and the connection is idle for a while, it can be possible that some middlebox or the server lost state and the connection is actually not available anymore. I guess it could be good to explicit mention this case and say something like if a RST or timeout is encountered for a connection in Single Connection Mode, the client should try to open a new connection and resend the request immediately.<br><br>3) I would recommend to define the term “session” in section 3 (as it seems to a central term that is important to understand correctly).<br><br>4) Sec 10.5.1: “TACACS+ servers MUST NOT leak sensitive data.”<br>Not sure if that is an actionable requirement, as I would assume leaking is often done by accident. <br>Maybe “TACACS+ servers MUST store sensitive data securely.”… or something…?

You mention briefly somewhere that this is/was used for debugging but then later say that modern tools should also support debugging of obfuscated traffic.<br><br>6) Sec 10.5.5: “TACACS+ servers SHOULD deprecate the redirection mechanism.”<br>I believe you want to use a MUST here because you anyway only specify this for servers that follow or update to this spec; it will of course not change existing implementations…</div></td>

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>This document is intended to be an Informational RFC that describes the TACACS+ protocol the way it is implemented _today_.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; This document is not intending to change TACACS+ or address the security issues inherent within it.&nbsp; It is setting the stage for enhancing the security of TACACS+, but it is only aimed at adding referential context on how TACACS+ is implemented currently.&nbsp; As such Informational is the right status for this document.<br><br>The intended Informational status is clearly mentioned in the header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; TACACS+ provides Device Administration for routers, network access<br>&nbsp; servers and other networked computing devices via one or more<br>&nbsp; centralized servers.&nbsp; This document describes the protocol that is<br>&nbsp; used by TACACS+.&nbsp; In particular, this document describes the TACACS+ protocol the way it is&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; currently implemented and does not attempt to modify any of its inherent security issues.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Initially, this document described both the current TACACS+ protocol implementation plus extensions to allow for T+ over TLS.&nbsp; The working group though this muddied the water too much, and it was desired to first document the TACACS+ protocol as it stands today as an informational document.&nbsp; Once that document was ratified, a new document would be submitted for properly securing TACACS+ with TLS.<br><br>There was broad WG support for documenting TACACS+ as it is widely used and implemented in the industry.&nbsp; However, there were some procedural issues with how this document evolved.&nbsp; One WG member was particular vocal, initially in his objection to adding another AAA protocol, but then on how the document authorship was handled.&nbsp; As mentioned, the WG saw value in documenting this given its ubiquity.&nbsp; But the authorship of the document could have been handled better.<br><br>The problems included:<br><br>* The authors were slow to respond to comments initially<br>* The authors did no summarize changes revision-over-revision of the document<br>* A large amount of text was contributed by a working group member, but that member was not acknowledged in the text<br>* Some comments went a long while without being addressed<br><br>By the end of the process, all of these items had been addressed and author response had increased and improved.<br><br>Additionally, a section was added to the document to attempt to mitigate some of the known security issues by offering some best practices in terms of deployment.&nbsp; These practices do not alter the protocol itself but can help mitigate potential security issues.<br><br>Finally, a call for implementations was done to confirm that known implementations in the wild adhere to this.&nbsp; Numerous vendors and clients responded including Cisco, Huawei, Aviatnet, and FreeRADIUS that indicate their implementation adheres to this document with varying levels of support of various protocol options.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; It is strongly believed this document adequately and completely describes the TACACS+ protocol as it exists today.&nbsp; See above with respect to known implementations that adhere to this document.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd is Joe Clarke and the associated AD is Ignas Bogdonas.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I have read this document and commented on it to the authors and WG.&nbsp; I feel it is ready to go to the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>I feel this document has been fully reviewed and has had multiple comments and corrections.<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>Obviously, security is going to be a sticking point.&nbsp; But as I have mentioned above, the intent is to define the protocol as it exists currently.&nbsp; It is known that there are security issues.&nbsp; The document describes those and offers some suggestions to mitigate.&nbsp; IESG members should keep this in mind.&nbsp; The ultimate goal is to improve the security of TACACS+ in a new document to be defined after this one completes.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I have no concerns with the document at this point.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes, all authors have stated there is no known IPR.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>This document has reached consensus after much consternation from certain WG members.&nbsp; Those members have provided substantive comments and have helped increase the integrity of this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>I will send a separate email.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>None.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Not yet.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>There are no IANA considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br><br></div></td>
