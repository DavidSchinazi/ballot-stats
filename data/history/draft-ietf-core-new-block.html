Note I've added two new ones at the end of the list.<br><br>(<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-new-block/11/">draft-ietf-core-new-block-11</a>)<br><br>1. Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This mechanism is not intended for general CoAP usage, and any use<br>&nbsp;  outside the intended use case should be carefully weighed against the<br>&nbsp;  loss of interoperability with generic CoAP applications.<br><br>I’m curious: is the only reason the mechanism isn’t intended for general usage, the fact some implementations won’t support it? Or does it have other deficiencies that also make it unsuitable?<br><br><br>2. Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Q-Block2 Option is useful with GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, and<br>&nbsp;  iPATCH requests and their payload-bearing responses (2.01, 2.02,<br>&nbsp;  2.03, 2.04, and 2.05) (Section 5.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>I found the list of codes incomprehensible on first encountering it, since the concept of response codes hadn’t been introduced yet. I do understand that the document assumes familiarity with CoAP; nonetheless for basic clarity I think this should say “(response codes 2.01, 2.02…”. Additionally, the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> §5.5 doesn’t seem to be especially germane?<br><br>By the way, is 2.03 indeed a payload-bearing response? The only other place the spec touches on it is in §4.4, which says “the server could respond with a 2.03 (Valid) response with no payload”.<br><br><br>3. Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To indicate support for Q-Block2 responses, the CoAP client MUST<br>&nbsp;  include the Q-Block2 Option in a GET or similar request (FETCH, for<br>&nbsp;  example), the Q-Block2 Option in a PUT or similar request, or the<br>&nbsp;  Q-Block1 Option in a PUT or similar request so that the server knows<br>&nbsp;  that the client supports this Q-Block functionality should it need to<br>&nbsp;  send back a body that spans multiple payloads.&nbsp; Otherwise, the server<br>&nbsp;  would use the Block2 Option (if supported) to send back a message<br>&nbsp;  body that is too large to fit into a single IP packet [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>].<br><br>Is this paragraph really supposed to mention both Q-Block2 and Q-Block1? In particular, I’m confused by the mention of both of these in relation to PUT. <br><br><br>4. Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options are unsafe to forward.&nbsp; That is, a<br>&nbsp;  CoAP proxy that does not understand the Q-Block1 (or Q-Block2) Option<br>&nbsp;  MUST reject the request or response that uses either option.<br><br>Presumably (hopefully) this is simply describing the behavior of existing spec-compliant proxies when processing the new messages. As such, is the MUST appropriate? I would think not.<br><br><br>5. Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body.&nbsp; Note that the last received payload may not be the one with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the highest block number.<br><br>“Might not” would be less ambiguous than “may not”. <br><br><br>6. Section 4.4 (also two places in §4.3)<br><br>(This comment rehashes, in more detail, the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br><br>I read this as meaning the client should wait for as little as zero, or as long as NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT — that’s my understanding of “up to”. Is that the intended meaning? If it is, I think it’s worth writing out as I’ve done, for clarity. If it’s not, it definitely needs to be fixed. <br><br>There’s a similar issue with “up to NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT” later in the section. <br><br>Referring ahead to Section 7.2 muddies the waters further. Even though the text quoted above says NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT is an upper limit on how long to wait, §7.2 says it’s a lower limit instead... maybe? From §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT is the initial maximum time to wait for a missing<br><br>“Maximum”, ok great, that means “upper bound” and so lines up with §4.4 although the “initial” is surprising since §4.4 doesn’t say anything about the upper limit increasing. It continues:<br><br>&nbsp;  payload before requesting retransmission for the first time.&nbsp; Every<br>&nbsp;  time the missing payload is re-requested, the time to wait value<br>&nbsp;  doubles.&nbsp; The time to wait is calculated as:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time-to-Wait = NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT * (2 ** (Re-Request-Count - 1))<br><br>But this part says it’s (a) an exact time-to-wait, not a “maximum”, and (b) it says it increases exponentially, so NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT isn’t a maximum at all, but a minimum. <br><br>This later text in §7.2 implies that perhaps the problem in the above passages is the word “maximum”, and it should simply be deleted:<br><br>&nbsp;  For the server receiving NON Q-Block1 requests, it SHOULD send back a<br>&nbsp;  2.31 (Continue) Response Code on receipt of all of the MAX_PAYLOADS<br>&nbsp;  payloads to prevent the client unnecessarily delaying.&nbsp; If not all of<br>&nbsp;  the MAX_PAYLOADS payloads were received, the server SHOULD delay for<br>&nbsp;  NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (exponentially scaled based on the repeat request<br>&nbsp;  count for a payload) before sending the 4.08 (Request Entity<br>&nbsp;  Incomplete) Response Code for the missing payload(s).&nbsp; <br><br>Similarly “up to” in the quote that began this comment should be “at least”. <br><br>Whether you adopt those suggestions or not,&nbsp; it seems as though all this needs to be rewritten with careful attention to conveying what the desired behavior is. <br><br>But the plot thickens. Later in §7.2 we have<br><br>&nbsp;  It is likely that the client will start transmitting the next set of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads before the server times out on waiting for the<br>&nbsp;  last of the previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads.&nbsp; On receipt of the first<br>&nbsp;  payload from the new set of MAX_PAYLOADS payloads, the server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  send a 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) Response Code indicating any<br>&nbsp;  missing payloads from any previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads. <br><br>The point being that the retransmission request can be triggered by an event other than timer expiration. So in that sense, “maximum” is right — it provides an upper bound on how long to wait before requesting a retransmission — but in another sense it’s wrong because the exponential increase is applied to it. I think the word “maximum” is trying to do too much work, and more words are probably required in order to make this clear. I also think the problem is exacerbated by the fact both §4.4 and §7.2 are talking normatively about how to use NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. It seems as though the main description is found in §7.2, and some confusion would be avoided by making §4.4 less specific, and simply referring forward to §7.2.<br><br>And, as noted in my DISCUSS, example 10.2.3 muddies the waters still further since it illustrates yet another behavior.<br><br><br>7. Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br>&nbsp;  after the last received payload for NON payloads before issuing a<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or<br>&nbsp;  more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing blocks with the M bit<br>&nbsp;  unset.&nbsp; The client MAY set the M bit to request this and later blocks<br>&nbsp;  from this MAX_PAYLOADS set.&nbsp; Further considerations related to the<br>&nbsp;  transmission timing for missing requests are discussed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.2.<br><br>I find this whole paragraph pretty confusing with the dueling SHOULD and MAY, where it appears the SHOULD might be doing two jobs at once. I *think* your intent is something like the following?<br><br>“The client SHOULD wait as specified in Section 7.2 for NON payloads before requesting retransmission of any missing blocks. Retransmission is requested by issuing a GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing block(s). Generally the M bit on the Q-Block option(s) SHOULD be unset, although the M bit MAY be set to request this and later blocks from this MAX_PAYLOADS set, see Section 10.2.4 for an example of this in operation.”<br><br><br>8. Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  If the size of the 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) response packet<br>&nbsp;  is larger than that defined by Section 4.6 [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>], then the number<br>&nbsp;  of missing blocks MUST be limited so that the response can fit into a<br>&nbsp;  single packet.&nbsp; If this is the case, then the server can send<br><br>Suggestion: “then the number of missing blocks reported MUST...” (The thing being limited is not the actual number of missing blocks. You’re limiting the number you report on.)<br><br><br>9. Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  It is implementation specific as to whether there should be any<br>&nbsp;  further requests for missing data as there will have been significant<br>&nbsp;  transmission failure as individual payloads will have failed after<br>&nbsp;  MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN.<br><br>This paragraph seems as though it’s a non-sequitur. It just doesn’t make sense to me. :-(<br><br><br>10. Section 7.2<br><br>(This comment relates to the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>&nbsp;  NON_TIMEOUT is the maximum period of delay between sending sets of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads for the same body.&nbsp; By default, NON_TIMEOUT has<br>&nbsp;  the same value as ACK_TIMEOUT (Section 4.8 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>Presumably the use of “maximum” means it’s fine to delay zero seconds (or any value lower than NON_TIMEOUT). <br><br><br>11. General<br><br>By the way, none of the timers specify jitter (and indeed, if read literally, jitter would be forbidden). Is this intentional?<br><br><br>12. Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the CoAP peer reports at least one payload has not arrived for<br>&nbsp;  each body for at least a 24 hour period and it is known that there<br>&nbsp;  are no other network issues over that period, then the value of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS can be reduced by 1 at a time (to a minimum of 1) and<br>&nbsp;  the situation re-evaluated for another 24 hour period until there is<br>&nbsp;  no report of missing payloads under normal operating conditions.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  newly derived value for MAX_PAYLOADS should be used for both ends of<br>&nbsp;  this particular CoAP peer link.&nbsp; Note that the CoAP peer will not<br>&nbsp;  know about the MAX_PAYLOADS change until it is reconfigured.&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  consequence of the two peers having different MAX_PAYLOADS values, a<br>&nbsp;  peer may continue indicate that there are some missing payloads as<br>&nbsp;  all of its MAX_PAYLOADS set may not have arrived.&nbsp; How the two peer<br>&nbsp;  values for MAX_PAYLOADS are synchronized is out of the scope.<br><br>I take it this is just thrown in here as an operational suggestion? It’s not specifying protocol, right? It seems a little misplaced, if so.<br><br><br>13. Section 10.1.3<br><br>(This comment relates to the aside in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t the server request 1,9,10 in one go? Since its rxmt request is triggered by rx of 11, one would think it could infer 10 had been lost. <br><br>14. Section 10.1.4 (also 10.3.3)<br><br>(This comment relates to the aside in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of a message with More=0 trigger the server to request retransmission of the missing block? Why does it have to wait for timeout?<br><br>15. Section 10.2.3<br><br>(This comment relates to my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of QB2:10/0/1024 trigger the client to request retransmission? Why does it have to wait for timeout? Similarly reception of QB2:9/1/1024 later in the example. <br><br>16. Section 10.2.4<br><br>Since MAX_PAYLOADS is 10, why does the example say “MAX_PAYLOADS has been reached” after payloads 2-9 have been retransmitted? That’s only 8 payloads.<br><br>-- <br> I do have a couple new comments raised during my review of the changes in version 12:<br><br>(<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-new-block/12/">draft-ietf-core-new-block-12</a>)<br><br>17. Section 1:<br><br>&nbsp; This document introduces the CoAP Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options which<br>&nbsp; allow block-wise transfer to work with series of Non-confirmable<br>&nbsp; messages, instead of lock-stepping using Confirmable messages<br>&nbsp; (Section 3).&nbsp; In other words, this document provides a missing piece<br>&nbsp; of [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>], namely the support of block-wise transfer using Non-<br>&nbsp; confirmable where an entire body of data can be transmitted without<br>&nbsp; the requirement for an acknowledgement (but recovery is available<br>&nbsp; should it be needed).<br><br>As far as I can tell the spec does not really remove the requirement for acknowledgement, it just amortizes the acknowledgements by only sending them every MAX_PAYLOADS_SET. Response Code 2.31 is essentially an acknowledgement, and it gets sent that frequently, right? There’s also (if I recall correctly) some flavor of acknowledgement that is sent when the entire body has been transferred. So, I think the new paragraph isn’t accurate.<br><br>This observation also applies to this claimed benefit in §3:<br><br>&nbsp; o&nbsp; They support sending an entire body using NON messages without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  requiring an intermediate response from the peer.<br><br>Response Code 2.31 is exactly an intermediate response. I guess maybe your focus is that if the intermediate response isn’t received, transmission continues, albeit more slowly than it would otherwise, and unreliably too, so in that sense the responses aren’t “required”. I think this requires awfully close parsing of the word “required”, though.<br><br>18. Section 2:<br><br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET is the set of blocks identified by block numbers<br>&nbsp; that, when divided by MAX_PAYLOADS, they have the same numeric<br><br>Remove “they” <br><br>&nbsp; result.&nbsp; For example, if MAX_PAYLOADS is set to '10', a<br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET could be blocks #0 to #9, #10 to #19, etc.<br>&nbsp; Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all<br>&nbsp; the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.<br><br>I don’t understand the last sentence ("Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.”) Are you trying to say that if the body size isn’t evenly divisible by MAX_PAYLOADS then the final MAX_PAYLOADS_SET will have fewer than MAX_PAYLOADS blocks in it?<br><br>(I do think this change, to introduce the term MAX_PAYLOADS_SET, is generally helpful; thanks.)</div></td>

So in that sense, “maximum” is right — it provides an upper bound on how long to wait before requesting a retransmission — but in another sense it’s wrong because the exponential increase is applied to it. I think the word “maximum” is trying to do too much work, and more words are probably required in order to make this clear. I also think the problem is exacerbated by the fact both §4.4 and §7.2 are talking normatively about how to use NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. It seems as though the main description is found in §7.2, and some confusion would be avoided by making §4.4 less specific, and simply referring forward to §7.2.<br><br>And, as noted in my DISCUSS, example 10.2.3 muddies the waters still further since it illustrates yet another behavior.<br><br><br>7. Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br>&nbsp;  after the last received payload for NON payloads before issuing a<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or<br>&nbsp;  more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing blocks with the M bit<br>&nbsp;  unset.&nbsp; The client MAY set the M bit to request this and later blocks<br>&nbsp;  from this MAX_PAYLOADS set.&nbsp; Further considerations related to the<br>&nbsp;  transmission timing for missing requests are discussed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.2.<br><br>I find this whole paragraph pretty confusing with the dueling SHOULD and MAY, where it appears the SHOULD might be doing two jobs at once. I *think* your intent is something like the following?<br><br>“The client SHOULD wait as specified in Section 7.2 for NON payloads before requesting retransmission of any missing blocks. Retransmission is requested by issuing a GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing block(s). Generally the M bit on the Q-Block option(s) SHOULD be unset, although the M bit MAY be set to request this and later blocks from this MAX_PAYLOADS set, see Section 10.2.4 for an example of this in operation.”<br><br><br>8. Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  If the size of the 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) response packet<br>&nbsp;  is larger than that defined by Section 4.6 [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>], then the number<br>&nbsp;  of missing blocks MUST be limited so that the response can fit into a<br>&nbsp;  single packet.&nbsp; If this is the case, then the server can send<br><br>Suggestion: “then the number of missing blocks reported MUST...” (The thing being limited is not the actual number of missing blocks. You’re limiting the number you report on.)<br><br><br>9. Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  It is implementation specific as to whether there should be any<br>&nbsp;  further requests for missing data as there will have been significant<br>&nbsp;  transmission failure as individual payloads will have failed after<br>&nbsp;  MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN.<br><br>This paragraph seems as though it’s a non-sequitur. It just doesn’t make sense to me. :-(<br><br><br>10. Section 7.2<br><br>(This comment relates to the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>&nbsp;  NON_TIMEOUT is the maximum period of delay between sending sets of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads for the same body.&nbsp; By default, NON_TIMEOUT has<br>&nbsp;  the same value as ACK_TIMEOUT (Section 4.8 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>Presumably the use of “maximum” means it’s fine to delay zero seconds (or any value lower than NON_TIMEOUT). <br><br><br>11. General<br><br>By the way, none of the timers specify jitter (and indeed, if read literally, jitter would be forbidden). Is this intentional?<br><br><br>12. Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the CoAP peer reports at least one payload has not arrived for<br>&nbsp;  each body for at least a 24 hour period and it is known that there<br>&nbsp;  are no other network issues over that period, then the value of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS can be reduced by 1 at a time (to a minimum of 1) and<br>&nbsp;  the situation re-evaluated for another 24 hour period until there is<br>&nbsp;  no report of missing payloads under normal operating conditions.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  newly derived value for MAX_PAYLOADS should be used for both ends of<br>&nbsp;  this particular CoAP peer link.&nbsp; Note that the CoAP peer will not<br>&nbsp;  know about the MAX_PAYLOADS change until it is reconfigured.&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  consequence of the two peers having different MAX_PAYLOADS values, a<br>&nbsp;  peer may continue indicate that there are some missing payloads as<br>&nbsp;  all of its MAX_PAYLOADS set may not have arrived.&nbsp; How the two peer<br>&nbsp;  values for MAX_PAYLOADS are synchronized is out of the scope.<br><br>I take it this is just thrown in here as an operational suggestion? It’s not specifying protocol, right? It seems a little misplaced, if so.<br><br><br>13. Section 10.1.3<br><br>(This comment relates to the aside in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t the server request 1,9,10 in one go?

You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of a message with More=0 trigger the server to request retransmission of the missing block?

You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of QB2:10/0/1024 trigger the client to request retransmission? Why does it have to wait for timeout? Similarly reception of QB2:9/1/1024 later in the example. <br><br>16. Section 10.2.4<br><br>Since MAX_PAYLOADS is 10, why does the example say “MAX_PAYLOADS has been reached” after payloads 2-9 have been retransmitted? That’s only 8 payloads.<br><br>-- <br> I do have a couple new comments raised during my review of the changes in version 12:<br><br>(<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-new-block/12/">draft-ietf-core-new-block-12</a>)<br><br>17. Section 1:<br><br>&nbsp; This document introduces the CoAP Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options which<br>&nbsp; allow block-wise transfer to work with series of Non-confirmable<br>&nbsp; messages, instead of lock-stepping using Confirmable messages<br>&nbsp; (Section 3).&nbsp; In other words, this document provides a missing piece<br>&nbsp; of [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>], namely the support of block-wise transfer using Non-<br>&nbsp; confirmable where an entire body of data can be transmitted without<br>&nbsp; the requirement for an acknowledgement (but recovery is available<br>&nbsp; should it be needed).<br><br>As far as I can tell the spec does not really remove the requirement for acknowledgement, it just amortizes the acknowledgements by only sending them every MAX_PAYLOADS_SET. Response Code 2.31 is essentially an acknowledgement, and it gets sent that frequently, right? There’s also (if I recall correctly) some flavor of acknowledgement that is sent when the entire body has been transferred. So, I think the new paragraph isn’t accurate.<br><br>This observation also applies to this claimed benefit in §3:<br><br>&nbsp; o&nbsp; They support sending an entire body using NON messages without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  requiring an intermediate response from the peer.<br><br>Response Code 2.31 is exactly an intermediate response. I guess maybe your focus is that if the intermediate response isn’t received, transmission continues, albeit more slowly than it would otherwise, and unreliably too, so in that sense the responses aren’t “required”. I think this requires awfully close parsing of the word “required”, though.<br><br>18. Section 2:<br><br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET is the set of blocks identified by block numbers<br>&nbsp; that, when divided by MAX_PAYLOADS, they have the same numeric<br><br>Remove “they” <br><br>&nbsp; result.&nbsp; For example, if MAX_PAYLOADS is set to '10', a<br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET could be blocks #0 to #9, #10 to #19, etc.<br>&nbsp; Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all<br>&nbsp; the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.<br><br>I don’t understand the last sentence ("Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.”) Are you trying to say that if the body size isn’t evenly divisible by MAX_PAYLOADS then the final MAX_PAYLOADS_SET will have fewer than MAX_PAYLOADS blocks in it?<br><br>(I do think this change, to introduce the term MAX_PAYLOADS_SET, is generally helpful; thanks.)</div></td>

However, despite a concerted effort I have not been able to nail down with confidence what the intended semantics of several of your timeouts are, notably NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. Some of the text (for example, §4.4) implies that the timeout is an upper bound on how long an implementation should wait before declaring a block to have been lost (“The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT”). At the very least, this is imprecise because the timeout increases exponentially with repeated timeouts — but this is a relatively minor matter, discussed further in my comments.<br><br>Later, in §7.2, you say that expiry of the timeout is not the only trigger for a 4.08 response:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is likely that the client will start transmitting the next set of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads before the server times out on waiting for the<br>&nbsp;  last of the previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads.&nbsp; On receipt of the first<br>&nbsp;  payload from the new set of MAX_PAYLOADS payloads, the server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  send a 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) Response Code indicating any<br>&nbsp;  missing payloads from any previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads. <br><br>It makes sense to me that you use this additional trigger. At this point in my reading of the spec, my understanding of the retransmission algorithm was that a 4.08 should be sent when either a payload is received from a new set of MAX_PAYLOADS, or NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT expires. But then I got to the example in 10.2.3, which shows the client waiting for the expiration of NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT even though it has received the first of a new set of MAX_PAYLOADS, and I concluded that either I’ve missed something basic, or the document is internally inconsistent.<br><br>As an aside, I’m also unclear as to why the only trigger you specify for sending a 4.08 is the arrival of the first of a new MAX_PAYLOADS flight. Other possible triggers I noticed include a gap in the sequence, and reception of a payload with More=0.<br><br>Some of these issues are repeated in my comments, below — I’ve noted those in the comment.

I also think the problem is exacerbated by the fact both §4.4 and §7.2 are talking normatively about how to use NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. It seems as though the main description is found in §7.2, and some confusion would be avoided by making §4.4 less specific, and simply referring forward to §7.2.<br><br>And, as noted in my DISCUSS, example 10.2.3 muddies the waters still further since it illustrates yet another behavior.<br><br><br>7. Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br>&nbsp;  after the last received payload for NON payloads before issuing a<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or<br>&nbsp;  more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing blocks with the M bit<br>&nbsp;  unset.&nbsp; The client MAY set the M bit to request this and later blocks<br>&nbsp;  from this MAX_PAYLOADS set.&nbsp; Further considerations related to the<br>&nbsp;  transmission timing for missing requests are discussed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.2.<br><br>I find this whole paragraph pretty confusing with the dueling SHOULD and MAY, where it appears the SHOULD might be doing two jobs at once. I *think* your intent is something like the following?<br><br>“The client SHOULD wait as specified in Section 7.2 for NON payloads before requesting retransmission of any missing blocks. Retransmission is requested by issuing a GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing block(s). Generally the M bit on the Q-Block option(s) SHOULD be unset, although the M bit MAY be set to request this and later blocks from this MAX_PAYLOADS set, see Section 10.2.4 for an example of this in operation.”<br><br><br>8. Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  If the size of the 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) response packet<br>&nbsp;  is larger than that defined by Section 4.6 [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>], then the number<br>&nbsp;  of missing blocks MUST be limited so that the response can fit into a<br>&nbsp;  single packet.&nbsp; If this is the case, then the server can send<br><br>Suggestion: “then the number of missing blocks reported MUST...” (The thing being limited is not the actual number of missing blocks. You’re limiting the number you report on.)<br><br><br>9. Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  It is implementation specific as to whether there should be any<br>&nbsp;  further requests for missing data as there will have been significant<br>&nbsp;  transmission failure as individual payloads will have failed after<br>&nbsp;  MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN.<br><br>This paragraph seems as though it’s a non-sequitur. It just doesn’t make sense to me. :-(<br><br><br>10. Section 7.2<br><br>(This comment relates to the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>&nbsp;  NON_TIMEOUT is the maximum period of delay between sending sets of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads for the same body.&nbsp; By default, NON_TIMEOUT has<br>&nbsp;  the same value as ACK_TIMEOUT (Section 4.8 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>Presumably the use of “maximum” means it’s fine to delay zero seconds (or any value lower than NON_TIMEOUT). <br><br><br>11. General<br><br>By the way, none of the timers specify jitter (and indeed, if read literally, jitter would be forbidden). Is this intentional?<br><br><br>12. Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the CoAP peer reports at least one payload has not arrived for<br>&nbsp;  each body for at least a 24 hour period and it is known that there<br>&nbsp;  are no other network issues over that period, then the value of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS can be reduced by 1 at a time (to a minimum of 1) and<br>&nbsp;  the situation re-evaluated for another 24 hour period until there is<br>&nbsp;  no report of missing payloads under normal operating conditions.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  newly derived value for MAX_PAYLOADS should be used for both ends of<br>&nbsp;  this particular CoAP peer link.&nbsp; Note that the CoAP peer will not<br>&nbsp;  know about the MAX_PAYLOADS change until it is reconfigured.&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  consequence of the two peers having different MAX_PAYLOADS values, a<br>&nbsp;  peer may continue indicate that there are some missing payloads as<br>&nbsp;  all of its MAX_PAYLOADS set may not have arrived.&nbsp; How the two peer<br>&nbsp;  values for MAX_PAYLOADS are synchronized is out of the scope.<br><br>I take it this is just thrown in here as an operational suggestion? It’s not specifying protocol, right? It seems a little misplaced, if so.<br><br><br>13. Section 10.1.3<br><br>(This comment relates to the aside in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t the server request 1,9,10 in one go? Since its rxmt request is triggered by rx of 11, one would think it could infer 10 had been lost. <br><br>14. Section 10.1.4 (also 10.3.3)<br><br>(This comment relates to the aside in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of a message with More=0 trigger the server to request retransmission of the missing block? Why does it have to wait for timeout?<br><br>15. Section 10.2.3<br><br>(This comment relates to my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>Why doesn’t reception of QB2:10/0/1024 trigger the client to request retransmission? Why does it have to wait for timeout? Similarly reception of QB2:9/1/1024 later in the example. <br><br>16. Section 10.2.4<br><br>Since MAX_PAYLOADS is 10, why does the example say “MAX_PAYLOADS has been reached” after payloads 2-9 have been retransmitted? That’s only 8 payloads.<br><br>-- <br><br>The comments above have been resolved or partially resolved in version 12, see <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/6geK8P9I0jZBPp9a5qSrQwQNhUo/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/core/6geK8P9I0jZBPp9a5qSrQwQNhUo/</a>. I do have a couple new comments raised during my review of the changes in version 12:<br><br>17. Section 1:<br><br>&nbsp; This document introduces the CoAP Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options which<br>&nbsp; allow block-wise transfer to work with series of Non-confirmable<br>&nbsp; messages, instead of lock-stepping using Confirmable messages<br>&nbsp; (Section 3).&nbsp; In other words, this document provides a missing piece<br>&nbsp; of [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>], namely the support of block-wise transfer using Non-<br>&nbsp; confirmable where an entire body of data can be transmitted without<br>&nbsp; the requirement for an acknowledgement (but recovery is available<br>&nbsp; should it be needed).<br><br>As far as I can tell the spec does not really remove the requirement for acknowledgement, it just amortizes the acknowledgements by only sending them every MAX_PAYLOADS_SET. Response Code 2.31 is essentially an acknowledgement, and it gets sent that frequently, right? There’s also (if I recall correctly) some flavor of acknowledgement that is sent when the entire body has been transferred. So, I think the new paragraph isn’t accurate.<br><br>This observation also applies to this claimed benefit in §3:<br><br>&nbsp; o&nbsp; They support sending an entire body using NON messages without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  requiring an intermediate response from the peer.<br><br>Response Code 2.31 is exactly an intermediate response. I guess maybe your focus is that if the intermediate response isn’t received, transmission continues, albeit more slowly than it would otherwise, and unreliably too, so in that sense the responses aren’t “required”. I think this requires awfully close parsing of the word “required”, though.<br><br>18. Section 2:<br><br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET is the set of blocks identified by block numbers<br>&nbsp; that, when divided by MAX_PAYLOADS, they have the same numeric<br><br>Remove “they” <br><br>&nbsp; result.&nbsp; For example, if MAX_PAYLOADS is set to '10', a<br>&nbsp; MAX_PAYLOADS_SET could be blocks #0 to #9, #10 to #19, etc.<br>&nbsp; Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all<br>&nbsp; the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.<br><br>I don’t understand the last sentence ("Depending on the data size, the MAX_PAYLOADS_SET may not comprise all the MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.”) Are you trying to say that if the body size isn’t evenly divisible by MAX_PAYLOADS then the final MAX_PAYLOADS_SET will have fewer than MAX_PAYLOADS blocks in it?<br><br>(I do think this change, to introduce the term MAX_PAYLOADS_SET, is generally helpful; thanks.)</div></td>

It seems that there are<br>now some merge conflicts; I cannot promise to have availability to try<br>to resolve them particularly quickly, but I can do so "eventually" if<br>needed.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a requirement for these blocks of data to be transmitted at<br>&nbsp;  higher rates under network conditions where there may be asymmetrical<br>&nbsp;  transient packet loss (i.e., responses may get dropped).&nbsp; An example<br>&nbsp;  is when a network is subject to a Distributed Denial of Service<br>&nbsp;  (DDoS) attack and there is a need for DDoS mitigation agents relying<br>&nbsp;  upon CoAP to communicate with each other (e.g.,<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC8782</a>][<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dots-telemetry/">I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry</a>]).&nbsp; As a reminder, [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>]<br><br>I suppose the RFC Editor will do the right thing about referencing 8782<br>vs 8782bis ... and I am overdue in following up on the IETF LC results<br>for the latter :(<br><br>Section 2<br><br>We currently introduce the concept of MAX_PAYLOADs by implicit use in a<br>few places before it is actually given a proper definition.&nbsp; I wonder if<br>mentioning here that it is used to group a batch of blocks would help<br>the reader.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; They support sending an entire body using Non-confirmable (NON)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages without requiring a response from the peer.<br><br>I put this change in my github PR, but repeating here for visibility<br>since I am making an assumption: I propose adding "intermediate" for<br>"without requiring an intermediate response from the peer".&nbsp; My<br>understanding is that a final message indicaing successful receiption is<br>still used (or a selective ack in case of loss), so the contrast to <a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC<br>7959</a> is in the (lack of) need for intermediate responses for each block.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Mixing of NON and CON during requests/responses using Q-Block is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not supported.<br><br>There is perhaps subtle differences across "not supported", "forbidden",<br>and "not defined in this specification".&nbsp; Do we perhaps actually mean<br>"forbidden"?<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  (DOTS) that cannot use CON responses to handle potential packet loss<br>&nbsp;  and that support application-specific mechanisms to assess whether<br>&nbsp;  the remote peer is able to handle the messages sent by a CoAP<br>&nbsp;  endpoint (e.g., DOTS heartbeats in Section 4.7 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC8782</a>]).<br><br>Can we get greater clarity on what "able to handle" is intended to mean?<br>I can't tell if it's anywhere between "the transport is able to deliver<br>message bodies" and "the software stack implements and enables a<br>particular feature".<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When the Content-Format Option is present together with the Q-Block1<br>&nbsp;  or Q-Block2 Option, the option applies to the body not to the payload<br>&nbsp;  (i.e., it must be the same for all payloads of the same body).<br><br>Do we have a normative requirement somewhere that the recipient track<br>and compare the content-format values across blocks?&nbsp; If not, should we?<br><br>&nbsp;  Q-Block2 Option is useful with GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, and<br>&nbsp;  iPATCH requests and their payload-bearing responses (2.01, 2.02,<br>&nbsp;  2.03, 2.04, and 2.05) (Section 5.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>Do we need an "e.g." in front of the list, to account for the potential<br>future registration of new payload-bearing response codes?<br><br>&nbsp;  If Q-Block1 Option is present in a request or Q-Block2 Option in a<br>&nbsp;  response (i.e., in that message to the payload of which it pertains),<br><br>Can we reword this parenthetical in a less convoluted way?&nbsp; I'm not even<br>sure I'm parsing it properly.<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).&nbsp; To reliably get a rejection message, it is therefore<br>&nbsp;  REQUIRED that clients use a Confirmable message for determining<br>&nbsp;  support for Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options.<br><br>(I know that some other discussion happened on this mechanism, but I<br>forget if there are already plans to add a clarification that this is<br>only needed once per peer within a given set of exchanges.)<br><br>&nbsp;  The Q-Block2 Option is repeatable when requesting retransmission of<br>&nbsp;  missing blocks, but not otherwise.&nbsp; Except that case, any request<br>&nbsp;  carrying multiple Q-Block1 (or Q-Block2) Options MUST be handled<br>&nbsp;  following the procedure specified in Section 5.4.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>].<br><br>Since these are critical options, the referenced procedures involve<br>rejecting the message, right?&nbsp; Is that important enough to note<br>directly?<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that if Q-Block1 or Q-Block2 Options are included in a packet as<br>&nbsp;  Inner options, Block1 or Block2 Options MUST NOT be included as Inner<br>&nbsp;  options.&nbsp; Similarly there MUST NOT be a mix of Q-Block and Block for<br>&nbsp;  the Outer options.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(Hopefully a silly question, but do we make the analogous prohibition<br>against combining Q-Block and regular Block for non-OSCORE cases<br>anywhere?&nbsp; I thought we did, but now I can't find it...)<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  being transferred.&nbsp; The Request-Tag is opaque, the server still<br>&nbsp;  treats it as opaque but the client MUST ensure that it is unique for<br>&nbsp;  every different body of transmitted data.<br><br>(nit) the structure of this sentence seems off, to me.&nbsp; I may just want<br>a comma after "server still treats it as opaque", but looking more<br>closely I might rewrite to more like "The Request-Tag is opaque to the<br>server, but the client MUST ensure that it is unique for every different<br>request body being transmitted".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation Note: It is suggested that the client treats the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Request-Tag as an unsigned integer of 8 bytes in length.&nbsp; An<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implementation may want to consider limiting this to 4 bytes to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reduce packet overhead size.&nbsp; The initial Request-Tag value should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be randomly generated and then subsequently incremented by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; client whenever a new body of data is being transmitted between<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; peers.<br><br>In the vein of <a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a>, is the<br>increment necessarily 1 or can there be gaps?&nbsp; Similarly, the risk of<br>information disclosure (via side channel) is reduced if the initial<br>random value is generated anew for each connection.&nbsp; This is maybe<br>implied by the current text but could be stated more clearly.<br><br>&nbsp;  The client MUST send the payloads with the block numbers increasing,<br>&nbsp;  starting from zero, until the body is complete (subject to any<br>&nbsp;  congestion control (Section 7)).&nbsp; Any missing payloads requested by<br>&nbsp;  the server must in addition be separately transmitted with increasing<br>&nbsp;  block numbers.<br><br>When I first read this, I thought that the block numbers of<br>retransmissions needed to continue to increase in the same sequence as<br>the original transmission, i.e., retransmitted blocks are assigned new<br>block numbers.&nbsp; The examples do not bear this out (and it seems like it<br>would be complicated to specify clearly), so I suggest rephrasing to "in<br>order of increasing block number".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the FETCH request includes the Observe Option, then the server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST use the same token as used for the initial response for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; returning any Observe triggered responses so that the client can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; match them up.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The client should then release all of the tokens used for this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; body unless a resource is being observed.<br><br>If a resource is being observed, should the client release all the other<br>tokens (than the one used for the initial response)?<br><br>Also, is the "initial response" the first response for the blockwise<br>transfer (which might be a 2.31 or 4.08 for NON requests), or the first<br>one with response code 2.05?<br><br>&nbsp;  2.31 (Continue)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Response Code can be used to indicate that all of the blocks<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; up to and including the Q-Block1 Option block NUM (all having the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; M bit set) have been successfully received.&nbsp; The token used MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be one of the tokens that were received in a request for this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; block-wise exchange.&nbsp; However, it is desirable to provide the one<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used in the last received request.<br><br>Can the client release any tokens upon receipt of such a response?<br><br>&nbsp;  4.02 (Bad Option)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Response Code MUST be returned for a Confirmable request if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the server does not support the Q-Block Options.&nbsp; Note that a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reset message must be sent in case of Non-confirmable request.<br><br>Reset only needs to be sent if the server is not ignoring the request<br>entirely, though, right?<br><br><br>%%%<br>The following few comments are interrelated:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Response Code returned with Content-Type "application/<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; missing-blocks+cbor-seq" indicates that some of the payloads are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; missing and need to be resent.&nbsp; The client then retransmits the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; missing payloads using the same Request-Tag, Size1 and Q-Block1 to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specify the block NUM, SZX, and M bit as appropriate.<br><br>The new 'M' bit is "as appropriate" for the new flight of messages, or<br>as was sent initially?&nbsp; (The examples in §10.x suggest "as was sent<br>initially".)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Request-Tag value to use is determined by taking the token in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) response, locating the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; matching client request, and then using its Request-Tag.<br><br>The "value to use" here seems to be indicating the value to use in the<br>retransmitted request...<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The token used MUST be one of the tokens that were received in a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request for this block-wise exchange.&nbsp; However, it is desirable to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provide the one used in the last received request.&nbsp; See Section 5<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for further information.<br><br>... but here the "token used" seems to be indicating the token to be<br>used in constructing the response that has response code 4.08.<br><br>If my understanding is correct, we really should have more clarity on<br>which value is "used" for which message.<br><br>Additionally, in the last quoted paragraph we refer to Section 5 for<br>further information, which includes a SHOULD-level requirement to<br>"provide the [token] used in the last received request".&nbsp; It is very<br>surprising to have the normative requirements for behavior split across<br>sections in this manner.&nbsp; (Or was the intent that Section 5 also use the<br>"desirable" wording?)<br>%%%<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The ETag is opaque, the client still treats it as opaque but the<br>&nbsp;  server MUST ensure that it is unique for every different body of<br>&nbsp;  transmitted data.<br><br>[analogous comment as for Request-Tag]<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation Note: It is suggested that the server treats the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ETag as an unsigned integer of 8 bytes in length.&nbsp; An<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implementation may want to consider limiting this to 4 bytes to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reduce packet overhead size.&nbsp; The initial ETag value should be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; randomly generated and then subsequently incremented by the server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whenever a new body of data is being transmitted between peers.<br><br>[analogous comment as for Request-Tag]<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br>&nbsp;  after the last received payload for NON payloads before issuing a<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or<br>&nbsp;  more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing blocks with the M bit<br>&nbsp;  unset.&nbsp; The client MAY set the M bit to request this and later blocks<br>&nbsp;  from this MAX_PAYLOADS set.&nbsp; Further considerations related to the<br>&nbsp;  transmission timing for missing requests are discussed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.2.<br><br>Does the MAY grant permission to send with M bit set prior to<br>NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT, or just permission to send with M bit set in<br>addition to with M bit unset (but still after the timeout)?<br><br>&nbsp;  For Confirmable responses, the client continues to acknowledge each<br>&nbsp;  packet.&nbsp; Typically, the server acknowledges the initial request using<br>&nbsp;  an ACK with the payload, and then sends the subsequent payloads as<br>&nbsp;  CON responses.&nbsp; The server will detect failure to send a packet, but<br>&nbsp;  the client can issue, after a MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN delay, a separate<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH for any missing blocks as<br>&nbsp;  needed.<br><br>Starting out with "for confirmable responses" implies that we're going<br>to separately cover non-confirmable responses later, or at some point<br>transition to statements of general applicability (to both confirmable<br>and non-confirmable responses).&nbsp; Where does that happen?<br><br>&nbsp;  A client SHOULD maintain a partial body (missing payloads) for up to<br>&nbsp;  NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2) or as defined by the Max-Age Option<br>&nbsp;  (or its default of 60 seconds (Section 5.6.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>])),<br>&nbsp;  whichever is the less.&nbsp; On release of the partial body, the client<br>&nbsp;  should then release all of the tokens used for this body unless a<br>&nbsp;  resource is being observed.<br><br>[as above, can the client release any subset of tokens in the case of<br>observe?]<br><br>&nbsp;  It is RECOMMENDED that the server maintains a cached copy of the body<br>&nbsp;  when using the Q-Block2 Option to facilitate retransmission of any<br>&nbsp;  missing payloads.<br><br>It's surprising to write that the client SHOULD but it is RECOMMENDED<br>that the server cache, when those two requirements keywords have an<br>equivalent strength per <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a>.&nbsp; Can't we used consistent terminology<br>for the same requirement level?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the server detects part way through a body transfer that the<br>&nbsp;  resource data has changed and the server is not maintaining a cached<br>&nbsp;  copy of the old data, then the transmission is terminated.&nbsp; Any<br>&nbsp;  subsequent missing block requests MUST be responded to using the<br>&nbsp;  latest ETag and Size2 Option values with the updated data.<br><br>This sounds like the server starts responding "in the middle" of the new<br>representation, so the client would need to go back and re-request the<br>initial parts, possibly across multiple groups of MAX_PAYLOADS blocks.<br>It seems like this requirement for client behavior should be more<br>clearly documented somewhere.&nbsp; We do go on to talk about the client<br>removing the stale partial body, but not about completing the new body.<br><br>Section 4.5<br><br>&nbsp;  For a response that uses Q-Block2, the Observe value MUST be the same<br>&nbsp;  for all the payloads of the same body.&nbsp; This is different from Block2<br>&nbsp;  usage where the Observe value is only present in the first block<br>&nbsp;  (Section 3.4 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>]).&nbsp; This includes payloads transmitted<br>&nbsp;  following receipt of the 'Continue' Q-Block2 Option (Section 4.4) by<br>&nbsp;  the server.&nbsp; If a missing payload is requested by a client, then both<br>&nbsp;  the request and response MUST NOT include the Observe Option.<br><br>(side note?) It seems very surprising to omit Observe from only<br>retransmitted payloads but keep it in all initial payload transmissions.<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The Size1 or Size2 option values MUST exactly represent the size of<br>&nbsp;  the data on the body so that any missing data can easily be<br>&nbsp;  determined.<br><br>Is this MUST duplicating the behavior already specified by <a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC 7959</a>?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;

 Implementation Note:&nbsp; By using 8-byte tokens, it is possible to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; easily minimize the number of tokens that have to be tracked by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clients, by keeping the bottom 32 bits the same for the same body<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the upper 32 bits containing the current body's request number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (incrementing every request, including every re-transmit).&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allows the client to be alleviated from keeping all the per-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request-state, e.g., in Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8974/">RFC8974</a>].<br><br>If we're going to introduce structure into a nominally opaque<br>identifier, we need to discuss the consequences of that in the security<br>considerations.&nbsp;

However, despite a concerted effort I have not been able to nail down with confidence what the intended semantics of several of your timeouts are, notably NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. Some of the text (for example, §4.4) implies that the timeout is an upper bound on how long an implementation should wait before declaring a block to have been lost (“The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT”). At the very least, this is imprecise because the timeout increases exponentially with repeated timeouts — but this is a relatively minor matter, discussed further in my comments.<br><br>Later, in §7.2, you say that expiry of the timeout is not the only trigger for a 4.08 response:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is likely that the client will start transmitting the next set of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads before the server times out on waiting for the<br>&nbsp;  last of the previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads.&nbsp; On receipt of the first<br>&nbsp;  payload from the new set of MAX_PAYLOADS payloads, the server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  send a 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) Response Code indicating any<br>&nbsp;  missing payloads from any previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads. <br><br>It makes sense to me that you use this additional trigger. At this point in my reading of the spec, my understanding of the retransmission algorithm was that a 4.08 should be sent when either a payload is received from a new set of MAX_PAYLOADS, or NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT expires. But then I got to the example in 10.2.3, which shows the client waiting for the expiration of NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT even though it has received the first of a new set of MAX_PAYLOADS, and I concluded that either I’ve missed something basic, or the document is internally inconsistent.<br><br>As an aside, I’m also unclear as to why the only trigger you specify for sending a 4.08 is the arrival of the first of a new MAX_PAYLOADS flight. Other possible triggers I noticed include a gap in the sequence, and reception of a payload with More=0.<br><br>Some of these issues are repeated in my comments, below — I’ve noted those in the comment.

Or does it have other deficiencies that also make it unsuitable?<br><br><br>2. Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Q-Block2 Option is useful with GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, and<br>&nbsp;  iPATCH requests and their payload-bearing responses (2.01, 2.02,<br>&nbsp;  2.03, 2.04, and 2.05) (Section 5.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>]).<br><br>I found the list of codes incomprehensible on first encountering it, since the concept of response codes hadn’t been introduced yet. I do understand that the document assumes familiarity with CoAP; nonetheless for basic clarity I think this should say “(response codes 2.01, 2.02…”. Additionally, the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> §5.5 doesn’t seem to be especially germane?<br><br>By the way, is 2.03 indeed a payload-bearing response? The only other place the spec touches on it is in §4.4, which says “the server could respond with a 2.03 (Valid) response with no payload”.<br><br><br>3. Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To indicate support for Q-Block2 responses, the CoAP client MUST<br>&nbsp;  include the Q-Block2 Option in a GET or similar request (FETCH, for<br>&nbsp;  example), the Q-Block2 Option in a PUT or similar request, or the<br>&nbsp;  Q-Block1 Option in a PUT or similar request so that the server knows<br>&nbsp;  that the client supports this Q-Block functionality should it need to<br>&nbsp;  send back a body that spans multiple payloads.&nbsp; Otherwise, the server<br>&nbsp;  would use the Block2 Option (if supported) to send back a message<br>&nbsp;  body that is too large to fit into a single IP packet [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>].<br><br>Is this paragraph really supposed to mention both Q-Block2 and Q-Block1?

Section 4.4 (also two places in §4.3)<br><br>(This comment rehashes, in more detail, the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS. You may want to skip over it until we’ve resolved the DISCUSS, after which this may, or may not, be relevant.)<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br><br>I read this as meaning the client should wait for as little as zero, or as long as NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT — that’s my understanding of “up to”. Is that the intended meaning? If it is, I think it’s worth writing out as I’ve done, for clarity. If it’s not, it definitely needs to be fixed. <br><br>There’s a similar issue with “up to NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT” later in the section. <br><br>Referring ahead to Section 7.2 muddies the waters further. Even though the text quoted above says NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT is an upper limit on how long to wait, §7.2 says it’s a lower limit instead... maybe? From §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT is the initial maximum time to wait for a missing<br><br>“Maximum”, ok great, that means “upper bound” and so lines up with §4.4 although the “initial” is surprising since §4.4 doesn’t say anything about the upper limit increasing. It continues:<br><br>&nbsp;  payload before requesting retransmission for the first time.&nbsp; Every<br>&nbsp;  time the missing payload is re-requested, the time to wait value<br>&nbsp;  doubles.&nbsp; The time to wait is calculated as:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time-to-Wait = NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT * (2 ** (Re-Request-Count - 1))<br><br>But this part says it’s (a) an exact time-to-wait, not a “maximum”, and (b) it says it increases exponentially, so NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT isn’t a maximum at all, but a minimum. <br><br>This later text in §7.2 implies that perhaps the problem in the above passages is the word “maximum”, and it should simply be deleted:<br><br>&nbsp;  For the server receiving NON Q-Block1 requests, it SHOULD send back a<br>&nbsp;  2.31 (Continue) Response Code on receipt of all of the MAX_PAYLOADS<br>&nbsp;  payloads to prevent the client unnecessarily delaying.&nbsp; If not all of<br>&nbsp;  the MAX_PAYLOADS payloads were received, the server SHOULD delay for<br>&nbsp;  NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (exponentially scaled based on the repeat request<br>&nbsp;  count for a payload) before sending the 4.08 (Request Entity<br>&nbsp;  Incomplete) Response Code for the missing payload(s).&nbsp; <br><br>Similarly “up to” in the quote that began this comment should be “at least”. <br><br>Whether you adopt those suggestions or not,&nbsp; it seems as though all this needs to be rewritten with careful attention to conveying what the desired behavior is. <br><br>But the plot thickens. Later in §7.2 we have<br><br>&nbsp;  It is likely that the client will start transmitting the next set of<br>&nbsp;  MAX_PAYLOADS payloads before the server times out on waiting for the<br>&nbsp;  last of the previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads.&nbsp; On receipt of the first<br>&nbsp;  payload from the new set of MAX_PAYLOADS payloads, the server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  send a 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) Response Code indicating any<br>&nbsp;  missing payloads from any previous MAX_PAYLOADS payloads. <br><br>The point being that the retransmission request can be triggered by an event other than timer expiration. So in that sense, “maximum” is right — it provides an upper bound on how long to wait before requesting a retransmission — but in another sense it’s wrong because the exponential increase is applied to it. I think the word “maximum” is trying to do too much work, and more words are probably required in order to make this clear. I also think the problem is exacerbated by the fact both §4.4 and §7.2 are talking normatively about how to use NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT. It seems as though the main description is found in §7.2, and some confusion would be avoided by making §4.4 less specific, and simply referring forward to §7.2.<br><br>And, as noted in my DISCUSS, example 10.2.3 muddies the waters still further since it illustrates yet another behavior.<br><br><br>7. Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD wait for up to NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT (Section 7.2)<br>&nbsp;  after the last received payload for NON payloads before issuing a<br>&nbsp;  GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or<br>&nbsp;  more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing blocks with the M bit<br>&nbsp;  unset.&nbsp; The client MAY set the M bit to request this and later blocks<br>&nbsp;  from this MAX_PAYLOADS set.&nbsp; Further considerations related to the<br>&nbsp;  transmission timing for missing requests are discussed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.2.<br><br>I find this whole paragraph pretty confusing with the dueling SHOULD and MAY, where it appears the SHOULD might be doing two jobs at once. I *think* your intent is something like the following?<br><br>“The client SHOULD wait as specified in Section 7.2 for NON payloads before requesting retransmission of any missing blocks. Retransmission is requested by issuing a GET, POST, PUT, FETCH, PATCH, or iPATCH request that contains one or more Q-Block2 Options that define the missing block(s). Generally the M bit on the Q-Block option(s) SHOULD be unset, although the M bit MAY be set to request this and later blocks from this MAX_PAYLOADS set, see Section 10.2.4 for an example of this in operation.”<br><br><br>8. Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  If the size of the 4.08 (Request Entity Incomplete) response packet<br>&nbsp;  is larger than that defined by Section 4.6 [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>], then the number<br>&nbsp;  of missing blocks MUST be limited so that the response can fit into a<br>&nbsp;  single packet.&nbsp; If this is the case, then the server can send<br><br>Suggestion: “then the number of missing blocks reported MUST...” (The thing being limited is not the actual number of missing blocks. You’re limiting the number you report on.)<br><br><br>9. Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  It is implementation specific as to whether there should be any<br>&nbsp;  further requests for missing data as there will have been significant<br>&nbsp;  transmission failure as individual payloads will have failed after<br>&nbsp;  MAX_TRANSMIT_SPAN.<br><br>This paragraph seems as though it’s a non-sequitur. It just doesn’t make sense to me. :-(<br><br><br>10. Section 7.2<br><br>(This comment relates to the difficulty explained in my DISCUSS.

Reading front-to-back, I spent most of Section 4 confused.<br><br>- (4.4) It would be useful to state that clients MUST (SHOULD?) NOT request retransmission of blocks from ETags that are not "fresh" -- IIUC, they probably don't exist anymore, and anyway the server has no way of knowing which non-fresh ETag to serve beacuse it says "The ETag Option should not be used in the request for missing blocks"<br><br>BTW, s/should/SHOULD<br><br>- (7.2) If NON_PROBING_WAIT and NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT both "have the same value as computed for EXCHANGE_LIFETIME", why are they different variables?

The two options enable effective block-wise transfers of large data payload, also under network conditions where asymmetrical transient packet loss may be experienced.<br><br>The main use case addressed by this document is a network under Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where DDoS mitigation agents are still required to exchange large amount of data using CoAP. This use case is especially targeted in the DOTS Working Group, where the use of the two new options is suggested in its DOTS Telemetry, see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dots-telemetry/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dots-telemetry/</a><br><br>Compared to the similar options Block1 and Block2 defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC 7959</a> --- which are based on synchronous, lock-step exchanges of blocks, and thus can be ineffective or even prohibitive to use under a DDoS situation --- the new options enable faster transmission rates with less packet interchanges, as well as faster recovery of lost blocks.<br><br>The document also defines congestion control procedures to be used when the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options are used over an unreliable transport.<br><br>The document is intended for Standards Track.<br><br>Version -11 addressed Last Call comments from GenART about providing clarifications and small fixes.<br><br>### Review and Consensus<br><br>The document has been discussed on multiple IETF meetings and CoRE interim meetings, and has gone through multiple expert reviews.<br><br>During and after Working Group Last Call, effort was also put in better reflecting how design choices align with the intended scope of the document, i.e. to serve especially use cases with asymmetrical transient packet loss and particularly the DOTS Telemetry, see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8782">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8782</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dots-telemetry/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dots-telemetry/</a><br><br>Consensus has been reached on the scope, content and level of detail of the document.<br><br>### Intellectual Property<br><br>Each author has stated that they do not have direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document.
