He surely<br>reminded me enough times to do it before it landed at the IESG.<br><br><br>This is a very well written document. Thanks to everyone involved. While I have a few DISCUSS<br>comments, these should be easy to address or convince me why no changes are required.<br><br>Note to self (and Valery): <a href="/doc/draft-kampati-ipsecme-ikev2-sa-ts-payloads-opt/">draft-kampati-ipsecme-ikev2-sa-ts-payloads-opt</a> needs to be updated<br>to support this document. It currently only supports sending one KE payload.<br><br>## OLD DISCUSSes resolved<br><br><br>### IANA entries mentions in the Introduction ?<br><br>Shouldn't the introduction mention this draft introduces the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE Exchange<br>and the STATE_NOT_FOUND Notify Message Type, along with additional entries to the<br>(now renamed) Key Exchanges Methods registry?<br><br>### Additional key exchanges DoS ?<br><br>The following paragraph raised an issue for me:<br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the responder selects NONE for some Additional Key Exchange types<br>&nbsp;  (provided they are proposed by the initiator), then the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>If the initiator's local policy requires at least one Additional Key Exchange,<br>an attacker sending back a quick reply with only NONE replies would be a DoS.<br>I think similar to like the original IKE_SA_INIT, perhaps we need to give some<br>advise that if the local policy would lead to permanent failure, that it<br>should wait for other (more legitimate) responses to this IKE_SA_INIT ?<br><br>### ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE<br>```<br>&nbsp;  After IKE SA is created the window size may be greater than one and<br>&nbsp;  multiple concurrent exchanges may be in progress, it is essential to<br>&nbsp;  link the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges together<br>```<br>I had some trouble figuring out why these are needed. For Child SA rekeys, these<br>would not be needed, because we would have an old SPI and MSGID that would make the<br>order obvious. But for adding addtional Child SA's, we have no old SPI. But we have<br>a new SPI on the initiator (and then a new SPI on the responder in the answer. Since<br>these are coupled by MSGID, I wonder if ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE is really needed?<br>Looking at the useful appendix examples, I realise that the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchange<br>does not have an SA payload so no SPI, so it makes sense to me now. Perhaps a sentence<br>in the document would be useful to explain this?<br><br>I still do not know why not to use the SPI as value for ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE instead<br>of an opaque linking blob? The SPI is traditionally our linking blob.<br><br>Could the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE set the SPI value in the IKE header instead of using<br>a new ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE payload and use that with the MSGID as linking blob?<br><br><br>### State loss issue<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  After receiving this notification the initiator MAY start<br>&nbsp;  a new CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange which may eventually be followed by<br>&nbsp;  the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges, to retry the failed attempt.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  initiator continues to receive STATE_NOT_FOUND notifications [...]<br>```<br>How could this happen? If the state was lost, eg due to reboot, there would<br>need to come a new IKE SA, that can then send a new CREATE_CHILD_SA. I don't<br>see how that could lead to another STATE_NOT_FOUND. But the paragraph then<br>also continues with "and delete [the] IKE SA". But this IKE SA is brand new? <br>I would just remove this entire paragraph as I think this cannot happen. Or<br>at least it is not a special case and existing abort code handles this already.<br><br>### IKE session resumption<br><br>Should there be a section updating <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a> Section 5.1, or is the method there<br>specified quantum-safe if the initial IKE SA was protected using this document's<br>mechanism? See <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5723.html#section-5.1">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5723.html#section-5.1</a><br><br>I think the IKE resumption can work "as normal", as no KE payload is<br>involved in the resumption, but it would be nice if a sentence somewhere<br>in this document could confirm this. <br><br>Also <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a> states:<br>```<br>The keys and cryptographic protection algorithms should be at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; least 128 bits in strength.<br>```<br>IF we live in Grover universe, perhaps that should be 256 bits in strength? And since<br>we are making things quantum safe with this document, perhaps we should then at least<br>state session tickets should be 256 bits. Note if we do, then this document must<br>Update: <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a>. Perhaps this note on 5723 can be added in the Security Considerations<br>Section paragraph that talks about Grover and Shor.<br><br>### non-fatal NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN?<br>```<br>&nbsp;  In this case, the responder may respond with<br>&nbsp;  non-fatal error such as NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN notify message type.<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Technically, this error is non-fatal. But in this context, wouldn't it be fatal if the<br>responder insists on additional exchanges during the initial exchange and the initiator<br>doesn't suppor this? It is sort of a lame duck IKE SA ? :)<br><br>Also the "may" responder is unclear to me. What other response could there be and why?<br><br>### misplaced text?<br>```<br>&nbsp;  Note that if the initial IKE SA is used to transfer sensitive<br>&nbsp;  information, then this information will not be protected using the<br>&nbsp;  additional key exchanges [...]<br>```<br>This paragraph appears in the Section "Interaction with Childless IKE SA", but should probably<br>be moved to the Security Considerations section.<br><br>### IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE name<br><br>I find the name IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE a little confusing, as this exchange applies to<br>IKE and IPsec SA rekey negotiations. Why is it not called FOLLOWUP_ADDITIONAL_KE ?<br>Or CREATE_CHILD_SA_FOLLOWUP(_KE) (a sort of bad name too but that at least follows the<br>bad name from the original IKEv2 spec)<br><br><br>### authentication ?<br><br>``` <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not address authentication since it is less urgent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at this stage.<br>```<br>While true, it does state that PPKs can be used. It might also want to say that<br>no IKE protocol level changes would be needed for authentication. A new <a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC 7427</a><br>Digital Signature algorithm that is quantum-safe could be defined for X.509 and would<br>become available immediately without any IKEv2 level changes. So in a way, this<br>issue will be addressed but no IKEv2 document is needed for that. Perhaps this<br>can be clarified in the draft?<br><br>Related to this is text in the Security Considerations:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  In particular, the authenticity of the SAs established<br>&nbsp;  under IKEv2 is protected using a pre-shared key, RSA, DSA, or ECDSA<br>&nbsp;  algorithms.<br>``` <br>This text is also incorrect as <a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC 7427</a> allows us to use post-quantum authentication<br>algorithms that have a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) definition. There might not be any<br>now, but there will presumbly be some in the future.<br><br>### AH<br><br>Section 4 lists AH. Is there much point in using this document when deploying AH?<br>The idea was the protect against _future_ quantum computers breaking encryption,<br>not MITM style packet modification. So using AH (or ESP_NULL) with this document<br>seems pointless :)<br><br>And the Security Considerations kind of agree with me here:<br>```<br>&nbsp;  Until quantum computers<br>&nbsp;  become available there is no point in attacking the authenticity of a<br>&nbsp;  connection because there are no possibilities for exploitation.<br>```<br><br>## Comments<br><br><br><br>### Section 2<br><br>I would probably have moved the Design Criteria to a later Section or Appendix, after<br>the entire protocol specification and Security Considerations. It's nice to know the<br>background, but this is "optional information" and shouldn't be as much at the focus<br>at the start of the document. (this is comment, you are fine to disagree and leave it<br>where it is)<br><br>### should -&gt; could<br>```<br>&nbsp;  However, if such a requirement is<br>&nbsp;  needed, [<a href="/doc/draft-tjhai-ikev2-beyond-64k-limit/">I-D.tjhai-ikev2-beyond-64k-limit</a>] discusses approaches that<br>&nbsp;  should be taken to exchange huge payloads.<br>```<br>I think this should should be a could, because it is a draft and it isn't<br>even adopted yet. I don't think that is suitable for a "should" even in lowercase.<br><br>### Design Criterea<br><br>One design criteria I do not see mentioned is "limit the extra number of RTTs as<br>much as possible". I do believe that was an important design criterea ?<br><br>The "future proof" design criterea is probably better named as "not post-quantum specific" ?<br><br>### Section 3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  A hybrid solution, when multiple<br>&nbsp;  key exchanges are performed and the calculated shared key depends on<br>&nbsp;  all of them, allows us to deal with this uncertainty by combining a<br>&nbsp;  classical key exchange with a post-quantum one, as well as leaving<br>&nbsp;  open the possibility of multiple post-quantum key exchanges.<br>```<br><br>This is an excellent summary sentence. It would be great to actually have this one in the<br>introduction :)<br><br>### IKE_INTERMEDIATE "is encrypted"<br>```<br>&nbsp;  The additional key exchanges are performed using<br>&nbsp;  IKE_INTERMEDIATE messages; because these messages are encrypted, the<br>&nbsp;  standard IKE fragmentation mechanism is available.<br>```<br>I think this is confusing. It is not really "because" they are encrypted that the fragmentation<br>mechanism "is available". Additionally, "encrypted" probably should clarify the level of<br>encryption - eg it would not me post-quantum safe. And of course it does not need to be.<br>Mabye something like:<br><br>&nbsp;  The additional key exchanges are performed using IKE_INTERMEDIATE messages that follow the<br>&nbsp;  IKE_SA_INIT exchange. This is to allow for standard IKE fragmentation mechanisms to be<br>&nbsp;  available for the potentially large post-quantum Key Exchange algorithm payloads. The IKE_SA_INIT<br>&nbsp;  exchange does not [cannot?] support fragmentation.<br><br>###<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that hybrid key exchange is not needed.<br>```<br>Maybe:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that a hybrid key exchange containing a classic (EC)DH is no longer needed.<br><br>### Section 3.1 Childless?<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Following that, the IKE_AUTH exchange authenticates peers<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and completes IKE SA establishment.<br>```<br>This made me wonder if it was required to do a Childless IKE SA. I think a clarification is in order<br>here. Perhaps:<br><br>Following that, the IKE_AUTH exchange comples at normal and authenticates the peers, completes<br>the IKE SA establishment and when not childless, a Child SA is also established.<br><br><br>### Section 3.1 ASCII art<br><br>Probably, it should be clarified here that {} means "encrypted", or point a sentence on syntax to the<br>explanation in <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a>? While this is obvious to readers of IKEv2 documents, this document has not<br>actually stated that this is the meaning. Additionally, perhaps introduce a {{foo}} that means<br>encrypted safely for classic and quantum ?<br><br>### duplicated algorithms<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT contain duplicated algorithms<br>```<br>But it goes on saying this _can_ be possible, if the algorithm properties are the same, so this<br>sentence needs to reflect that to avoid misimplementation. Maybe:<br><br>MUST NOT contain duplicated algorithms with identical attributes<br><br>### Section 3.2.1.&nbsp; MUST stop SA<br>```<br>&nbsp;  the initiator should log the<br>&nbsp;  error and MUST stop creating the SA or delete the SA if it is a<br>&nbsp;  rekey.<br>```<br><br>There is ambiguity here on the "delete the SA if it is a rekey". I think you mean to say to<br>stop creating or delete the SA being negotiated, and not to delete the SA that was attempted<br>to be rekeyed. How about the simpler:<br><br>the initiator should log the error and MUST abort the exchange with a permanent error.<br><br>### Section 3.2.1 IKE_INTERMEDIATE<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; then the corresponding IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>```<br>You are already then clarifying this statement, but perhaps to avoid misimplementing, rewrite this to:<br><br>then the corresponding Additional Key Exchange(s) in the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>If there is no Additional Key Exchange left to negotiate, this could mean that there is no more need<br>to perform any IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges.<br>[and remove the following paragraph completely]<br><br>### Section 3.2.2<br>```<br>&nbsp;  The other keying materials SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei,<br>&nbsp;  SK_er, SK_pi, SK_pr are updated as:<br><br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>```<br>Why not say: The other keying materials SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er, SK_pi, SK_pr are generated<br>from the SKEYSEED(n) as per <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC 7296</a>.<br><br>### Section 3.2.3<br>```<br>&nbsp;  This exchange is the<br>&nbsp;  standard IKE exchange, except that the initiator and responder signed<br>&nbsp;  octets are modified as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc9242/">RFC9242</a>].<br>```<br>Instead of "modified", which might mislead the reader into thinking this documents "modifies" that<br>process, I would say:<br><br>This exchange is the standard IKE exchange as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc9242/">RFC9242</a>].<br><br>### Section 3.2.4 missed rename<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the peers may optionally perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange<br>```<br>Should this not also be renamed into: perform an additional Key Exchange Method<br><br>### Section 3.2.4 Simultanious rekey<br>```<br>&nbsp;  the initiator of this exchange just stops the<br>&nbsp;  rekeying process and it MUST NOT initiate the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE<br>&nbsp;  exchange.<br>```<br>should this clarify with: and MUST delete the state and MUST NOT send a Delete/notify&nbsp; ?<br><br>### Section 3.2.5 Childless IKE SA<br><br>This section explains how to use establish Child SAs without using the<br>IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange.<br><br>I guess I would prefer that there are not two ways to do something, as IKEv2 is<br>already complex enough. But I guess the infrastructure needed for rekeying causes<br>this additional method to creep in whether we want it or not.<br><br>### I did?<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to Paul Wouters for reviewing the document.<br>```<br>I have no memory of this. Or was this pro-actively added? More serious, I guess I did<br>review this a long long time ago when the document looked very different :)<br><br>### Example is a bit contrived :)<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = PQ_KEM_1)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = PQ_KEM_2)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = NONE)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = PQ_KEM_3)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = PQ_KEM_4)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = NONE)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = PQ_KEM_5)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = PQ_KEM_6)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = NONE)<br>```<br>I understand this is just an example to show the processing, but it would be a little odd<br>that both the order of (1|2) before (3|4) before (5|6) would matter if these sets are all<br>themselves optional - they are "optional requirements" ? :)<br><br>### Sending post-quantum proposals and policies in KE payload only<br><br>This solution was rejected because of a downgrade attack. Note though, that a new notify<br>payload of 'I_TRIED_POST_QUANTUM_FIRST' could be sent and the attacker would have been caught<br>in IKE_AUTH by the responder seeing this notify but never having seen the PQ KE payloads.<br>(not saying we should abandon this doc and go back to this proposal :)<br><br><br>### NITS<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; needs to be integrated into IPsec protocol<br>```<br><br>should be "into the IPsec protocol"<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, there does not exist a post-quantum key<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exchange that is trusted at the level that (EC)DH is trusted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; against conventional (non-quantum) adversaries.&nbsp; A hybrid post-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quantum algorithm to be introduced next to well-established<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; primitives, since the overall security is at least as strong as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each individual primitive.<br>```<br><br>I found this hard to read.

It currently only supports sending one KE payload.<br><br>## DISCUSS<br><br><br>### IANA entries mentions in the Introduction ?<br><br>Shouldn't the introduction mention this draft introduces the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE Exchange<br>and the STATE_NOT_FOUND Notify Message Type, along with additional entries to the<br>(now renamed) Key Exchanges Methods registry?<br><br>### Additional key exchanges DoS ?<br><br>The following paragraph raised an issue for me:<br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the responder selects NONE for some Additional Key Exchange types<br>&nbsp;  (provided they are proposed by the initiator), then the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>If the initiator's local policy requires at least one Additional Key Exchange,<br>an attacker sending back a quick reply with only NONE replies would be a DoS.<br>I think similar to like the original IKE_SA_INIT, perhaps we need to give some<br>advise that if the local policy would lead to permanent failure, that it<br>should wait for other (more legitimate) responses to this IKE_SA_INIT ?<br><br>### ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE<br>```<br>&nbsp;  After IKE SA is created the window size may be greater than one and<br>&nbsp;  multiple concurrent exchanges may be in progress, it is essential to<br>&nbsp;  link the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges together<br>```<br>I had some trouble figuring out why these are needed. For Child SA rekeys, these<br>would not be needed, because we would have an old SPI and MSGID that would make the<br>order obvious. But for adding addtional Child SA's, we have no old SPI. But we have<br>a new SPI on the initiator (and then a new SPI on the responder in the answer. Since<br>these are coupled by MSGID, I wonder if ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE is really needed?<br>Looking at the useful appendix examples, I realise that the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchange<br>does not have an SA payload so no SPI, so it makes sense to me now. Perhaps a sentence<br>in the document would be useful to explain this?<br><br>I still do not know why not to use the SPI as value for ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE instead<br>of an opaque linking blob? The SPI is traditionally our linking blob.<br><br>Could the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE set the SPI value in the IKE header instead of using<br>a new ADDITIONAL_KEY_EXCHANGE payload and use that with the MSGID as linking blob?<br><br><br>### State loss issue<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  After receiving this notification the initiator MAY start<br>&nbsp;  a new CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange which may eventually be followed by<br>&nbsp;  the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges, to retry the failed attempt.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  initiator continues to receive STATE_NOT_FOUND notifications [...]<br>```<br>How could this happen? If the state was lost, eg due to reboot, there would<br>need to come a new IKE SA, that can then send a new CREATE_CHILD_SA. I don't<br>see how that could lead to another STATE_NOT_FOUND. But the paragraph then<br>also continues with "and delete [the] IKE SA". But this IKE SA is brand new? <br>I would just remove this entire paragraph as I think this cannot happen. Or<br>at least it is not a special case and existing abort code handles this already.<br><br>### IKE session resumption<br><br>Should there be a section updating <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a> Section 5.1, or is the method there<br>specified quantum-safe if the initial IKE SA was protected using this document's<br>mechanism? See <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5723.html#section-5.1">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5723.html#section-5.1</a><br><br>I think the IKE resumption can work "as normal", as no KE payload is<br>involved in the resumption, but it would be nice if a sentence somewhere<br>in this document could confirm this. <br><br>Also <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a> states:<br>```<br>The keys and cryptographic protection algorithms should be at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; least 128 bits in strength.<br>```<br>IF we live in Grover universe, perhaps that should be 256 bits in strength? And since<br>we are making things quantum safe with this document, perhaps we should then at least<br>state session tickets should be 256 bits. Note if we do, then this document must<br>Update: <a href="/doc/rfc5723/">RFC 5723</a>. Perhaps this note on 5723 can be added in the Security Considerations<br>Section paragraph that talks about Grover and Shor.<br><br>### non-fatal NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN?<br>```<br>&nbsp;  In this case, the responder may respond with<br>&nbsp;  non-fatal error such as NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN notify message type.<br>```&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Technically, this error is non-fatal. But in this context, wouldn't it be fatal if the<br>responder insists on additional exchanges during the initial exchange and the initiator<br>doesn't suppor this? It is sort of a lame duck IKE SA ? :)<br><br>Also the "may" responder is unclear to me. What other response could there be and why?<br><br>### misplaced text?<br>```<br>&nbsp;  Note that if the initial IKE SA is used to transfer sensitive<br>&nbsp;  information, then this information will not be protected using the<br>&nbsp;  additional key exchanges [...]<br>```<br>This paragraph appears in the Section "Interaction with Childless IKE SA", but should probably<br>be moved to the Security Considerations section.<br><br>### IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE name<br><br>I find the name IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE a little confusing, as this exchange applies to<br>IKE and IPsec SA rekey negotiations. Why is it not called FOLLOWUP_ADDITIONAL_KE ?<br>Or CREATE_CHILD_SA_FOLLOWUP(_KE) (a sort of bad name too but that at least follows the<br>bad name from the original IKEv2 spec)<br><br><br>### authentication ?<br><br>``` <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not address authentication since it is less urgent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at this stage.<br>```<br>While true, it does state that PPKs can be used. It might also want to say that<br>no IKE protocol level changes would be needed for authentication. A new <a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC 7427</a><br>Digital Signature algorithm that is quantum-safe could be defined for X.509 and would<br>become available immediately without any IKEv2 level changes. So in a way, this<br>issue will be addressed but no IKEv2 document is needed for that. Perhaps this<br>can be clarified in the draft?<br><br>Related to this is text in the Security Considerations:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  In particular, the authenticity of the SAs established<br>&nbsp;  under IKEv2 is protected using a pre-shared key, RSA, DSA, or ECDSA<br>&nbsp;  algorithms.<br>``` <br>This text is also incorrect as <a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC 7427</a> allows us to use post-quantum authentication<br>algorithms that have a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (SPKI) definition. There might not be any<br>now, but there will presumbly be some in the future.<br><br>### AH<br><br>Section 4 lists AH. Is there much point in using this document when deploying AH?<br>The idea was the protect against _future_ quantum computers breaking encryption,<br>not MITM style packet modification. So using AH (or ESP_NULL) with this document<br>seems pointless :)<br><br>And the Security Considerations kind of agree with me here:<br>```<br>&nbsp;  Until quantum computers<br>&nbsp;  become available there is no point in attacking the authenticity of a<br>&nbsp;  connection because there are no possibilities for exploitation.<br>```</div></td>

I don't think that is suitable for a "should" even in lowercase.<br><br>### Design Criterea<br><br>One design criteria I do not see mentioned is "limit the extra number of RTTs as<br>much as possible". I do believe that was an important design criterea ?<br><br>The "future proof" design criterea is probably better named as "not post-quantum specific" ?<br><br>### Section 3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  A hybrid solution, when multiple<br>&nbsp;  key exchanges are performed and the calculated shared key depends on<br>&nbsp;  all of them, allows us to deal with this uncertainty by combining a<br>&nbsp;  classical key exchange with a post-quantum one, as well as leaving<br>&nbsp;  open the possibility of multiple post-quantum key exchanges.<br>```<br><br>This is an excellent summary sentence. It would be great to actually have this one in the<br>introduction :)<br><br>### IKE_INTERMEDIATE "is encrypted"<br>```<br>&nbsp;  The additional key exchanges are performed using<br>&nbsp;  IKE_INTERMEDIATE messages; because these messages are encrypted, the<br>&nbsp;  standard IKE fragmentation mechanism is available.<br>```<br>I think this is confusing. It is not really "because" they are encrypted that the fragmentation<br>mechanism "is available". Additionally, "encrypted" probably should clarify the level of<br>encryption - eg it would not me post-quantum safe. And of course it does not need to be.<br>Mabye something like:<br><br>&nbsp;  The additional key exchanges are performed using IKE_INTERMEDIATE messages that follow the<br>&nbsp;  IKE_SA_INIT exchange. This is to allow for standard IKE fragmentation mechanisms to be<br>&nbsp;  available for the potentially large post-quantum Key Exchange algorithm payloads. The IKE_SA_INIT<br>&nbsp;  exchange does not [cannot?] support fragmentation.<br><br>###<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that hybrid key exchange is not needed.<br>```<br>Maybe:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and that a hybrid key exchange containing a classic (EC)DH is no longer needed.<br><br>### Section 3.1 Childless?<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Following that, the IKE_AUTH exchange authenticates peers<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and completes IKE SA establishment.<br>```<br>This made me wonder if it was required to do a Childless IKE SA. I think a clarification is in order<br>here. Perhaps:<br><br>Following that, the IKE_AUTH exchange comples at normal and authenticates the peers, completes<br>the IKE SA establishment and when not childless, a Child SA is also established.<br><br><br>### Section 3.1 ASCII art<br><br>Probably, it should be clarified here that {} means "encrypted", or point a sentence on syntax to the<br>explanation in <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a>? While this is obvious to readers of IKEv2 documents, this document has not<br>actually stated that this is the meaning. Additionally, perhaps introduce a {{foo}} that means<br>encrypted safely for classic and quantum ?<br><br>### duplicated algorithms<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT contain duplicated algorithms<br>```<br>But it goes on saying this _can_ be possible, if the algorithm properties are the same, so this<br>sentence needs to reflect that to avoid misimplementation. Maybe:<br><br>MUST NOT contain duplicated algorithms with identical attributes<br><br>### Section 3.2.1.&nbsp; MUST stop SA<br>```<br>&nbsp;  the initiator should log the<br>&nbsp;  error and MUST stop creating the SA or delete the SA if it is a<br>&nbsp;  rekey.<br>```<br><br>There is ambiguity here on the "delete the SA if it is a rekey". I think you mean to say to<br>stop creating or delete the SA being negotiated, and not to delete the SA that was attempted<br>to be rekeyed. How about the simpler:<br><br>the initiator should log the error and MUST abort the exchange with a permanent error.<br><br>### Section 3.2.1 IKE_INTERMEDIATE<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; then the corresponding IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>```<br>You are already then clarifying this statement, but perhaps to avoid misimplementing, rewrite this to:<br><br>then the corresponding Additional Key Exchange(s) in the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges MUST NOT take place.<br>If there is no Additional Key Exchange left to negotiate, this could mean that there is no more need<br>to perform any IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges.<br>[and remove the following paragraph completely]<br><br>### Section 3.2.2<br>```<br>&nbsp;  The other keying materials SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei,<br>&nbsp;  SK_er, SK_pi, SK_pr are updated as:<br><br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>```<br>Why not say: The other keying materials SK_d, SK_ai, SK_ar, SK_ei, SK_er, SK_pi, SK_pr are generated<br>from the SKEYSEED(n) as per <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC 7296</a>.<br><br>### Section 3.2.3<br>```<br>&nbsp;  This exchange is the<br>&nbsp;  standard IKE exchange, except that the initiator and responder signed<br>&nbsp;  octets are modified as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc9242/">RFC9242</a>].<br>```<br>Instead of "modified", which might mislead the reader into thinking this documents "modifies" that<br>process, I would say:<br><br>This exchange is the standard IKE exchange as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc9242/">RFC9242</a>].<br><br>### Section 3.2.4 missed rename<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the peers may optionally perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange<br>```<br>Should this not also be renamed into: perform an additional Key Exchange Method<br><br>### Section 3.2.4 Simultanious rekey<br>```<br>&nbsp;  the initiator of this exchange just stops the<br>&nbsp;  rekeying process and it MUST NOT initiate the IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE<br>&nbsp;  exchange.<br>```<br>should this clarify with: and MUST delete the state and MUST NOT send a Delete/notify&nbsp; ?<br><br>### Section 3.2.5 Childless IKE SA<br><br>This section explains how to use establish Child SAs without using the<br>IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange.<br><br>I guess I would prefer that there are not two ways to do something, as IKEv2 is<br>already complex enough. But I guess the infrastructure needed for rekeying causes<br>this additional method to creep in whether we want it or not.<br><br>### I did?<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks to Paul Wouters for reviewing the document.<br>```<br>I have no memory of this. Or was this pro-actively added? More serious, I guess I did<br>review this a long long time ago when the document looked very different :)<br><br>### Example is a bit contrived :)<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = PQ_KEM_1)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = PQ_KEM_2)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE1 (ID = NONE)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = PQ_KEM_3)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = PQ_KEM_4)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE2 (ID = NONE)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = PQ_KEM_5)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = PQ_KEM_6)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Transform AKE3 (ID = NONE)<br>```<br>I understand this is just an example to show the processing, but it would be a little odd<br>that both the order of (1|2) before (3|4) before (5|6) would matter if these sets are all<br>themselves optional - they are "optional requirements" ? :)<br><br>### Sending post-quantum proposals and policies in KE payload only<br><br>This solution was rejected because of a downgrade attack. Note though, that a new notify<br>payload of 'I_TRIED_POST_QUANTUM_FIRST' could be sent and the attacker would have been caught<br>in IKE_AUTH by the responder seeing this notify but never having seen the PQ KE payloads.<br>(not saying we should abandon this doc and go back to this proposal :)<br><br><br>### NITS<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; needs to be integrated into IPsec protocol<br>```<br><br>should be "into the IPsec protocol"<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, there does not exist a post-quantum key<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exchange that is trusted at the level that (EC)DH is trusted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; against conventional (non-quantum) adversaries.&nbsp; A hybrid post-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quantum algorithm to be introduced next to well-established<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; primitives, since the overall security is at least as strong as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each individual primitive.<br>```<br><br>I found this hard to read.

The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>The WG consensus is solid. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>No.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Several implementors have been integral in developing this document, thus <br>implementors have indicated interest in implementing this. There is already<br>at least two interoperable implementations of this specification:<br><br>* strongSwan, <a href="https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/tree/ikev2-qske-multi-ke">https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/tree/ikev2-qske-multi-ke</a><br>* ELVIS-PLUS, <a href="http://ipsec.elvis.ru/en.html">http://ipsec.elvis.ru/en.html</a><br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br><br>No. The document has already been reviewed by security area people, and <br>the cryptographic algorithms are not part of this document, but are documented<br>separately.

Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>No.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Proposed Standard as indicated on the title page header and in the datatracker.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>There is one IPR already submitted, and authors have indicated there is no <br>other known IPRs to them.<br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>Authors have indicated willingness to be listed as such. There are 7 authors <br>listed, this document is work of group of authors working on different areas, <br>i.e., some of the authors are experts on the IKEv2, some are concentrated <br>on the cryptographic primitives, and some more to the post quantum in general.<br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>Idnits reports few false positive warnings.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>References are split properly to normative and informative.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>All normative references are now RFCs.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>This document will update <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a> (changes some IANA registry names, and some<br>fields names to more generic form).<br><br>20.

Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>IANA allocations are ok. Note, that one of the authors and shepherd are <br>IANA experts associated with the registries to be modified.<br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>This does not create any new registries, it will rename one old registry <br>and will change name of items in one registry.

The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>The WG consensus is solid. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>No.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?

(It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement?

Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br><br>No. The document has already been reviewed by security area people, and <br>the cryptographic algorithms are not part of this document, but are documented<br>separately. In addition reviews from cryptographers have already been received <br>to the basic protocol.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>None are applicable.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>No automated checks are applicable.<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>No.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Proposed Standard as indicated on the title page header and in the datatracker.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>There is one IPR already submitted, and authors have indicated there is no <br>other known IPRs to them.<br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>Authors have indicated willingness to be listed as such. There are 7 authors <br>listed, this document is work of group of authors working on different areas, <br>i.e., some of the authors are experts on the IKEv2, some are concentrated <br>on the cryptographic primitives, and some more to the post quantum in general.<br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>Idnits reports few false positive warnings.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>References are split properly to normative and informative.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>All normative references are now RFCs.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>This document will update <a href="/doc/rfc7296/">RFC7296</a> (changes some IANA registry names, and some<br>fields names to more generic form).<br><br>20.

Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>No.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Proposed Standard as indicated on the title page header and in the datatracker.<br><br>12.

Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>References are split properly to normative and informative.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>All normative references are now RFCs.<br><br>17.
