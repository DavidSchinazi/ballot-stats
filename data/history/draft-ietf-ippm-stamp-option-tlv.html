 the integrity of that data is also essential.&nbsp; The keyed Hashed<br>&nbsp;  Message Authentication Code (HMAC) TLV MUST be included in a STAMP<br>&nbsp;  test packet in the authenticated mode, excluding when the only TLV<br>&nbsp;  present is Extra Padding TLV.&nbsp; The HMAC TLV MUST follow all TLVs<br><br>(editorial?) I think I can convince myself to read this with two different<br>causalities -- either the HMAC TLV is only allowed to appear in<br>authenticated-mode packets (but can also appear in unauthenticated-mode<br>packets where the only other TLV is the Extra Padding TLV); or in the<br>case when you are sending [this-document] packets in authenticated mode,<br>you MUST also have an HMAC TLV, unless you're sending unauthenticated<br>extended packets where the only TLV present is the Extra Padding TLV.<br>The first interpretation doesn't really make much sense, and the second<br>one is pretty consistent with the follow-up note about "HMAC TLV MAY be<br>used [...] in unauthenticated mode".&nbsp; But I would still suggest<br>rewording for clarity, perhpas "all authenticated STAMP packets<br>compatible with this specification MUST additionally authenticate the<br>option TLVs by including the HMAC TLV, with the sole exception of when<br>there is only one TLV present and it is the Extended Padding TLV".<br><br>&nbsp;  fully applicable to the use of the HMAC TLV.&nbsp; HMAC is calculated as<br>&nbsp;  defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC2104</a>] over text as the concatenation of all preceding<br>&nbsp;  TLVs.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As the secdir reviewer noted, this makes the options severable from the<br>base packet (and separately replayable, the "mix and match" nature).<br>From a cryptographic point of view it's much preferred to include at<br>least some of the base packet (ideally all, though that of course makes<br>precise egress timestamping hard) as HMAC input, to bind the two<br>together.&nbsp; Even including just the sequence number(s) would be a big<br>win.<br><br>&nbsp;  packet.&nbsp; The Session-Reflector MUST copy the remainder of the<br>&nbsp;  extended STAMP test packet into the reflected packet.&nbsp; The Session-<br>&nbsp;  Reflector MUST set the A flag in the copy of the HMAC TLV in the<br>&nbsp;  reflected packet to 1 before transmitting the reflected test packet.<br> <br>This phrasing is a bit weird -- is "the remainder" of the packet all the<br>other TLVs, or just the stuff after the HMAC TLV?&nbsp; We're supposed to<br>process HMAC first, after all, but that's only partially clear from the<br>rest of the section/document...<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines the following new values in the STAMP Extension<br>&nbsp;  TLV range of the STAMP TLV Type registry:<br><br>This appears to be the only instance of "STAMP Extension TLV range" in<br>the document; is this perhaps meant to refer to the "IETF Review" or<br>1-175 range?<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>Do we feel a need to provide any kind of definition for "HW Assist", "SW<br>local", and/or "Control plane"?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>This would be a fine place to reiterate that both Sender and Reflector<br>should have parsers written defensively to protect against malformed<br>(i.e., bad TLV length) input); as I noted previously, the current text<br>really only suggests that the reflector should do so, but the sender is<br>not immune.<br><br>If we leave the U-flag semantics unchanged, we also need to document the<br>potential ambiguity between a reflector that blindly reflects the whole<br>message and one that actually understands all the received TLVs.<br><br>There's also some interesting considerations about the state of the 'A'<br>bit not itself being covered by the response's HMAC TLV (if it is only<br>set in the HMAC TLV vs. all TLVs).&nbsp; I would strongly recommend having<br>Section 4.8 require that the A flag be set in *all* TLVs if<br>authentication fails, so that this information is covered by the<br>response's HMAC TLV.&nbsp; (In the degenerate case of only an HMAC TLV it's<br>still unprotected, but the HMAC itself is over the empty message in that<br>case so it's not terribly interesting to mess with.)&nbsp; Also, the<br>definition of the A flag in Section 4 could probably be tightened up,<br>whichever way we land on this point -- right now it suggests that it<br>might be set on more than just the HMAC TLV but is not very clear.<br>(Interestingly, later on in Section 4 we do seem to say that you have to<br>*check* the A flag in every TLV.)<br><br>We might also consider referencing <a href="/doc/rfc2474/">RFC 2474</a> for the DSCP security<br>considerations.<br><br>Section 9.1<br><br>It's not entirely clear that <a href="/doc/rfc5357/">RFC 5357</a> needs to be normative; we say we<br>can be compatible with lite-mode and that the extended padding is<br>similar, but those are just facts and you don't need to know anything<br>from 5357 to implement this document.<br><br>Similarly, I'm not sure why [TS23501] is listed as normative.<br><br>Section 9.2<br><br>On the other hand, you do actually need to read <a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC 2104</a> to implement<br>the HMAC TLV, which makes it a normative reference (similarly for 4868)!</div></td>

Clarification welcome.<br><br>The A-bit is linked to HMAC and looks like "Authentication" while section 4.8 says HMAC is only for integrity. Hence, why not using "I-bit" rather than "A-bit" (cosmetic issue)<br><br>-- Section 4.1 --<br>For the 'Extra Padding' field, "a pseudo-random sequence of bits.&nbsp; The field MAY be filled with all zeros.". Is it 'bits' or 'octets' ? (the latter most probably). I also have hard time to reconciliate "pseudo-random" with "MAY be filled with 0"; this seems like an oxymoron to me.<br><br>-- Section 4.2 --<br>How to handle cases where the MAC address is not 6-bytes long ? AFAIK IEEE 802.15.4 uses 16 or 64-bit addresses and future MAC layers could use different MAC addresses length. What should be the MAC address field value when there is no associated MAC address?<br><br>-- Section 4.8<br>What is the expected behavior of a Session-Sender when receiving a STAMP packet whose HMAC verification fails ?<br><br>I must also say that I am a little puzzled by the Session-Reflector behavior when HMAC verification fails: logging and replying anyway seems opening an avenue for STAMP service theft or DoS. Or am I missing something ?<br><br>-- Section 5.3 --<br>In table 5, is there a reason why Galileo is not listed ?</div></td>
