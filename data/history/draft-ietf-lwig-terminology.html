Much better would be<br>to have been told that "Fred Bloggs, Joe Blow and<br>A.N.Other" read it and said on the list that they were ok<br>with it.&nbsp; I've worked for large companies and some of our<br>company "experts" were not. And even if they were, they<br>were sometimes more intersted in achieving company goals<br>and not in objectively applying their expertise. (And just<br>in case, for a protocol spec, it would be fine to say that<br>company x have implemented since that's something one could<br>in principle check. So I'm not saying that write-ups ought<br>never mention comapanies.)<br><br>abstract: Devices years ago were arguably far more<br>constrained in some ways than the ones you mean here. The<br>tendency to forget what happened a decade or more ago is a<br>real one, and it'd be good if some lwig document reflected<br>that.&nbsp; That's not really actionable, but if you wanted, you<br>could remove the first sentence of the abstract and still<br>be ok.<br><br>intro: all devices have limited CPU etc. (Except maybe some<br>in THHGTTG:-) That's not entirely a nit - all the<br>terminology here needs to be relative, and relative to what<br>we consider today's "standard candle" which could be a<br>typical laptop. If you re-cast the discussion here in to<br>only use relative terms, (except for examples) then perhaps<br>this terminology could be current for far longer? <br><br>intro: sigh. The Internet has always been made of things.<br>The IoT is of course a new marketing term, but doesn't<br>reflect any new reality really. And "becomes a reality" is<br>just pure marketing which'd be better omitted. <br><br>section 2: why is 5x10^10 an interesting number? That's<br>just 7 devices per person.<br><br>section 2: I don't understand the 2nd bullet at all. What<br>is it meant to say?<br><br>section 2: I disagree with the last sentence - there will<br>always be "constrained" nodes (relative to some standard<br>candle) and both the practical definition of constrained<br>and standard will move as technology develops. I don't see<br>how that *has to* to relate to scaling at all. (There are<br>relationships, but I don't think "scaling down" is<br>causitive.)<br><br>2.1: I assert that mentioning 2013 in the definition is a<br>mistake.<br><br>2.1: A definition that does not consider a smartphone a<br>constrained node seems wrong. Those are differently<br>constrained compared to a tension sensor, but both should<br>be considered constrained IMO. ("My problems are worse than<br>your problems" doesn't seem like a good basis for<br>terminology.)<br><br>2.1, bullet list: I would argue that you ought include<br>"constrained user interfaces" here. (A LED is a user<br>interface as is a factory-reset button, or even a<br>replacable battery arguably.)<br><br>2.1: bullet list: I think you're again making the mistake<br>of not being relative, e.g. "maximum node complexity" isn't<br>even really understandable (why's it a max? can't I just<br>add more? yes, I can!&nbsp; but of course then its a different<br>device). Again the right approach (I claim:-) would be to<br>cast all this in relative terms.<br><br>2.1: batterys vs. harvesting is not a real dichotomy, afaik<br>almost all harvesting nodes have a battery or charge up a<br>capacitor. There are vanishingly few nodes with no energy<br>storage or accumulation mechanism and if they did become<br>popular I suspect they ought be a class of their own. Or am<br>I wrong there?<br><br>2.2: again 2013 in the definition is an error IMO. <br><br>2.2: constrained n/w definition also seems wrong in that<br>there are networks today that are high speed that fit this<br>definition e.g. fibre based networks doing quantum key<br>distribution.<br> <br>2.2.1: I don't think this is really a useful section at<br>all, unless the goal is simply to say that DTN protocols<br>are out of scope, which they are, since all protocols are<br>out of scope. I'd say just delete this section (if you fix<br>the definitions).<br><br>2.3: Just to note that this defintion is fine!<br><br>2.3.x: again you seem to be just dealing with territory<br>here but I guess this could be useful<br><br>3 - I bet you some beers you live to regret using absolute<br>numbers here. I don't find this table that useful. The text<br>definitions saying what the nodes in various classes can<br>and cannot do however is good and should be used in the<br>definitions.<br><br>4.1 says you're not defining classes, but then 4.2 seems to<br>do exactly that, which I find confusing.<br><br>4.2: I'd suggest s/E3/Einf/ so you could introduce new<br>classes when you find out that E0..2 aren't sufficiently<br>descriptive of interesting classes of device. For example,<br>this section doesn't seem to consider duty-cycles which IMO<br>can siginifcantly influence designs and which also provide<br>a handy way to talk about device power requirements and<br>capabilities in a n/w.<br><br>- table 4: Sn as classes is a terrible choice since it<br>conflicts with existing sleep state terminology for ACPI.<br><br>- I agree with the secdir reviewer's suggestion [1] that<br>it'd be good to note the security characteristics of the<br>various classes defined (even if the current classes are<br>kept). A table could usefully do that. (The exercise of<br>generating that table might also help to see if the current<br>class definitions are meaningful.)<br><br>&nbsp;  [1] <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg03964.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg03964.html</a></div></td>

(A LED is a user<br>interface as is a factory-reset button, or even a<br>replacable battery arguably.)<br><br>2.1: bullet list: I think you're again making the mistake<br>of not being relative, e.g. "maximum node complexity" isn't<br>even really understandable (why's it a max? can't I just<br>add more? yes, I can!&nbsp; but of course then its a different<br>device).

It then goes on to use the term<br>"constrained environment" without explaining what this means.<br><br>I think that the Abstract could give several examples of constraint for<br>a node (memory, CPU, power). It could also replace "constrained<br>environment" (which is not used in the rest of the document - except in<br>a similar paragraph in the Introduction) with "constrained network" <br>together with a mention that links may also be constrained, and some<br>examples of link constraints.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>I agree that the definition of Constrained Node "is less than <br>satisfying."&nbsp; Indeed, I think that the definition you provide is useless<br>as a definition.<br><br>I find it odd that the definition includes the reasons why the node is<br>different, but not a list of the ways it might be different. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some of the characteristics that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes in 2013<br><br>...is so vague and unscoped.

It does not, as far as I can tell, discuss the size or<br>scalability of a LLN.<br><br>&nbsp;  The ROLL terminology document states that LLNs typically are composed<br>&nbsp;  of constrained nodes; this is also supported by the design of<br>&nbsp;  operation modes such as RPL's "non-storing mode".&nbsp; So, in the<br>&nbsp;  terminology of the present document, an LLN seems to be a constrained<br>&nbsp;  node network with certain network characteristics, which include<br>&nbsp;  constraints on the network as well.<br><br>What do you mean "is also supported by"? Are you saying that the<br>composition of a network is defined by the widgits built into a protocol<br>that runs over it?<br><br>What do you mean "an LLN seems to be..."

Five supports have been expressed on the mailing list, with positive <br>discussion.&nbsp; <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This is a document that summarizes the terminologies that has been and will be used for <br>people and groups that are working on constrained networks. This is generally considered to be a <br>useful document for people to refer when they would like to find the definition of certain terms.&nbsp; <br>Experts from Philips, Orange, Ericsson reviewed the document, from the time when it still was an <br>individual document. Several wording details in the draft before the WGLC had been discussed <br>and the draft was updated to incorporate these changes.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

Three aspects <br>were reviewed. First, the definitions and descriptions of the terminologies, for example, <br>constrained networks and constrained node networks. Second, the classifications of different <br>types of contrained devices, this section has reflected the discussion on the mailing list and now <br>is used by many drafts. Third, some editorial changes had been posted to the mailing list and the <br>document had been updated to accommodate the changes. . The document shepherd believes <br>that this document is ready for publication. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The Document Shepherd thinks that the review within the group is thorough and comprehensive. <br>While there is considerable overlap in people, explicit review has not yet been performed in <br>other related groups, for example, core, roll, 6lowpan. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>NO. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>NO<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The WG understand and agree with it.&nbsp; During the WGLC, the WG received five messages from <br>key participants from the group and all of them supported it moving forward. On several <br>meetings before, the chairs asked for hum for support of its merits as a right directions, and clear <br>conconsus was received. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent?
