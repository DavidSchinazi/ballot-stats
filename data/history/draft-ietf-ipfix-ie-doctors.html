I make a suggestion here, but I'm not sure I've captured what needs to be captured. The WG needs to check this:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document provides guidelines for how to write definitions of new<br>&nbsp;  Information Elements for the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)<br>&nbsp;  protocol. It provides instructions on using the proper conventions<br>&nbsp;  for Information Elements to be registered in the IANA IPFIX<br>&nbsp;  Information Element registry, and provides guidelines for expert<br>&nbsp;  reviewers to evaluate new registrations.<br><br>I'll leave it to the authors to rewrite section 1 along the same lines. In section 1.1, I think you specifically need to mention people who write new IEs and *not* talk about "extending the applicability of IPFIX", as that confused the issue. I also find the use of the word "application" a bit odd here, and I've substituted "use case", but if "application" is understood in this community, that is fine. So, maybe something like:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is meant for two separate audiences. For those wishing<br>&nbsp;  to write new Information Element specifications, it provides<br>&nbsp;  guidelines for how to decide which Information Elements are necessary<br>&nbsp;  for a given existing or new use case, instructions for writing the<br>&nbsp;  Information Element specification to be registered, and information<br>&nbsp;  on the kinds of documentation that will be required for the use case<br>&nbsp;  (up to and including publication of a new RFC). For the IPFIX<br>&nbsp;  experts...<br><br>2. Regarding 2119: I agree with Adrian that the use of 2119 language in this document is wrong, and verges on downright silly. This document is not talking about protocol requirements, or even documentation requirements that need to be followed for interoperability purposes. So for instance, section 4.1 says, "Information Element Names should be defined in accordance with section 2.3 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis/">I-D.ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis</a>]" and then goes on to give some conventions as MUSTs and SHOULDs. But if we look at ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis, we find:<br><br>&nbsp;  The following naming conventions were used for naming Information<br>&nbsp;  Elements in this document.&nbsp; It is recommended that extensions of the<br>&nbsp;  model use the same conventions.<br><br>So even the MUSTs are not requirements, but recommended naming conventions for extensions. I really think you should get rid of all of the 2119 language.<br><br>That said, you'll note that this is in a COMMENT. I think for the most part, while useless and silly (it sounds like you are trying to be protocol police), using 2119 in this document is generally not harmful. I am most worried about the use of 2119 to control IANA actions (e.g., 4.3), but even there, disaster is unlikely. So I do beg with you to revisit your decision to use 2119 in this document; I think it adds nothing and detracts from the understanding of 2119 in other documents. But I will not insist on DISCUSSing this with the IESG.</div></td>

Details has been discussed extensively.<br>WGLC was conducted in February 2012. Raise issues in the LC<br>Phase were discussed and fixed.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>This BCP for IPFIX IE doctors summarizes experiences gained in<br>several years of dealing with new proposals for IEs.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>By default, Benoit Claise would be the responsible area director.<br>But since Benoit Claise is co-author of the draft, the responsible<br>area director is Ron Bonica.<br>Document shepherd is Juergen Quittek.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd has reviewed the draft and is fully convinced<br>that it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>There are no such issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.
