See comments below particularly regarding batteries:<br><br>1:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The framework also covers monitoring and control of batteries <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  contained in devices.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>We had this discussion back when the requirements document came out. Characterizing batteries as contained in a device is not right. It is a view of batteries for small devices that might work, but for systems where batteries are a receiver and producer of power, I think it's a bad model. (Similar comment for the description of Components in section 3.)<br><br>2: In the definitions:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1. Power Attributes are not intended to be judgmental <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  with respect to a reference or technical value and are <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  independent of any usage context.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>"judgmental" is the wrong word here. What do you mean?<br><br>6.3.4 &amp; 6.3.5 lack any indication of an awareness of internationalization. Are you really saying that *any* characters are allowed except for comma? If so, at least mention that alphanumeric and symbol characters from the entire Unicode repertoire are expected to be reasonable.<br><br>6.6.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o Transitive Power Source relationships SHOULD NOT be <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  established.&nbsp; For example, if an Energy Object A has <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a Power Source Relationship "Poweredby" with the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Energy Object B, and if the Energy Object B has a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Power Source Relationship "Poweredby" with the Energy <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Object C, then the Energy Object A SHOULD NOT have a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Power Source Relationship "Poweredby" with the Energy <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Object C.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Why is that? I can certainly imagine a generator powering a UPS, the UPS powering a device, and the generator also powering that device. Are you simply saying that the "Poweredby" relationship gets established and destroyed dynamically? So when the device is being powered by the generator, it is not being powered by the UPS, so the Poweredby relationship between the UPS and the device goes away? (I'm still a bit concerned about load sharing power sources, like two producers on a grid, but maybe that can be finessed.) The SHOULD NOT seems a bit strong.<br><br>12.1.4: This is making me very nervous. The only thing I've seen from this group on batteries is the battery mib, and it is completely inappropriate for battery banks for energy systems. The list of battery technologies it talks about are clearly only small batteries for small devices (I don't see gel batteries or absorbed glass mat on the list, though maybe AGMs are suposed to be lead acid), and measurements are only defined in units like milliamperes. That's not a general battery mib, and certainly not one that can be seriously used for batteries in a large scale energy management system. Now this section of the document says that this document is not handling power state sets for batteries. I am not filled with confidence that this group is getting good review from a wide enough audience (outside of the IETF).</div></td>

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There have been a number of WG last calls on this document. Between versions 10 and 11, the WG Chairs constrained changes to just those between versions 9 and 10 and discussed this plan during IETF88. There were no comments received on the list, nor where there any objections to moving the draft forward. <br><br>Response to the WG adoption call was . There has been significant discussion on-list and at IETF meetings by those who have implemented the EMAN MIBs which are use this draft as a framework/guide.&nbsp; Response to last call depends on the last call issued. The details are provided below:<br><br>IETF-87: Most issues resolved, WG Last Call started for -09 version<br> on 11 September 2013.&nbsp; That brought four detailed reviews; the authors<br> worked through the issues raised.<br><br>IETF-88: Version -08 (July 2013) discussed, remaining five issues resolved.<br> Agreed that the WG would have a two-week discussion period on the<br> EMAN list, then the draft authors would make the changes agreed<br> at IETF-88 and publish a new version.<br><br> Four more revisions have been published since. <br> A final WG LC was called on November 5, 2013 and concluded two weeks afterwards.&nbsp; <br><br> The authors (and the WG) now believe that version -12 is ready to submit to IESG for publication.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction?

The information<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; model consists of an Energy Management Domain as a set of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Energy Objects. Each Energy Object can be attributed with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; identity, classification, and context.&nbsp; Energy Objects can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be monitored and controlled with respect to power, Power<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and battery. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally the framework models relationships and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; capabilities between Energy Objects. <br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Working Group Summary:<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  This document is an EMAN Working Group document, adopted in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  12/22/2010, and which passed WG last call in July 2010.&nbsp; The doc was well<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  reviewed in the WG up to WG last call, and was updated to include <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  corrections to address comments on 1/11/2014.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br><br><br>The Document Shepherd did a full review of the text of version 11 of the draft as did a numebr of WG members, leading to the authors issuing versions 12 with various fixes.&nbsp; The document shepherd has also scanned through the mail archives and previous IETF meeting minutes to review debates on the draft. The document shepherd's view is that this is now ready for publication.&nbsp; The notes from the history of the document are included below as there is some considerable history regarding this document in the WG:<br><br>IETF-83: Nevil replaced Benoit as WG Co-chair early in March 2012<br> The Framework draft was well advanced by then, but its five authors<br> had a long list of issues to be addressed.<br><br>IETF-84: The WG agreed that issues needed to be handled<br> systematically, so we began 'authors meetings,' using the DataTracker<br> to document issues and their resolutions, with Nevil chairing the<br> weekly meetings. Draft revision -05.<br><br>IETF-85: 26 issues, 13 resolved, draft version -05.<br><br>IETF-86: 14 more issues closed, new issues opened.&nbsp; Draft revision -07.<br><br>June 2013: Bruce Nordman withdrew from being a Framework author<br> and an EMAN co-chair.&nbsp; Tom Nadeau replaced him as EMAN co-chair<br><br>IETF-87: Most issues resolved, WG Last Call started for -09 version<br> on 11 September 2013.&nbsp; That brought four detailed reviews; the authors<br> worked through the issues raised.<br><br>IETF-88: Version -08 (July 2013) discussed, remaining five issues resolved.<br> Agreed that the WG would have a two-week discussion period on the<br> EMAN list, then the draft authors would make the changes agreed<br> at IETF-88 and publish a new version.<br><br> Four more revisions have been published since, the authors (and the WG)<br>now believe that version -12 is ready to submit to IESG for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.&nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document multiple times, as has my WG co-chair through various iterations.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>Yes. Disclosure 2161: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2161/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2161/</a><br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There have been a number of WG last calls on this document. Between versions 10 and 11, the WG Chairs constrained changes to just those between versions 9 and 10 and discussed this plan during IETF88. There were no comments received on the list, nor where there any objections to moving the draft forward. <br><br>Response to the WG adoption call was . There has been significant discussion on-list and at IETF meetings by those who have implemented the EMAN MIBs which are use this draft as a framework/guide.&nbsp; Response to last call depends on the last call issued. The details are provided below:<br><br>IETF-87: Most issues resolved, WG Last Call started for -09 version<br> on 11 September 2013.&nbsp; That brought four detailed reviews; the authors<br> worked through the issues raised.<br><br>IETF-88: Version -08 (July 2013) discussed, remaining five issues resolved.<br> Agreed that the WG would have a two-week discussion period on the<br> EMAN list, then the draft authors would make the changes agreed<br> at IETF-88 and publish a new version.<br><br> Four more revisions have been published since. <br> A final WG LC was called on November 5, 2013 and concluded two weeks afterwards.&nbsp; <br><br> The authors (and the WG) now believe that version -12 is ready to submit to IESG for publication.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>I ran IDNits on the previous version and discovered one error and some dangling references which the authors corrected in version 13. There are no errors found, but still a numebr of warmings that can be corrected by the RFC Editor.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Numerous working group reviews, including detailed reviews by the co-chairs. <br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br><br>The IANA considerations section consists of a note to the RFC editor requesting that IANA create a registry based on detailed instructions in section 12.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>A new registry of new power state sets based on IEEE1621 is requested that allows for changes through the expert review process.&nbsp;  Experts used to review this registry should be well skilled in the details from IEEE1621 as well as energy management practices. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>None.<br><br><br><br><br></div></td>
