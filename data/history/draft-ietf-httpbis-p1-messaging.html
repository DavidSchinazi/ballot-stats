What I think it means is that my reader should process the stream as UTF-8, storing it in a normalized Unicode format, either failing to process the request or doing something "sensible" when bad UTF-8 sequences are encountered, and the normalized Unicode should then be passed to the parser that parses the header lines.

That's fine, but I would ask that you make this clearer somewhere in section 3 of the p1 document. You talk about the parsing, but I think it is well worth describing that there are two levels of ABNF, and that the ABNF rule name corresponds to the header field name. It is fine to do it this way, but it's not the way that ABNF has been used in the past, so best to make it crystal clear.<br><br>Specific comments:<br><br>1:<br><br>&nbsp;  This HTTP/1.1 specification obsoletes and moves to historic status<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC 2616</a>, its predecessor <a href="/doc/rfc2068/">RFC 2068</a>, and <a href="/doc/rfc2145/">RFC 2145</a> (on HTTP<br>&nbsp;  versioning).<br>&nbsp;  <br>Please, no, it doesn't (and shouldn't) move any of these documents to Historic (even if it were capitalized correctly ;-) ). It obsoletes them. Please strike "and moves to historic status". (I'm happy to give you the long explanation of why moving to Historic is not the right thing if you like.)<br><br>Also, an editorial nit: I find the "we" affectation distracting. Sounds like an academic paper. 11 occurrences in this document. "This document" or "this specification" (or simply switching to the passive voice) are much more IETF-like.<br><br>2.3 (Editorial nit) "...upstream to downstream. Likewise, we use...". It's not "Likewise" here. "Upstream" and "downstream" are only about the direction of the message and don't have anything to do with who sent/received it. "Inbound" and "outbound" refer to direction based on who it's coming from (UA or OS). Strike "Likewise".<br><br>2.5, para 8 (and ff): I'm not a fan of the "MUST..., unless..." construct. People get into stupid conformance arguments over such things. I prefer "MUST either..., or ..." or "SHOULD..., the primary exception being...".<br><br>2.7.1, para 6: Why "MAY"? What else could it do? Is this a protocol option of some sort?<br>para 7: The concept of "establishing authority" is not well explained here. What's the import of it?<br>para 8: Why "ought to"? That seems like a fine candidate for a "SHOULD": You're giving implementation advice to avoid damage.<br><br><br>3.2.4:<br><br>&nbsp;  A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace from a<br>&nbsp;  response message before forwarding the message downstream.<br><br>Really? Wouldn't that cause the aforementioned "security vulnerability"?<br><br>&nbsp;  A field value is preceded by optional whitespace (OWS)...<br><br>"...and/or followed...", right?<br><br>3.2.6: This is your only use of the term "escape". A bit imprecise. I suggest reusing the quoted-pair text for quoted-cpair.<br><br>3.3.1: "encoding parameters MAY be provided by other header fields". I think MAY is wrong there. "Can"?<br><br>3.3.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  A sender MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any message<br>&nbsp;  that contains a Transfer-Encoding header field.<br><br>Why not? Can there not ever be a Transfer-Encoding that has no implicit length? I read 3.3.3 sub 3 and I still don't get it.<br><br>4.1: I presume chunk-size can't be "0" even though the ABNF allows it?<br><br>4.1.1: quoted-string doesn't allow folding, does it? Why do you need a new quoted-str-nf?<br><br>5.5, first paragraph: Why do you have "MUST reconstruct" instead of "reconstructs", or simply reversing the sense of the whole paragraph and say, "An 'effective request URI' is a reconstruction of the user agent's original target URI"? I haven't found anything in the documents that says that effective request URIs are going to be passed as protocol parameters, but rather they are for local processing and comparison.

It's not "Likewise" here. "Upstream" and "downstream" are only about the direction of the message and don't have anything to do with who sent/received it.
