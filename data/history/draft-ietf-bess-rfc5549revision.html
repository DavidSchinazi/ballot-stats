Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of usable<br>&nbsp;  next-hop address families is determined by the Address Family<br>&nbsp;  Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI).<br>&nbsp;  The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only<br>&nbsp;  have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to<br>&nbsp;  the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 Network Layer Reachability<br>&nbsp;  Information (NLRI) or VPN-IPv4 NLRI.&nbsp; This document specifies the<br>&nbsp;  extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI<br>&nbsp;  with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the<br>&nbsp;  address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong<br>&nbsp;  to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop to determine which<br>&nbsp;  of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP<br>&nbsp;  Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they<br>&nbsp;  can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document was developed as a response to an observed gap in the current specifications<br>&nbsp;  that did not reflect deployed implementations.<br>&nbsp;  The ability to advertise an IPv6 next hop in an IPv4/VPN-IPv4 NLRI is something<br>&nbsp;  that has been implemented and deployed and this document reflects the need to <br>&nbsp;  standardise the procedures to ensure future interoperability. It also introduces <br>&nbsp;  a new capability advertisement for this. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  This document was coordinated with the chairs of the IDR working group. It was progressed<br>&nbsp;  in the BESS working group since most applications for it reside within the charter<br>&nbsp;  of BESS. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR declarations on the draft . <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document. I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed both on the list and in <br>&nbsp;  face-to-face meetings. <br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need <br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@nokia.com">matthew.bocci@nokia.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Martin Vigoureux (<a href="mailto:martin.vigoureux@nokia.com">martin.vigoureux@nokia.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v01 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that were resolved in<br>&nbsp; version 02. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author listed in the Authors Addresses section has personally indicated that<br>&nbsp;  they are not aware of any IPR that has not already been declared in accordance<br>&nbsp;  with <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and 79.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR declarations on the draft.<br><br><br>&nbsp; <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It received a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; number of comments and significant discussion at IETF meetings. There were no <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; objections during last call, and comments were constructive and supportive of moving <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the draft forward. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ID-Nits passes. <br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no relevant formal review criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. All references are explicitly identified as informative or normative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc5549/">RFC 5549</a>. It is properly indicated in the <br>&nbsp; document header, the abstract and the introduction.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no sections containing formal language that needs reviewing.</div></td>

I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed both on the list and in <br>&nbsp;  face-to-face meetings. <br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need <br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@nokia.com">matthew.bocci@nokia.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Martin Vigoureux (<a href="mailto:martin.vigoureux@nokia.com">martin.vigoureux@nokia.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v01 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that were resolved in<br>&nbsp; version 02. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It received a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; number of comments and significant discussion at IETF meetings. There were no <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; objections during last call, and comments were constructive and supportive of moving <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the draft forward. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ID-Nits passes. <br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no relevant formal review criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. All references are explicitly identified as informative or normative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no sections containing formal language that needs reviewing.</div></td>
