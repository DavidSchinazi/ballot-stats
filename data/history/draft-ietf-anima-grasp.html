I guess a SHOULD for caching would be sufficient.<br>- section 3.8.6 "If a node receives a Request message for an objective for which no<br>&nbsp;  ASA is currently listening, it MUST immediately close the relevant<br>&nbsp;  socket to indicate this to the initiator."<br>&nbsp;  How is that indicated? Should really be further clarified<br>- Also section 3.8.6: "In case of a clash, it MUST discard the Request message, in<br>&nbsp;  which case the initiator will detect a timeout."<br>&nbsp;  Why don't you send an error message instead? How does the initiator know that is should retry (assuming there is a TCP connection underneath that provides reliable transport)?<br>- Also section 3.8.9: "If not, the initiator MUST abandon or restart the negotiation<br>&nbsp;  procedure, to avoid an indefinite wait."<br>&nbsp; How does the initiator decide for abandoning or restarting instead? Needs clarification!<br>- Could be useful to include an optional reasoning field in the Invalid Message and make copying the received message up to the maximum message size of this message a SHOULD (section 3.8.12.).<br>- Not sure I fully understand the purpose of the No Operation Message (section 3.8.13.). If you just want to open a socket for probing, you perform a TCP handshake and send a RST right after. No need for further application layer interactions. And should there also be an optional reasoning phrase?<br>- Not sure why the objectives flag is needed. I assume that unknown objectives are ignored anyway and if a objective is known the receiver should know if that objective is valid for the respective message type (section 3.10.2).<br>- section 3.10.4: "An issue requiring particular attention is that GRASP itself is a stateless protocol."<br>&nbsp;  It's not. It caches information and needs to remember previous messages sent to reply correctly.<br>- section 5: "Generally speaking, no personal information is expected to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; involved in the signaling protocol, so there should be no direct impact on personal privacy."<br>&nbsp;  I don't think this is true because the protocol is so generic that you cannot say anything about the services it is used for.<br>Please see also further comments from Martin's tsv-art review (Thanks again!)!</div></td>

Delete from "nodes need a consistent, although partial, view of the<br>network topology in order for the routing algorithm to converge.&nbsp; Also,<br>routing is mainly based on simple information synchronization between<br>peers, rather than on bi-directional negotiation." I think what you want to<br>infer by "partial" is for a protocol instance/region. But there is support today<br>for multi-layer and multi-region networks. And convergence scale is<br>implementation.

Every usage of UDP is required by IETF consensus to review <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC 8085</a> and to address at least the applicable subset of issues listed in <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC 8085</a> (or the predecessor <a href="/doc/rfc5405/">RFC 5405</a>).<br><br>* Starting with UDP and switching to TCP for the data transfer looks like the right do. However, UDP should be really only used to discover other devices, but not piggy back further protocol mechanics. However, this document is not really specific on how to make use of TCP, for instance, how long are TCP connections kept open or closed down after a protocol exchange (persistent vs temporary connections). What happens if a TCP connection is shutdown by one end or is forcefully closed, e.g., by a reset?"<br><br>I would recommend, as assumed in the rest of the document, to update section 3.5.3 to only use UDP for the initial recovery message and open a TCP connection for the discovery response and require that all other messages to be sent over TCP (also removing any option to use any other reliable transport because TCP seems to be the right choice here.) Further, additional guidance is needed when to open and close a TCP connection (or keep it alive for later use) and what to do if the connection is interrupted.<br><br>2) Time-out handling<br>section 3.5.4.4: "Since the relay device is unaware of the timeout set by the original<br>&nbsp;  initiator it SHOULD set a timeout at least equal to GRASP_DEF_TIMEOUT<br>&nbsp;  milliseconds."<br>Should a relay really maintain an own time-out? Wouldn't it be sufficient to just relay again if another discovery message is received. Otherwise this can lead to an amplification, when the own time-out expires and another relay message is sent when another discovery message is received due to the time-out of the originating peer.<br><br>Further in relation to the point about, this should be more specific:<br>section 3.5.4.4: "Also, it MUST limit the total rate at which it relays<br>&nbsp;  discovery messages to a reasonable value, in order to mitigate<br>&nbsp;  possible denial of service attacks.

Also, is there a retry limit?&nbsp; (Comment applies to the other sections that mention retries with exponential backoff)<br><br>-3.5.6.2: "To ensure that flooding does not result in a loop, the originator of<br>&nbsp;  the Flood Synchronization message MUST set the loop count in the<br>&nbsp;  objectives to a suitable value "<br>I assume this is true for discovery and negotiation as well? I don't think it was mentioned in those sections (although I think I saw a related mention in the message format sections.)<br><br>- 3.10.5: "SHOULD NOT be used in<br>&nbsp;  unmanaged networks such as home networks."<br>Why not MUST?<br><br>-5, Privacy and Confidentiality: Did people consider IP Addresses and other potentially persistent identifiers as impacting privacy?<br><br>-7, Grasp Message and Options table: Why "Standards Action"? Would you expect some harm to be done if this were only Spec Required?<br><br>Editorial:<br><br>- Is section 2 expected to be useful to implementers once this is published as an RFC? Unless there's a reason otherwise, I would suggest moving this to an appendix, or even removing it entirely. As it is, you have to wade through an unusual amount of front material before you get to the meat of the protocol.<br><br>- Along the lines of the previous comment, I found the organization a bit hard to follow. I didn't find actual protocol details until around page 21. Procedures are split (and sometimes repeated) between the procedure sections and the message format sections. I think that will make this more difficult and error prone than necessary for implementors to read and reference.&nbsp; I fear readers will read one section and think they understand the procedures, and miss a requirement in the other.<br><br>- 3.5.2.2: First bullet:<br>Please consider a "MUST NOT construction. "MUST only" can be ambiguous.<br>It would be helpful to explain why the loop count must not be more than one. I can infer that from the later sections on relays, but it was not obvious when reading this section. And unless I missed something, there's no text that puts the two ideas together.<br><br>- 3.5.4.5: This section seems redundant to the similar sections under negotiation . Since those sections have more information, would it make sense to consolidate them there?</div></td>

While the document *does* say that readers should be familiar with <a href="/doc/rfc7575/">RFC7575</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7576/">RFC7576</a>, and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-anima-reference-model/">I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model</a>, I think it would still be helpful to (briefly) describe an objective here, or simply mention that "technical objective" is a term of art and point to the Terminology section (or Sec. 3.10). When I initially read this it sounded incredibly broad, once I found the Terminology section it all made more sense...<br><br><br>S2.2.&nbsp; Requirements for Synchronization and Negotiation Capability<br><br>&nbsp;  "SN5. <br>&nbsp;  ...<br>&nbsp;  It follows that the protocol’s resource requirements must be appropriate for any device that would otherwise need human intervention." <br><br>I found this sentence confusing / hard to parse. I *think* that you are saying that the protocol should not require so many resources that it cannot be deployed on devices (and so humans would still need to manually manage them)?<br>If so, I think that this could be clearer, but, unfortunately I cannot provide better text...<br><br>3.2.&nbsp; High Level Deployment Model<br>"A more common model is expected to be a multi-purpose device capable of containing several ASAs."<br>I'm sure you are right... but for a reader new to the topic this is not obvious (nor clear) - would it be possible to provide some sort of examples of such devices (or brief description of why a more common model would have several ASAs?)

Do you think that it will somehow make people write better / more robust code? If so, shouldn't this be in our standard boilerplate? This whole paragraph feels like it is not actionable / is something that all code for all implementations of everything should follow...

If not, this may be <br>an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the requirements for a signaling <br>&nbsp;  protocol that enables autonomic devices and autonomic service <br>&nbsp;  agents to dynamically discover peers, to synchronize state with <br>&nbsp;  them, and to negotiate parameter settings mutually with them.<br>&nbsp;  The document then defines a general protocol for discovery, <br>&nbsp;  synchronization and negotiation, which can be suitable for variable<br>&nbsp;  technical objectives. The technical objectives for specific scenarios<br>&nbsp;  out of scope.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>&nbsp; This document was called <a href="/doc/draft-carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol/">draft-carpenter-anima-gdn-protocol</a> <br>&nbsp; prior to its adoption. There was unanimous support for it in favor of <br>&nbsp; adoption and none against), so this document was adopted in August<br>&nbsp; 2015. There was interest in this work posts since its adoption. <br>&nbsp; There was never any opposition for this work.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This document went through a relevant long document development<br>&nbsp; period (10 months for individual document period, 17 month for WG <br>&nbsp; document period). It has been reviewed well.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was<br>a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the <br>request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; This document went through multiple reviews by multiple WG<br>&nbsp; participants.&nbsp; There are at least two existing implementations. <br>&nbsp; Both Cisco and Huawei showed interests to implement the specification<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Sheng Jiang is the document shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Terry Manderson is the responsible AD.<br>&nbsp; <br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication,<br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; I reviewed this document thorough once for -05 versions (and had<br>&nbsp; other minor comments from time to time):<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/anima/current/msg02045.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/anima/current/msg02045.html</a>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; The issues raised in my reviews were promptly addressed by authors<br>&nbsp; in -06 version along with the comments from other ANIMA WG members.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This document -09 version is ready for publication in my opinion.<br>&nbsp; <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of<br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with<br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware<br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the<br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br>if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no outstanding issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. The authors, Brian Carpenter, Carsten Bormann, and Bing Liu have<br>&nbsp; confirmed in writing that they are not aware of any IPR, and that any <br>&nbsp; and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with <br>&nbsp; the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br>&nbsp; <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There was broad support for this document. It was reviewed by active WG <br>&nbsp; participants. All changes were mostly minor.<br>&nbsp; <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br>&nbsp; <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; This document is now ID nits clean.<br>&nbsp; <br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such<br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No MIB Doctor, media type, URI type or similar apply to this<br>&nbsp; document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references<br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No. All normative references are published RFCs.<br>&nbsp; <br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so,<br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call<br>procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. There are one no downard normative references.<br>&nbsp; draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl. It is intended to be adopted by <br>&nbsp; the new CBOR WG and it is a chartered WG item with a milestone of October<br>&nbsp; 2017. Alternatively, this GRASP draft could add an Appendix that defines<br>&nbsp; the specific GRASPS subset of CDDL formally in ABNF, and reduce <br>&nbsp; the CDDL draft reference to Informational.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No. This document does not update any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA is asked to assign 2 multicast addresses for ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBOR<br>&nbsp; multicast address (IPv6) and ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBOR multicast address (IPv4);<br>&nbsp; 1 port for both UDP and TCP: GRASP_LISTEN_PORT.<br><br>&nbsp; IANA is requested to create a GRASP Parameter Registry including<br>&nbsp; two registry tables: the GRASP Messages and Options Table and the<br>&nbsp; GRASP Objective Names Table. In the the GRASP Messages and Options <br>&nbsp; Table, 18 intial values are assigned for M_NOOP, M_DISCOVERY,<br>&nbsp; M_RESPONSE, M_REQ_NEG, M_REQ_SYN, M_NEGOTIATE, M_END, M_WAIT,<br>&nbsp; M_SYNCH, M_FLOOD, M_INVALID, O_DIVERT, O_ACCEPT, O_DECLINE,<br>&nbsp; O_IPv6_LOCATOR, O_IPv4_LOCATOR, O_FQDN_LOCATOR and O_URI_LOCATO. There is<br>&nbsp; no initial value assigned in the GRASP Objective Names Table.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; All the necessary information is in the IANA considerations document. It is<br>&nbsp; clear enough that the IANA will be able to implement it.<br>&nbsp; <br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such registry is requested in this document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no such parts to the document.</div></td>
