Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document provides a guide for vendors to extend existing auto-install<br>&nbsp;  / Zero-Touch Provisioning mechanisms to make the process more secure for<br>&nbsp;  operators.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document receives a modest amount of discussion and was reviewed by a<br>number of people who provided useful additions.&nbsp; Given that the document is<br>a guide and does not specify a directly implementable protocol, it was<br>difficult for reviewers to say very much about the protocol, as the details<br>will be up to vendors who implement this.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>No vendors have committed to implement this protocol.<br>The document still contains a number of editorial [] notes, some of which<br>make the document seem very uncertain.&nbsp; Ignoring the notes, the document is<br>actually quite mature.<br><br>No MIB or YANG doctor was needed.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Michael Richardson.<br>The Responsible area Director is Ignas Bagdonas<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IESG.<br><br>The Document Shepherd first read the document during the adoption discussion,<br>and reviewed it again end to end (version -05) during the WGLC.<br>A review of the differences from 00 to 05 was made to understand whether the<br>input of the WG was taken into account, it the changes seem reasonable.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>The document makes very soft security requirements, and has not at this point<br>received a security review.&nbsp; More security review was asked for by the WG at<br>various times, but it has not yet been received.<br>In the review of the mailing list, there were instances of threads of<br>comments from a few people, and it was not always clear from the interaction<br>if the comments were acted upon.<br><br>The document relies upon vendor practice to create key pairs, and for vendors<br>to create detailed mechanisms.&nbsp; It is difficult to throw any rocks at this<br>document, as there is no specific protocol to evaluate: equipment vendors<br>will have to do a lot of work to finish things out, and the results will be<br>vendor specific. (That's why this is not standards track)<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The only component which is specifically mentioned is DHCP, and it does not<br>define any new DHCP behaviour or define any new DHCP options, so a DHCP<br>review is not necessary.<br>Had the document suggested a specific mechanism for encryption (CMS, OpenPGP,<br>JOSE, etc.) then a review there would be useful, but it leaves that decision<br>to vendors.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors have confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The WG consensus is weak.&nbsp; The document is the result of a strong concurrence<br>of a few individuals, most others are silent.&nbsp;  As OPSAWG is a rather loose<br>group of people, this is probably as strong a consensus as one will get.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No one has threatened an appeal<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Checklist).

If such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>Yes.<br>The document speaks about DHCP, but does not reference any DHCP specifications.<br>Perhaps it should.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Call procedure.<br><br>no.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not update any other document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are<br>associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that<br>any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that<br>newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial<br>contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future<br>registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has<br>been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>There are no IANA Considerations, and none are needed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd<br>to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as<br>XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>none.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with<br>any of the recommended validation tools<br>(<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and<br>formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Why is this the proper<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>This document is intended as Informational.<br>This document does not proscribe any specific protocol or mechanism, but<br>rather outlines a general technique.&nbsp; The details of how to do the<br>encryption, or how to deliver the encrypted configuration file are left to<br>vendors to define, using some choice of available protocols.<br>As such, it is inappropriate for this to be standards track.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document provides a guide for vendors to extend existing auto-install<br>&nbsp;  / Zero-Touch Provisioning mechanisms to make the process more secure for<br>&nbsp;  operators.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document receives a modest amount of discussion and was reviewed by a<br>number of people who provided useful additions.&nbsp; Given that the document is<br>a guide and does not specify a directly implementable protocol, it was<br>difficult for reviewers to say very much about the protocol, as the details<br>will be up to vendors who implement this.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>No vendors have committed to implement this protocol.<br>The document still contains a number of editorial [] notes, some of which<br>make the document seem very uncertain.&nbsp; Ignoring the notes, the document is<br>actually quite mature.<br><br>No MIB or YANG doctor was needed.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Michael Richardson.<br>The Responsible area Director is Ignas Bagdonas<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IESG.<br><br>The Document Shepherd first read the document during the adoption discussion,<br>and reviewed it again end to end (version -05) during the WGLC.<br>A review of the differences from 00 to 05 was made to understand whether the<br>input of the WG was taken into account, the changes seem reasonable.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>The document makes very soft security requirements, and has not at this point<br>received a security review.&nbsp; More security review was asked for by the WG at<br>various tims, and it is not clear that this input will be taken into account.<br><br>The document relies upon vendor practice to create key pairs, and for vendors<br>to create detailed mechanisms.&nbsp; It is difficult to throw any rocks at this<br>document, as there is no specific protocol to evaluate: equipment vendors<br>will have to do a lot of work to finish things out, and the results will be<br>vendor specific. (That's why this is not standards track)<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The only component which is specifically mentioned is DHCP, and it does not<br>define any new DHCP behaviour or define any new DHCP options, so a DHCP<br>review is not necessary.<br>Had the document suggested a specific mechanism for encryption (CMS, OpenPGP,<br>JOSE, etc.) then a review there would be useful, but it leaves that decision<br>to vendors.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors have confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The WG consensus is weak.&nbsp; The document is the result of a strong concurrence<br>of a few individuals, most others are silent.&nbsp;  As OPSAWG is a rather loose<br>group of people, this is probably as strong a consensus as one will get.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No one has threatened an appeal<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Checklist).

If such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>Yes.<br>The document speaks about DHCP, but does not reference any DHCP specifications.<br>Perhaps it should.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Call procedure.<br><br>no.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not update any other document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are<br>associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that<br>any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that<br>newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial<br>contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future<br>registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has<br>been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>There are no IANA Considerations, and none are needed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd<br>to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as<br>XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>none.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with<br>any of the recommended validation tools<br>(<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and<br>formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>the justification for not fixing them at this time?
