Maybe move those paragraphs somewhere else...? Also the part about "long-lived operations" and messages types provides far more information than just terminology and I would recommend to also move it into an own section or maybe just have it as part of the intro.<br><br>2) Maybe call section 5 "Protocol specification" instead of "Protocol details"...?<br><br>3) Sec 5.1: "DSO messages MUST be carried in only protocols and in environments<br>&nbsp;  where a session may be established according to the definition given<br>&nbsp;  above in the Terminology section (Section 3)."<br>I don't get this. Which part of section 3? Given section 3 is on terminology and this is a normative statement, I would recommend to spell out here explicitly what is meant. Do you mean the protocol must be connection-oriented, reliable, and providing in-order delivery? Any thing else? However, given that you say two paragraphs onwards that this spec is only applicable for the use with TCP and TLS/TCP, do you even need to specify these requirements normatively? <br><br>4) sec 5.1 "It is a common<br>&nbsp;  convention that protocols specified to run over TLS are given IANA<br>&nbsp;  service type names ending in "-tls"."<br>Not sure this is true. Isn't it usually just an "s" at the end? Or with registry are you talking about?<br><br>5) sec 5.1: "In some environments it may be known in advance by external means<br>&nbsp;  that both client and server support DSO, ..."<br>I guess the client and server also need to know if TLS is supported or not. Maybe spell this out as well.<br><br>6) sec 5.1: "... therefore either<br>&nbsp;  client or server may be the initiator of a message."<br>Maybe s/initiator of a message/initiator of a message exchange/<br><br>7) sec 5.1.2: "Having initiated a connection to a server, possibly using zero round-<br>&nbsp;  trip TCP Fast Open and/or zero round-trip TLS 1.3, a client MAY send<br>&nbsp;  multiple response-requiring DSO request messages to the server in<br>&nbsp;  succession without having to wait for a response to the first request<br>&nbsp;  message to confirm successful establishment of a DSO session."<br>Why is the ability to send more than one request related to TCP Fast Open/TLS1.3 0-RTT? These are two independent mechanisms to speed up processing. Mentioning TCP Fast Open/TLS1.3 0-RTT here is rather confusing. Respectively I also don't think that the sentence:<br>"Similarly, DSO supports zero round-trip operation." is describing quite the same.<br> <br>8) Further please provide references to TCP Fast Open and TLS1.3 and maybe rephrase this paragraph to use normative language:<br>"Caution must be taken to ensure that DSO messages sent before the<br>&nbsp;  first round-trip is completed are idempotent, or are otherwise immune<br>&nbsp;  to any problems that could be result from the inadvertent replay that<br>&nbsp;  can occur with zero round-trip operation."<br>Maybe just:<br>"DSO messages sent with TLS1.3 0-RTT before the TLS handshake is completed or in TCP SYN data with use of TCP Fast Open MUST be idempotent."<br>However, this is actually already required by TLS1.3 and TFO, so there is after all no need to just rephrase this requirement here (at least not normatively). I think it would be more useful for every DSO message type to specify if it can be sent in 0-RTT or not and require this for specification of future TLVs.<br><br>9) sec 5.1.3: "In cases where a DSO session is terminated on one side of a<br>&nbsp;  middlebox, and then some session is opened on the other side of the<br>&nbsp;  middlebox in order to satisfy requests sent over the first DSO<br>&nbsp;  session, any such session MUST be treated as a separate session."<br>This sentence seems a bit non-sensical, which probably isn't great for a normative sentence. If a session is terminated and open of the other end, doesn't that mean that you have two sessions?<br><br>10) sec 5.1.3: "A middlebox that is not doing a strict pass-through will have no way to<br>&nbsp;  know on which connection to forward a DSO message, and therefore will<br>&nbsp;  not be able to behave incorrectly."<br>I'm not sure I understand this sentence. Can you clarify?<br><br>11) As already briefly mentioned by Ben, there is quite some redundant text in sec 5 (with 5.2) for handling of message IDs and TLVs. Given this text is normative, I would really recommend to only specify it clearly once. Please also check the rest of the doc further things that are specified normatively multiple times. It usually makes it must clearer to specify it only once, at least normatively, at the appropriate position in the doc.<br><br>12) sec 5.3.1: "When a DSO unacknowledged message is unsuccessful for some reason, .."<br>What does unsuccessful mean here? Can you clarify?<br><br>13) sec 6.5.2: "A corporate DNS server that knows it is serving only clients on the<br>&nbsp;  internal network, with no intervening NAT gateways or firewalls, can<br>&nbsp;  impose a higher keepalive interval, because frequent keepalive<br>&nbsp;  traffic is not required."<br>I guess in this scenario it is probably most appropriate to not send any keep-alives…<br><br>14) sec 6.6: "&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The server application software terminates unexpectedly (perhaps<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; due to a bug that makes it crash)."<br>This bullet point does not really make sense to me because at that time when the app is crashed there is no way for the server anymore to perform any actions.<br><br>15) sec 7.1: "When a client is sending its second and subsequent Keepalive DSO<br>&nbsp;  requests to the server, the client SHOULD continue to request its<br>&nbsp;  preferred values each time. "<br>I don't understand the SHOULD here.. what else should be client put in these field instead...?<br><br>16) sec 7.1.2: "Once a DSO Session has been established, if either<br>&nbsp;  client or server receives a DNS message over the DSO Session that<br>&nbsp;  contains an EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option, this is a fatal error and<br>&nbsp;  the receiver of the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option MUST forcibly abort<br>&nbsp;  the connection immediately."<br>This is normatively specified multiple time (3?) in the doc. Please consider to only specify it once where most appropriate (probably section 7.1.2)<br><br>16) sec 7.1: "The Keepalive TLV is not used as an Additional TLV."<br>This is redundant with the normative sentence in the next paragraph. Maybe just remove this sentence...?<br><br>17) +1 to Ben's discuss regarding the reconnection of clients. A TCP RST can be sent for many reasons and waiting for an hour seems not appropriate. I would rather recommend to log an error and directly try to reconnect.</div></td>

 The terms "initiator" and "responder" correspond respectively to the<br>&nbsp;  initial sender and subsequent receiver of a DSO request message or<br>&nbsp;  unacknowledged message, regardless of which was the "client" and<br>&nbsp;  "server" in the usual DNS sense.<br><br>We just defined "client" and "server" explictly (without reference to the<br>"usual DNS sense"), so probably it's best to have this definition refer to<br>the previous client/server definitions or clarify that the above<br>definitions match the "usual DNS sense".<br><br>&nbsp;  When an anycast service is configured on a particular IP address and<br>&nbsp;  port, it must be the case that although there is more than one<br>&nbsp;  physical server responding on that IP address, each such server can<br>&nbsp;  be treated as equivalent.&nbsp; If a change in network topology causes<br>&nbsp;  packets in a particular TCP connection to be sent to an anycast<br>&nbsp;  server instance that does not know about the connection, the normal<br>&nbsp;  keepalive and TCP connection timeout process will allow for recovery.<br>&nbsp;  If after the connection is re-established, [...]<br><br>Perhaps clarifying that "recovery" means "detecting the broken session and<br>starting a new one" would be useful?&nbsp;

 ([TBA2] tentatively 11), then the client MUST assume that the server<br>&nbsp;  does not implement DSO at all.&nbsp; In this case the client is permitted<br>&nbsp;  to continue sending DNS messages on that connection, but the client<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD NOT issue further DSO messages on that connection.<br><br>I'm confused how the server would still have proper framing for subsequent<br>DNS messages, since the DSO TLVs would be "spurious extra data" after a<br>request header and potentially subject to misinterpretation as the start of<br>another DNS message header.<br><br>Section 5.1.3<br><br>It is probably worth explicitly noting that a middlebox MUST NOT<br>make/forward a DSO request with TLVs that it does not implement.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;

 where the sender doesn't know if the receiver supports the Primary<br>&nbsp;  TLV in the message, because there is no way to receive any response<br>&nbsp;  to indicate success or failure of the request message (the request<br>&nbsp;

(But maybe then it is only "Some such<br>transports" that can offer persistent sessions.)<br><br>Maybe give some examples of advantages of server-initiated messages?&nbsp; Are<br>we talking about letting the server push records with larger TTLs or<br>notifying when the response to a query is changing, or just more mundane<br>keepalive-type things?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The terms "initiator" and "responder" correspond respectively to the<br>&nbsp;  initial sender and subsequent receiver of a DSO request message or<br>&nbsp;  unacknowledged message, regardless of which was the "client" and<br>&nbsp;  "server" in the usual DNS sense.<br><br>We just defined "client" and "server" explictly (without reference to the<br>"usual DNS sense"), so probably it's best to have this definition refer to<br>the previous client/server definitions or clarify that the above<br>definitions match the "usual DNS sense".<br><br>&nbsp;  When an anycast service is configured on a particular IP address and<br>&nbsp;  port, it must be the case that although there is more than one<br>&nbsp;  physical server responding on that IP address, each such server can<br>&nbsp;  be treated as equivalent.&nbsp; If a change in network topology causes<br>&nbsp;  packets in a particular TCP connection to be sent to an anycast<br>&nbsp;  server instance that does not know about the connection, the normal<br>&nbsp;  keepalive and TCP connection timeout process will allow for recovery.<br>&nbsp;  If after the connection is re-established, [...]<br><br>Perhaps clarifying that "recovery" means "detecting the broken session and<br>starting a new one" would be useful?&nbsp; (I guess Spencer's DISCUSS takes this<br>a different direction.)<br><br>&nbsp;  DSO unacknowledged messages are unidirectional messages and do not<br>&nbsp;  generate any response.<br><br>"Do not generate any response" at the DNS layer; any reason to mention that<br>TCP will still ACK the bytes (or rather, that the "reliable" part of the<br>data stream will need to do so)?<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  DSO messages MUST be carried in only protocols and in environments<br>&nbsp;  where a session may be established according to the definition given<br>&nbsp;  above in the Terminology section (Section 3).<br><br>nit: is this "in only" or "only in"<br><br>&nbsp;  If the RCODE is set to any value other than NOERROR (0) or DSOTYPENI<br>&nbsp;  ([TBA2] tentatively 11), then the client MUST assume that the server<br>&nbsp;  does not implement DSO at all.&nbsp; In this case the client is permitted<br>&nbsp;  to continue sending DNS messages on that connection, but the client<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD NOT issue further DSO messages on that connection.<br><br>I'm confused how the server would still have proper framing for subsequent<br>DNS messages, since the DSO TLVs would be "spurious extra data" after a<br>request header and potentially subject to misinterpretation as the start of<br>another DNS message header.<br><br>Section 5.1.3<br><br>It is probably worth explicitly noting that a middlebox MUST NOT<br>make/forward a DSO request with TLVs that it does not implement.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If a DSO message is received where any of the count fields are not<br>&nbsp;  zero, then a FORMERR MUST be returned, unless a future IETF Standard<br>&nbsp;  specifies otherwise.<br><br>This seems like ... not the conventional wording for this behavior, and<br>subject to large debates about the meaning of "IETF Standard".<br>(Similar language is used elsewhere, too.)<br><br>Section 5.2.2<br><br>The start of this section seems to duplicate a lot of Section 3 -- e.g.,<br>the specification of the "Primary TLV"; request/response/unacknowledged as<br>the types of messages; etc.&nbsp; It's unclear to me that this duplication of<br>content is helpful to the reader.<br><br>&nbsp;  Unacknowledged messages MUST NOT be used "speculatively" in cases<br>&nbsp;  where the sender doesn't know if the receiver supports the Primary<br>&nbsp;  TLV in the message, because there is no way to receive any response<br>&nbsp;  to indicate success or failure of the request message (the request<br>&nbsp;  message does not contain a unique MESSAGE ID with which to associate<br>&nbsp;  a response with its corresponding request).&nbsp; Unacknowledged messages<br>&nbsp;  are only appropriate in cases where the sender already knows that the<br>&nbsp;

I'll stick the Discuss text here for ease of archaeology. <br><br>--- previous Discuss <br><br>I really like this document, and think it's headed the right direction. Of course I have four pages of comments, because reasons, but the only part I'm really confused about is this one ...<br><br>I would have thought that if you end up with a different endpoint because your anycast address now resolves differently, the new endpoint would have to have shared a lot of state with the previous endpoint, for this to work:<br><br>&nbsp; When an anycast service is configured on a particular IP address and<br>&nbsp;  port, it must be the case that although there is more than one<br>&nbsp;  physical server responding on that IP address, each such server can<br>&nbsp;  be treated as equivalent.&nbsp; If a change in network topology causes<br>&nbsp;  packets in a particular TCP connection to be sent to an anycast<br>&nbsp;  server instance that does not know about the connection, the normal<br>&nbsp;  keepalive and TCP connection timeout process will allow for recovery.<br><br>What I would have expected to happen, is that the new endpoint sees a packet arrive that's not on a synchronized TCP connection, and immediately responds with a RST (reset), rather than the normal keepalive and TCP connection timeout process happening. That's also the way I'm reading <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7828#section-3.6">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7828#section-3.6</a>. Is that not the way it's working for anycast these days?<br><br>--- end of previous Discuss<br><br>Everything else is a comment, so non-blocking, and please do the right thing. <br><br>This is a nit, and your answer could be "no", and that's fine, but in some places this document uses "DSO keepalive", and in other places, "keepalive" with no qualifier. It's likely that less confusion would result if you could consistently call this "DSO keepalive", so that it is clearly NOT a TCP keepalive. Do the right thing, of course. <br><br>Is the expectation that DSO would also be used in DNS over HTTP? I'm reading <br><br>&nbsp; At the time of publication, DSO is specified only for DNS over TCP<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc1035/">RFC1035</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc7766/">RFC7766</a>], and for DNS over TLS over TCP [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>].&nbsp; Any<br>&nbsp;  use of DSO over some other connection technology needs to be<br>&nbsp;  specified in an appropriate future document.<br><br>and noticing that <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-12">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-12</a> is currently in IETF Last Call.<br><br>This next one is well within the "Spencer wouldn't have done it this way, but Spencer's not the working group, or the IETF" range, but <br><br>&nbsp; However, in the typical case a server will not know in advance<br>&nbsp;  whether a client supports DSO, so in general, unless it is known in<br>&nbsp;  advance by other means that a client does support DSO, a server MUST<br>&nbsp;  NOT initiate DSO request messages or DSO unacknowledged messages<br>&nbsp;  until a DSO Session has been mutually established by at least one<br>&nbsp;  successful DSO request/response exchange initiated by the client, as<br>&nbsp;  described below.&nbsp; Similarly, unless it is known in advance by other<br>&nbsp;  means that a server does support DSO, a client MUST NOT initiate DSO<br>&nbsp;  unacknowledged messages until after a DSO Session has been mutually<br>&nbsp;  established.<br><br>seems fragile, especially in environments where clients can come and go, and servers may be addressed using anycast (so I knew in advance that the four servers at that anycast address supported DSO, but somebody installed a fifth server that does not). Is that unlikely to be a problem?<br><br>I'm sure <br><br>&nbsp; A single server may support multiple services, including DNS Updates<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a>], DNS Push Notifications [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dnssd-push/">I-D.ietf-dnssd-push</a>], and other<br>&nbsp;  services, for one or more DNS zones.&nbsp; When a client discovers that<br>&nbsp;  the target server for several different operations is the same target<br>&nbsp;  hostname and port, the client SHOULD use a single shared DSO Session<br>&nbsp;  for all those operations.&nbsp; A client SHOULD NOT open multiple<br>&nbsp;  connections to the same target host and port just because the names<br>&nbsp;  being operated on are different or happen to fall within different<br>&nbsp;  zones.&nbsp; This requirement is to reduce unnecessary connection load on<br>&nbsp;  the DNS server.<br><br>is correct from the server side, but perhaps it's also worth noting that using multiple TCP connections unnecessarily increases the chances that data transfers happen during TCP slow start. If only one or two packets are being exchanged, that doesn't matter, but as more packets are exchanged, the difference increases, because congestion windows will grow more rapidly if fewer connections are used. <br><br>I appreciate the inclusion of 5.4.&nbsp; DSO Response Generation<br><br>But I've gotta ask. In the last paragraph of that section, I see <br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Use a networking API that lets the receiver signal to the TCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implementation that the receiver has received and processed a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; client request for which it will not be generating any immediate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; response.&nbsp; This allows the TCP implementation to operate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; efficiently in both cases; for requests that generate a response,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the TCP ACK, window update, and DSO response are transmitted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; together in a single TCP segment, and for requests that do not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generate a response, the application-layer software informs the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TCP implementation that it should go ahead and send the TCP ACK<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and window update immediately, without waiting for the Delayed ACK<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; timer.&nbsp; Unfortunately it is not known at this time which (if any)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the widely-available networking APIs currently include this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; capability.<br><br>I would love to know if there are any widely-available network APIs that include this capability, before including this text in a standards-track RFC. Do you need help chasing this down?<br><br>The text in 6.1.&nbsp; DSO Session Initiation seems rough to me, for a couple of reasons. <br><br>&nbsp;  The client may perform as many DNS operations as it wishes using the<br>&nbsp;  newly created DSO Session.&nbsp; Operations SHOULD be pipelined (i.e., the<br><br>I don't understand why this would be a SHOULD. At least from the client's perspective, it's not needed for interoperation. <br><br>&nbsp;  client doesn't need wait for a response before sending the next<br>&nbsp;  message).&nbsp; The server MUST act on messages in the order they are<br>&nbsp;  transmitted, but responses to those messages SHOULD be sent out of<br>&nbsp;  order when appropriate.<br><br>Is it correct to say that "responses to those messages SHOULD be sent when they become available, even if the responses are sent out of order"? If not, I'm probably missing what "when appropriate" means.<br><br>I'm a bit mystified by this text in 6.2.&nbsp; DSO Session Timeouts<br><br>&nbsp; In the usual case where the inactivity timeout is shorter than the<br>&nbsp;  keepalive interval, it is only when a client has a very long-lived,<br>&nbsp;  low-traffic, operation that the keepalive interval comes into play,<br>&nbsp;  to ensure that a sufficient residual amount of traffic is generated<br>&nbsp;  to maintain NAT and firewall state and to assure client and server<br>&nbsp;  that they still have connectivity to each other.<br><br>I think the basics are correct - the inactivity timer and (DSO) keepalive interval are independent - but I'm struggling to think of a reason to send (DSO) keepalives that's NOT tied to maintaining NAT/firewall state, and there's a lot of text before the paragraph that mentions NAT/firewall, that talks about why either interval might be longer or shorter than the other, without considering NAT/firewall. Am I missing something here? <br><br>... and, now that I keep reading, 6.5.2.&nbsp; Values for the Keepalive Interval<br>does a much better job of explaining how a (DSO) keepalive interval should be selected - I think you could reasonably delete most of the text about (DSO) keepalive intervals in section 6.2, and at most provide a forward pointer to 6.5.2. <br><br>(As an aside, I think you probably want to cite <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp142">https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp142</a> as the operative recommendation for NAT behaviour toward TCP, since <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382</a> has been updated)<br><br>I found this text <br><br>&nbsp; For long-lived DNS Stateful operations (such as a Push Notification<br>&nbsp;  subscription [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dnssd-push/">I-D.ietf-dnssd-push</a>] or a Discovery Relay interface<br>&nbsp;  subscription [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay/">I-D.ietf-dnssd-mdns-relay</a>]), an operation is considered<br>&nbsp;  in progress for as long as the operation is active, until it is<br>&nbsp;  cancelled.&nbsp; This means that a DSO Session can exist, with active<br>&nbsp;  operations, with no messages flowing in either direction, for far<br>&nbsp;  longer than the inactivity timeout, and this is not an error.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  is why there are two separate timers: the inactivity timeout, and the<br>&nbsp;  keepalive interval.&nbsp; Just because a DSO Session has no traffic for an<br>&nbsp;  extended period of time does not automatically make that DSO Session<br>&nbsp;  "inactive", if it has an active operation that is awaiting events.<br><br>to be extremely helpful, but it's 28 pages into the document. Is there a place earlier in the document that describes these timers, where you could place this text? Maybe section 3/Terminology isn't the right place, but maybe there is a right place toward the front of the document. <br><br>I'm not understanding why the SHOULDs are not MUSTs in this text:<br><br>&nbsp; If, at any time during the life of the DSO Session, twice the<br>&nbsp;  inactivity timeout value (i.e., 30 seconds by default), or five<br>&nbsp;  seconds, if twice the inactivity timeout value is less than five<br>&nbsp;  seconds, elapses without there being any operation active on the DSO<br>&nbsp;  Session, the server SHOULD consider the client delinquent, and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  forcibly abort the DSO Session.<br><br>Perhaps part of my confusion is that I'm not sure what it means to "consider the client delinquent", but NOT to "forcibly abort the DSO session". But there are several "will forcibly abort"s in section 6.4.2, that sound more like MUST than SHOULD.<br><br>I don't think the MUST NOT in <br><br>&nbsp; Normally a server MUST NOT close a DSO Session with a client.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  server only causes a DSO Session to be ended in the exceptional<br>&nbsp;  circumstances outlined below. <br><br>is quite right. Given that you have a bulleted list of reasons why a server would violate the MUST not immediately following this sentence, you might want to say "Normally a server does not close" here.</div></td>

I understand the desire to optimize for the case where the application knows that no data will be sent as reply to a certain message, however, TCP does not have a notion of message boundaries and therefore cannot and should not act based on the reception of a certain message. Indicating to the TCP that an ACK can be set immediately in an specific situation is also problematic as ACK processing is part of the TCP's internal machinery. However, why it is important at all that an TCP-level ACK is send out fast than the delayed ACK timer? The ACK receiver does not expose the information when an ACK is received to the application and the delayed ACK timer only expires if no further data is received/send by the ACK-receiver, therefore this optimization should not have any impact in the application performance. I would just recommend to remove this section and any additional discussion about delayed ACKs.<br><br>Please note that the problem described in [NagleDA] only occurs for request-response protocols where no further request can be sent before the response is received. This is not the case in this protocol (as pipelining is supported).<br><br>2) Further regarding keep-alives:<br>in sec 6.5.2: "For example, a hypothetical keepalive interval<br>&nbsp;  value of 100ms would result in a continuous stream of at least ten<br>&nbsp;  messages per second, in both directions, to keep the DSO Session<br>&nbsp;  alive."<br>This does not seems correct. There should be at max one keep-alives message in flight. Thus the keep-laives timer should only be restarted after the keep-alive reply was received. <br>Also:<br>"And, in this extreme example, a single packet loss and<br>&nbsp;  retransmission over a long path could introduce a momentary pause in<br>&nbsp;  the stream of messages, long enough to cause the server to<br>&nbsp;  overzealously abort the connection."<br>This doesn't really make sense to me: As I said, TCP will retransmit and the keep-alive timer should not be running until the reply is received. If you want to abort the connection based on keep-alives quickly before the TCP connection indicates you a failure, you need to wait at minimum for an interval that is larger than the TCP RTO (with is uaually 3 RTTs) which means you basically need to know the RTT.<br><br>Also sec 7.1: "If the client does not generate the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mandated keepalive traffic, then after twice this interval the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server will forcibly abort the connection."<br>Why must the server terminate the connection at all if the client refuses to send keep-alives? Isn't that what the inactivity timer is meant for? Usually only the endpoint that initiates the keep-alive should terminate the connection if no response is received.<br><br>3) There is another contraction regarding the inactive timer:<br>Sec 6.2 say "A shorter inactivity timeout with a longer keepalive interval signals<br>&nbsp;  to the client that it should not speculatively keep an inactive DSO<br>&nbsp;  Session open for very long without reason, but when it does have an<br>&nbsp;  active reason to keep a DSO Session open, it doesn't need to be<br>&nbsp;  sending an aggressive level of keepalive traffic to maintain that<br>&nbsp;  session."<br>which indicates that the client may leave the session open longer than indicated by the inactive timer of the server.<br>However section 7.1.1 say that the client MUST close the connection when the timer is expired.</div></td>

Maybe move those paragraphs somewhere else...? Also the part about "long-lived operations" and messages types provides far more information than just terminology and I would recommend to also move it into an own section or maybe just have it as part of the intro.<br><br>2) Maybe call section 5 "Protocol specification" instead of "Protocol details"...?<br><br>3) Sec 5.1: "DSO messages MUST be carried in only protocols and in environments<br>&nbsp;  where a session may be established according to the definition given<br>&nbsp;  above in the Terminology section (Section 3)."<br>I don't get this. Which part of section 3? Given section 3 is on terminology and this is a normative statement, I would recommend to spell out here explicitly what is meant. Do you mean the protocol must be connection-oriented, reliable, and providing in-order delivery? Any thing else? However, given that you say two paragraphs onwards that this spec is only applicable for the use with TCP and TLS/TCP, do you even need to specify these requirements normatively? <br><br>4) sec 5.1 "It is a common<br>&nbsp;  convention that protocols specified to run over TLS are given IANA<br>&nbsp;  service type names ending in "-tls"."<br>Not sure this is true. Isn't it usually just an "s" at the end? Or with registry are you talking about?<br><br>5) sec 5.1: "In some environments it may be known in advance by external means<br>&nbsp;  that both client and server support DSO, ..."<br>I guess the client and server also need to know if TLS is supported or not. Maybe spell this out as well.<br><br>6) sec 5.1: "... therefore either<br>&nbsp;  client or server may be the initiator of a message."<br>Maybe s/initiator of a message/initiator of a message exchange/<br><br>7) sec 5.1.2: "Having initiated a connection to a server, possibly using zero round-<br>&nbsp;  trip TCP Fast Open and/or zero round-trip TLS 1.3, a client MAY send<br>&nbsp;  multiple response-requiring DSO request messages to the server in<br>&nbsp;  succession without having to wait for a response to the first request<br>&nbsp;  message to confirm successful establishment of a DSO session."<br>Why is the ability to send more than one request related to TCP Fast Open/TLS1.3 0-RTT? These are two independent mechanisms to speed up processing. Mentioning TCP Fast Open/TLS1.3 0-RTT here is rather confusing. Respectively I also don't think that the sentence:<br>"Similarly, DSO supports zero round-trip operation." is describing quite the same.<br> <br>8) Further please provide references to TCP Fast Open and TLS1.3 and maybe rephrase this paragraph to use normative language:<br>"Caution must be taken to ensure that DSO messages sent before the<br>&nbsp;  first round-trip is completed are idempotent, or are otherwise immune<br>&nbsp;  to any problems that could be result from the inadvertent replay that<br>&nbsp;  can occur with zero round-trip operation."<br>Maybe just:<br>"DSO messages sent with TLS1.3 0-RTT before the TLS handshake is completed or in TCP SYN data with use of TCP Fast Open MUST be idempotent."<br>However, this is actually already required by TLS1.3 and TFO, so there is after all no need to just rephrase this requirement here (at least not normatively). I think it would be more useful for every DSO message type to specify if it can be sent in 0-RTT or not and require this for specification of future TLVs.<br><br>9) sec 5.1.3: "In cases where a DSO session is terminated on one side of a<br>&nbsp;  middlebox, and then some session is opened on the other side of the<br>&nbsp;  middlebox in order to satisfy requests sent over the first DSO<br>&nbsp;  session, any such session MUST be treated as a separate session."<br>This sentence seems a bit non-sensical, which probably isn't great for a normative sentence. If a session is terminated and open of the other end, doesn't that mean that you have two sessions?<br><br>10) sec 5.1.3: "A middlebox that is not doing a strict pass-through will have no way to<br>&nbsp;  know on which connection to forward a DSO message, and therefore will<br>&nbsp;  not be able to behave incorrectly."<br>I'm not sure I understand this sentence. Can you clarify?<br><br>11) As already briefly mentioned by Ben, there is quite some redundant text in sec 5 (with 5.2) for handling of message IDs and TLVs. Given this text is normative, I would really recommend to only specify it clearly once. Please also check the rest of the doc further things that are specified normatively multiple times. It usually makes it must clearer to specify it only once, at least normatively, at the appropriate position in the doc.<br><br>12) sec 5.3.1: "When a DSO unacknowledged message is unsuccessful for some reason, .."<br>What does unsuccessful mean here? Can you clarify?<br><br>13) sec 6.5.2: "A corporate DNS server that knows it is serving only clients on the<br>&nbsp;  internal network, with no intervening NAT gateways or firewalls, can<br>&nbsp;  impose a higher keepalive interval, because frequent keepalive<br>&nbsp;  traffic is not required."<br>I guess in this scenario it is probably most appropriate to not send any keep-alives…<br><br>14) sec 6.6: "&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The server application software terminates unexpectedly (perhaps<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; due to a bug that makes it crash)."<br>This bullet point does not really make sense to me because at that time when the app is crashed there is no way for the server anymore to perform any actions.<br><br>15) sec 7.1: "When a client is sending its second and subsequent Keepalive DSO<br>&nbsp;  requests to the server, the client SHOULD continue to request its<br>&nbsp;  preferred values each time. "<br>I don't understand the SHOULD here.. what else should be client put in these field instead...?<br><br>16) sec 7.1.2: "Once a DSO Session has been established, if either<br>&nbsp;  client or server receives a DNS message over the DSO Session that<br>&nbsp;  contains an EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option, this is a fatal error and<br>&nbsp;  the receiver of the EDNS(0) TCP Keepalive option MUST forcibly abort<br>&nbsp;  the connection immediately."<br>This is normatively specified multiple time (3?) in the doc. Please consider to only specify it once where most appropriate (probably section 7.1.2)<br><br>16) sec 7.1: "The Keepalive TLV is not used as an Additional TLV."<br>This is redundant with the normative sentence in the next paragraph. Maybe just remove this sentence...?<br><br>17) +1 to Ben's discuss regarding the reconnection of clients. A TCP RST can be sent for many reasons and waiting for an hour seems not appropriate. I would rather recommend to log an error and directly try to reconnect.</div></td>

I understand the desire to optmize for the case where the application knows that no data will be sent as reply to a certain message. However, TCP does not have a notion of message boundaries and therfore cannot and should not act based on the reception of a certain message. Indicating to the TCP that an ACK can be set immediately in an specfic situation is also problematic as ACK processing is part of the TCP's internal machinery. However, why it is important at all that an TCP-level ACK is send out fast than the delayed ACK timer? The ACK receiver does not expose the information when an ACK is received to the application and the delayed ACK timer only expires if no further data is received/send by the ACK-receiver, therefore this optimization should not have any impact in the application performance. I would just recomend to remove this section and any additional discussion about delayed ACKs.<br><br>Please note that the problem described in [NagleDA] only occurs for request-repsonse protocols where not further request can be sent before the response is received. This is not the case in this protocol.<br><br>2) Furthe regarding keep-alives in sec 6.5.2: "For example, a hypothetical keepalive interval<br>&nbsp;  value of 100ms would result in a continuous stream of at least ten<br>&nbsp;  messages per second, in both directions, to keep the DSO Session<br>&nbsp;  alive."<br>This does not seems correct. There should be at max one keep-a-lives message in flight. Thus the keep-lives timer should be restarted when the keep-alive reply was receiced. <br>Also:<br>"And, in this extreme example, a single packet loss and<br>&nbsp;  retransmission over a long path could introduce a momentary pause in<br>&nbsp;  the stream of messages, long enough to cause the server to<br>&nbsp;  overzealously abort the connection."<br>This doesn't really make sense to me: As I said, TCP will retransmit and the keep-alives timer should not be running until the reply is receiced. if you want to abort the connection based on keep-alives quickly before the TCP connection indicates you a failure, you need to wait at minimum for an interval that is larger than the TCP RTO (with is uaually 3 RTTs).</div></td>

These DSO messages communicate with persistent <br>stateful DNS sessions. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The Working Group spent an inordinate amount of time on this document, as<br>there was some concern that this was attempting to extend the reach of<br>DNS beyond the scope of the working group.&nbsp; However, after several iterations,<br>the working group came to consensus on the document, and strong consensus to <br>move forward.<br><br>Document Quality: <br><br>There are currently no existing implementations of the protocol.
