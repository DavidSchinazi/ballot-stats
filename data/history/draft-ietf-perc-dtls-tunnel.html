SDP sessions that describe the expected DTLS<br>session construction (and the media to be carried over DTLS-SRTP).&nbsp; It<br>seems that in the general case, a given Key Distributor will be engaged<br>in many active and pending sessions, and thus will need to be able to<br>look up across many clients and sessions which SDP state might be a<br>match for a given DTLS ClientHello, while avoiding DoS attacks and not<br>committing any given SDP session to a DTLS association prior to the<br>completion of the DTLS handshake.&nbsp; My preference would be to see a lot<br>more discussion in the document about this type of considerations,<br>though for an Informational protocol I won't insist on it (this is a<br>non-blocking comment).<br><br>With the media distributor acting as an intermediary that is partially<br>trusted, the situation is more complicated than usual, and the key<br>distributor cannot use transport coordinates to identify DTLS<br>associations, and instead the only index available is the UUID assigned<br>by the media distributor.&nbsp; To some extent we rely on the media<br>distributor to properly map DTLS packets to the UUID identifier, but<br>AFAICT if the media distributor fails to do so, the DTLS cryptographic<br>mechanisms will detect such errors and either abort the handshake or<br>(post-handshake) reject invalid messages.&nbsp; It might be worth reiterating<br>that DTLS does provide this form of protection.<br><br>Since the UUID is the only index that the key distributor has for DTLS<br>associations, there does not seem to be any risk of having the media<br>distributor trick the key distributor into releasing HBH keys from the<br>"wrong" association -- keys should only be released if the DTLS<br>handshake will complete successfully (but see the Discuss point #1!),<br>and the completion of the handshake authenticates the overall exchange<br>so that it's safe to release keys via the channel that identifies the<br>handshake (i.e., the UUID).&nbsp; There does seem to only be very<br>coarsed-grained "trusted or not" authorization for media servers to<br>receive keys at all, though -- a malicious-but-trusted media distributor<br>that had on-path access for some other DTLS flows could relay them to<br>the key distributor and have the DTLS handshake succeed along that path,<br>even if it was not the intended path, and would get the HBH keys as a<br>result.<br><br>Does it only make sense to use this tunneling protocol with a "DOUBLE"<br>DTLS-SRTP profile?&nbsp; If so, that might be worth mentioning somewhere more<br>explicitly.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor is a logical function that might be co-resident<br>&nbsp;  with a key management server operated by an enterprise, reside in one<br>&nbsp;  of the endpoints participating in the conference, or elsewhere that<br>&nbsp;  is trusted with E2E keying material.<br><br>Do we want to say something about the Key Distributor acting at a higher<br>level of trust than the Media Distributor?&nbsp; (Is that even always true?)<br><br>Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 seems to show the MediaKeys being delivered to the Media<br>Distributor after only a single message from the Endpoint (i.e., prior<br>to the completion of the DTLS handshake).&nbsp; I don't think that is<br>accurate, and it seems like that arrow should be moved later in the time<br>sequence.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  When processing an incoming endpoint association, the Key Distributor<br>&nbsp;  MUST extract the "external_session_id" value transmitted in the<br>&nbsp;  "ClientHello" message and match that against "tls-id" value the<br>&nbsp;  endpoint transmitted via SDP.&nbsp; If the values in SDP and the<br>&nbsp;  "ClientHello" do not match, the DTLS association MUST be rejected.<br><br>The Key Distributor might have multiple pending associations, and<br>potentially only weak bindings to endpoint identities prior to DTLS<br>establishment, so it's not clear that "match [external_session_id]<br>against 'tls-id' value the endpoint transmitted via SDP" is entirely<br>accurate.&nbsp; I'm implicitly inserting a "the" before "tls-id" to make it<br>parse, but the implicit "the" is not a good fit since the definite<br>article implies there is a single one identified but there may be<br>multiple pending associations.&nbsp; AFAICT at this point in processing the<br>only real identifier that the key distributor has for the pending DTLS<br>association is the UUID from the media distributor and there is no tight<br>association betwen that identifier and the "tld-id" value that (per the<br>following paragraph) is conveyed to the key distributor in some<br>unspecified manner.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST match the certificate fingerprint and<br>&nbsp;  "external_session_id" received from endpoint's "ClientHello" message<br>&nbsp;  with the values received from the SDP transmitted by the endpoint.<br><br>This sentence is rather confusing to me, since I don't know of a<br>certificate fingerprint conveyed in the ClientHello itself (as opposed<br>to the fingerprint of the certificate contained in the Certificate<br>message presented during the handshake).<br><br>&nbsp;  It is through this process that the Key Distributor can be sure to<br>&nbsp;  deliver the correct conference key to the endpoint.<br><br>Do we need to say anything about how the Key Distributor gets the<br>fingerprint and external_session_id values from SDP?&nbsp; (I mean, I assume<br>that it's the same way that it gets the "tls-id", but the previous<br>paragraph just talked about "tls-id" and not the other stuff, so<br>formally it's ambiguous.)<br><br>&nbsp;  When sending the "ServerHello" message, the Key Distributor MUST<br>&nbsp;  insert its own unique identifier in the "external_session_id"<br>&nbsp;  extension.&nbsp; This value MUST also be conveyed back to the client via<br>&nbsp;  SDP as a "tls-id" attribute.<br><br>It's not really clear that the binding between the endpoint that is<br>supposedly presenting the DTLS data and the SDP data has been<br>established at all here, so the selection of what "tls-id" to use here<br>feels rather speculative.&nbsp; I think we should discuss the security<br>considerations for what is leaked if the key distributor sends the<br>"wrong" values here...<br><br>I'm also not sure if the sequencing of events is properly described<br>here.&nbsp; Does the SDP need to complete before the DTLS handshake begins,<br>or can they proceed in parallel as described here?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 section 4.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think that §3 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> is probably a better reference for TLS<br>presentation language at this point.<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>I'm not sure what purpose sending an empty dtls_message would serve.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "dtls_message": the content of the DTLS message received by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endpoint or to be sent to the endpoint.<br><br>I recommend saying something about "including record-layer framing" to<br>reiterate where the boundary is.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>I strongly recommend upgrading the TLS version between media distributor<br>and key distributor to be TLS 1.3.&nbsp; Whether or not to use DTLS 1.2 or<br>1.3 for the tunneled traffic between endpoint and key distributor is an<br>orthogonal topic.<br><br>I'd also reiterate that the media distributor has access to metadata<br>about the endpoint/key distributor communications, even though the main<br>content and key information is encrypted.<br><br>I'd also consider calling out that the media distributor could generate<br>false EndpointDisconnect messages, but that this is essentially the same<br>capability afforded by just not forwarding media anymore.<br><br>&nbsp;  A requirement in this document is that a TLS connection between the<br>&nbsp;  Media Distributor and the Key Distributor be mutually authenticated.<br>&nbsp;  The reason for this requirement is to ensure that only an authorized<br>&nbsp;  Media Distributor receives the HBH keying material.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Can we say anything about what the Key Distributor's authorization<br>policy might be, using the authenticated identity of the TLS peer as<br>input?&nbsp; "Any authenticated identity is granted all access" is not a<br>great authorization policy :)<br><br>NITS<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia<br><br>I think the hyphenated "DTLS-tunneling" would clarify that DTLS is being<br>tunneled (as opposed to the mechanism used to tunnel other things).<br>A slightly more intrusive change would be "protocol for tunneling DTLS<br>traffic" but that might be confusing in the terse setting of the<br>Abstract.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  By establishing this TLS tunnel between the Media Distributor and Key<br>&nbsp;  Distributor and implementing the protocol defined in this document,<br>&nbsp;  it is possible for the Media Distributor to facilitate the<br>&nbsp;  establishment of a secure DTLS association between an endpoint and<br>&nbsp;  the Key Distributor in order for the endpoint to receive E2E and HBH<br>&nbsp;  keying material.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think "receive" might not be the best word here, since the key<br>material should incorporate contributions from both parties; the "arrive<br>at" language used in the previous paragraph was good.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  As DTLS messages are received from the endpoint by the Media<br>&nbsp;  Distributor, they are forwarded to the Key Distributor encapsulated<br>&nbsp;  inside a "TunneledDtls" message.&nbsp; Likewise, as "TunneledDtls"<br>&nbsp;  messages are received by the Media Distributor from the Mey<br>&nbsp;  Distributor, the encapsulated DTLS packet is forwarded to the<br>&nbsp;  endpoint.<br><br>s/Mey/Key/<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The endpoint MUST include a unique identifier in the "tls-id" SDP<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4566/">RFC4566</a>] attribute sent by the endpoint in both offer and answer<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc3264/">RFC3264</a>] messages as per [<a href="/doc/rfc8842/">RFC8842</a>].&nbsp; Further, the endpoint MUST<br>&nbsp;  include this same unique identifier in the "external_session_id"<br>&nbsp;  extension [<a href="/doc/rfc8844/">RFC8844</a>] in the "ClientHello" message when establishing a<br>&nbsp;  DTLS association.<br><br>Since this is the section about the endpoint procedures (the key<br>distributor's behavior is discussed later), I think we might avoid<br>phrasing that implies a linked offer/answer pair, and instead say<br>something like "in all offer and answer messages that it generates".<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST encapsulate any DTLS message it sends to an<br>&nbsp;  endpoint inside a "TunneledDtls" message (see Section 6).&nbsp; The Key<br>&nbsp;  Distributor is not required to transmit all messages a given DTLS<br>&nbsp;  association through the same tunnel if more than one tunnel has been<br>&nbsp;  established between it and a Media Distributor.<br><br>I suggest "a given Media Distributor", since the current phrasing seems<br>to allow sending to a different media distributor entirely, which seems<br>unlikely to work since the UUID identifying the DTLS association will<br>not be recognized there.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST select a cipher that is supported by both<br>&nbsp;  the endpoint and the Media Distributor to ensure proper HBH<br>&nbsp;  operations.<br><br>(It also has to pick a cipher that it itself supports...)<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  "UnsupportedVersion".&nbsp; The Media Distributor can determine from the<br>&nbsp;  first two octets received what the version number is and that the<br>&nbsp;  message is "UnsupportedVersion".&nbsp; The rest of the data received, if<br><br>I think that the "two" should be either "one" or "four", as the actual<br>message structure has two octets of length between the message type and<br>the unsupported_version structure.&nbsp; One octet is needed to determine<br>that it is an unsupported-version message, and four to determine the<br>highest supported version number.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  struct {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  uint8 version;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SRTPProtectionProfile protection_profiles&lt;0..2^16-1&gt;;<br>&nbsp;  } SupportedProfiles;<br><br>The presentation language allows an empty list of profiles; is that<br>intended to be allowed?&nbsp; (What happens if an empty list is sent?)<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "version": indicates the version of the protocol to use (0x00).<br><br>I suggest "this document specifies version 0x00" rather than the<br>parenthetical.</div></td>

SDP sessions that describe the expected DTLS<br>session construction (and the media to be carried over DTLS-SRTP).&nbsp; It<br>seems that in the general case, a given Key Distributor will be engaged<br>in many active and pending sessions, and thus will need to be able to<br>look up across many clients and sessions which SDP state might be a<br>match for a given DTLS ClientHello, while avoiding DoS attacks and not<br>committing any given SDP session to a DTLS association prior to the<br>completion of the DTLS handshake.&nbsp; My preference would be to see a lot<br>more discussion in the document about this type of considerations,<br>though for an Informational protocol I won't insist on it (this is a<br>non-blocking comment).<br><br>With the media distributor acting as an intermediary that is partially<br>trusted, the situation is more complicated than usual, and the key<br>distributor cannot use transport coordinates to identify DTLS<br>associations, and instead the only index available is the UUID assigned<br>by the media distributor.&nbsp; To some extent we rely on the media<br>distributor to properly map DTLS packets to the UUID identifier, but<br>AFAICT if the media distributor fails to do so, the DTLS cryptographic<br>mechanisms will detect such errors and either abort the handshake or<br>(post-handshake) reject invalid messages.&nbsp; It might be worth reiterating<br>that DTLS does provide this form of protection.<br><br>Since the UUID is the only index that the key distributor has for DTLS<br>associations, there does not seem to be any risk of having the media<br>distributor trick the key distributor into releasing HBH keys from the<br>"wrong" association -- keys should only be released if the DTLS<br>handshake will complete successfully (but see the Discuss point #1!),<br>and the completion of the handshake authenticates the overall exchange<br>so that it's safe to release keys via the channel that identifies the<br>handshake (i.e., the UUID).&nbsp; There does seem to only be very<br>coarsed-grained "trusted or not" authorization for media servers to<br>receive keys at all, though -- a malicious-but-trusted media distributor<br>that had on-path access for some other DTLS flows could relay them to<br>the key distributor and have the DTLS handshake succeed along that path,<br>even if it was not the intended path, and would get the HBH keys as a<br>result.<br><br>Does it only make sense to use this tunneling protocol with a "DOUBLE"<br>DTLS-SRTP profile?&nbsp; If so, that might be worth mentioning somewhere more<br>explicitly.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor is a logical function that might be co-resident<br>&nbsp;  with a key management server operated by an enterprise, reside in one<br>&nbsp;  of the endpoints participating in the conference, or elsewhere that<br>&nbsp;  is trusted with E2E keying material.<br><br>Do we want to say something about the Key Distributor acting at a higher<br>level of trust than the Media Distributor?&nbsp; (Is that even always true?)<br><br>Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 seems to show the MediaKeys being delivered to the Media<br>Distributor after only a single message from the Endpoint (i.e., prior<br>to the completion of the DTLS handshake).&nbsp; I don't think that is<br>accurate, and it seems like that arrow should be moved later in the time<br>sequence.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  When processing an incoming endpoint association, the Key Distributor<br>&nbsp;  MUST extract the "external_session_id" value transmitted in the<br>&nbsp;  "ClientHello" message and match that against "tls-id" value the<br>&nbsp;  endpoint transmitted via SDP.&nbsp; If the values in SDP and the<br>&nbsp;  "ClientHello" do not match, the DTLS association MUST be rejected.<br><br>The Key Distributor might have multiple pending associations, and<br>potentially only weak bindings to endpoint identities prior to DTLS<br>establishment, so it's not clear that "match [external_session_id]<br>against 'tls-id' value the endpoint transmitted via SDP" is entirely<br>accurate.&nbsp; I'm implicitly inserting a "the" before "tls-id" to make it<br>parse, but the implicit "the" is not a good fit since the definite<br>article implies there is a single one identified but there may be<br>multiple pending associations.&nbsp; AFAICT at this point in processing the<br>only real identifier that the key distributor has for the pending DTLS<br>association is the UUID from the media distributor and there is no tight<br>association betwen that identifier and the "tld-id" value that (per the<br>following paragraph) is conveyed to the key distributor in some<br>unspecified manner.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST match the certificate fingerprint and<br>&nbsp;  "external_session_id" received from endpoint's "ClientHello" message<br>&nbsp;  with the values received from the SDP transmitted by the endpoint.<br><br>This sentence is rather confusing to me, since I don't know of a<br>certificate fingerprint conveyed in the ClientHello itself (as opposed<br>to the fingerprint of the certificate contained in the Certificate<br>message presented during the handshake).<br><br>&nbsp;  It is through this process that the Key Distributor can be sure to<br>&nbsp;  deliver the correct conference key to the endpoint.<br><br>Do we need to say anything about how the Key Distributor gets the<br>fingerprint and external_session_id values from SDP?&nbsp; (I mean, I assume<br>that it's the same way that it gets the "tls-id", but the previous<br>paragraph just talked about "tls-id" and not the other stuff, so<br>formally it's ambiguous.)<br><br>&nbsp;  When sending the "ServerHello" message, the Key Distributor MUST<br>&nbsp;  insert its own unique identifier in the "external_session_id"<br>&nbsp;  extension.&nbsp; This value MUST also be conveyed back to the client via<br>&nbsp;  SDP as a "tls-id" attribute.<br><br>It's not really clear that the binding between the endpoint that is<br>supposedly presenting the DTLS data and the SDP data has been<br>established at all here, so the selection of what "tls-id" to use here<br>feels rather speculative.&nbsp; I think we should discuss the security<br>considerations for what is leaked if the key distributor sends the<br>"wrong" values here...<br><br>I'm also not sure if the sequencing of events is properly described<br>here.&nbsp; Does the SDP need to complete before the DTLS handshake begins,<br>or can they proceed in parallel as described here?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  messages are specified using the format described in [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>]<br>&nbsp;  section 4.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think that §3 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> is probably a better reference for TLS<br>presentation language at this point.<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>I'm not sure what purpose sending an empty dtls_message would serve.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "dtls_message": the content of the DTLS message received by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endpoint or to be sent to the endpoint.<br><br>I recommend saying something about "including record-layer framing" to<br>reiterate where the boundary is.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>I strongly recommend upgrading the TLS version between media distributor<br>and key distributor to be TLS 1.3.&nbsp; Whether or not to use DTLS 1.2 or<br>1.3 for the tunneled traffic between endpoint and key distributor is an<br>orthogonal topic.<br><br>I'd also reiterate that the media distributor has access to metadata<br>about the endpoint/key distributor communications, even though the main<br>content and key information is encrypted.<br><br>I'd also consider calling out that the media distributor could generate<br>false EndpointDisconnect messages, but that this is essentially the same<br>capability afforded by just not forwarding media anymore.<br><br>&nbsp;  A requirement in this document is that a TLS connection between the<br>&nbsp;  Media Distributor and the Key Distributor be mutually authenticated.<br>&nbsp;  The reason for this requirement is to ensure that only an authorized<br>&nbsp;  Media Distributor receives the HBH keying material.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Can we say anything about what the Key Distributor's authorization<br>policy might be, using the authenticated identity of the TLS peer as<br>input?&nbsp; "Any authenticated identity is granted all access" is not a<br>great authorization policy :)<br><br>NITS<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia<br><br>I think the hyphenated "DTLS-tunneling" would clarify that DTLS is being<br>tunneled (as opposed to the mechanism used to tunnel other things).<br>A slightly more intrusive change would be "protocol for tunneling DTLS<br>traffic" but that might be confusing in the terse setting of the<br>Abstract.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  By establishing this TLS tunnel between the Media Distributor and Key<br>&nbsp;  Distributor and implementing the protocol defined in this document,<br>&nbsp;  it is possible for the Media Distributor to facilitate the<br>&nbsp;  establishment of a secure DTLS association between an endpoint and<br>&nbsp;  the Key Distributor in order for the endpoint to receive E2E and HBH<br>&nbsp;  keying material.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think "receive" might not be the best word here, since the key<br>material should incorporate contributions from both parties; the "arrive<br>at" language used in the previous paragraph was good.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  As DTLS messages are received from the endpoint by the Media<br>&nbsp;  Distributor, they are forwarded to the Key Distributor encapsulated<br>&nbsp;  inside a "TunneledDtls" message.&nbsp; Likewise, as "TunneledDtls"<br>&nbsp;  messages are received by the Media Distributor from the Mey<br>&nbsp;  Distributor, the encapsulated DTLS packet is forwarded to the<br>&nbsp;  endpoint.<br><br>s/Mey/Key/<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The endpoint MUST include a unique identifier in the "tls-id" SDP<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4566/">RFC4566</a>] attribute sent by the endpoint in both offer and answer<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc3264/">RFC3264</a>] messages as per [<a href="/doc/rfc8842/">RFC8842</a>].&nbsp; Further, the endpoint MUST<br>&nbsp;  include this same unique identifier in the "external_session_id"<br>&nbsp;  extension [<a href="/doc/rfc8844/">RFC8844</a>] in the "ClientHello" message when establishing a<br>&nbsp;  DTLS association.<br><br>Since this is the section about the endpoint procedures (the key<br>distributor's behavior is discussed later), I think we might avoid<br>phrasing that implies a linked offer/answer pair, and instead say<br>something like "in all offer and answer messages that it generates".<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST encapsulate any DTLS message it sends to an<br>&nbsp;  endpoint inside a "TunneledDtls" message (see Section 6).&nbsp; The Key<br>&nbsp;  Distributor is not required to transmit all messages a given DTLS<br>&nbsp;  association through the same tunnel if more than one tunnel has been<br>&nbsp;  established between it and a Media Distributor.<br><br>I suggest "a given Media Distributor", since the current phrasing seems<br>to allow sending to a different media distributor entirely, which seems<br>unlikely to work since the UUID identifying the DTLS association will<br>not be recognized there.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Key Distributor MUST select a cipher that is supported by both<br>&nbsp;  the endpoint and the Media Distributor to ensure proper HBH<br>&nbsp;  operations.<br><br>(It also has to pick a cipher that it itself supports...)<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  "UnsupportedVersion".&nbsp; The Media Distributor can determine from the<br>&nbsp;  first two octets received what the version number is and that the<br>&nbsp;  message is "UnsupportedVersion".&nbsp; The rest of the data received, if<br><br>I think that the "two" should be either "one" or "four", as the actual<br>message structure has two octets of length between the message type and<br>the unsupported_version structure.&nbsp; One octet is needed to determine<br>that it is an unsupported-version message, and four to determine the<br>highest supported version number.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  struct {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;

But, I really wonder why TLS 1.2 is used rather than TLS 1.3.<br><br>There is no operational consideration around the resiliency of the Key Distributor (load balancing, fail-over, etc.). Should there be some operational considerations ?<br><br>-- Abstract --<br>While I agree that this document could be informational, why does the abstract use words like "defines" "the protocol is designed" as those words are more normative than descriptive. Strongly suggest to rephrase the abstract.<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>Knowledgeable people will understand the E2E and HBH concepts but a figure would be welcome for beginners (really just a suggestion).<br><br>Later and in the same vein "simply forwarding packets" for me (INT AD) packets are layer-3 and it is really unclear in the introduction what is actually forwarded. I.e., 'packets' should be qualified, perhaps in "DTLS messages" or using the same vocabulary of section 5.3 ?<br><br>-- Section 2 --<br>As usual, I am not comfortable when an informational document relies on <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a>, which should (IMHO) be reserved for BCP/standards track documents. Just a comment, feel free to ignore.<br><br>-- Section 5.2 --<br>"which tunnel or tunnels to use to send messages for a given conference is outside the scope of this document." is really a lot of hand waving as I wonder how the document could be used without knowing which tunnels is to be used.<br><br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>There are several occurrences of "an message"... probably a replace all, which went wrong ;-)<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>s/on behalf of the endpoint/on behalf of the endpointS/ ?</div></td>
