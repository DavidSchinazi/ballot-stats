(FWIW, I do consider converting all the links to<br>the "https" scheme worth the churn; thank you for that as well.)<br><br>Some of the examples have gone stale, though (or were inaccurate from<br>the start), particularly with respect to the cryptographic digests and<br>algorithms used for DNSSEC.&nbsp; I do not think that we can in good<br>conscience publish, in 2021, an Internet Standard that shows RSA/MD5<br>signatures as an example!&nbsp; (Specifics in the editorial<br>section-by-section remarks.)<br><br>Also, for Section 1.1, <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a> has an updated <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> boilerplate text to<br>use.<br><br>It's probably worth making a pass through the examples to check for<br>cases where the handle "XXXX" is being used for distinct entities within<br>a single example (as that's not really self-consistent).<br><br>It may be worth noting in the security considerations that, while these<br>RDAP responses allow for retrieval of DNSSEC (key) related information,<br>(AFAICT) the RRSIG DS from the parent zone is not conveyed alongisde it.<br>This means that the DNSSEC keys retrieved by RDAP are disconnected from<br>their containing PKI, and as such are not generally expected to be<br>trusted without additional information.&nbsp; In particular, just the HTTPS<br>channel protecting the RDAP connection is not expected to be authorized<br>to certify the validity of the DNSSEC keys.<br><br>The rest of my remarks are basically editorial or nit level, and I don't<br>expect specific responses to them.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  Contact information is defined using jCards as described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7095/">RFC7095</a>].&nbsp; The "fn" member is required and MUST NOT be null<br>&nbsp;  according to [<a href="/doc/rfc6350/">RFC6350</a>], where an empty "fn" member MAY be used when<br>&nbsp;  the contact name does not exist or is redacted.<br><br>(editorial) The way the last sentence is written suggests that [use of<br>empty "fn" when the name does not exist or is redacted] is a behavior<br>specified in <a href="/doc/rfc6350/">RFC 6350</a>, but based on text searches in <a href="/doc/rfc6350/">RFC 6350</a> I suspect<br>that this statement is actually a clarification new to this document<br>about how the jCard format is being used.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>Going from 7483 to this document we now say that "rdapConformance" MUST<br>appear in the topmost JSON object of a response (vs "appears only" in<br>it).&nbsp; Is the intent to forbid "rdapConformance" from appearing anywhere<br>else in addition to the topmost JSON object?&nbsp; If so, the current text<br>seems insufficient to me.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The following is an example of the link structure:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "value" : "<a href="https://example.com/context_uri">https://example.com/context_uri</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "rel" : "self",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "href" : "<a href="https://example.com/target_uri">https://example.com/target_uri</a>",<br><br>I am prone to confusing myself about <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> links, but it surprised me<br>that "href" differed from "value" for a relation of type "self".<br><br>&nbsp;  The JSON name/values of "rel", "href", "hreflang", "title", "media",<br>&nbsp;  and "type" correspond to values found in Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>].&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  "value" JSON value is the context URI as described by [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>].&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  "value", "rel" and "href" JSON values MUST be specified.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Looking just at the diff from <a href="/doc/rfc7483/">RFC 7483</a> makes it seem that we gain a<br>MUST-level requirement for the "rel" value to be specified, which would<br>not normally be allowed in a transition to Internet Standard.&nbsp; However,<br>it seems that <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> itself requires the presence of "rel", so this is<br>not in practice a new requirement, and thus safe.<br><br>Section 4.5<br><br>I think it's vCard that has a LANGUAGE property; in jCard that would be<br>the "language" key.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>[I did not attempt to validate that the jCards contained in any of the<br>examples conform to <a href="/doc/rfc7095/">RFC 7095</a>.]<br><br>&nbsp;  and names of organizations and individuals.&nbsp; Many of the types of<br>&nbsp;  information that can be represented with jCard have no use in RDAP,<br>&nbsp;  such as birthdays, anniversaries, and gender.<br><br>(nit) I suggest s/no use/little or no use/, just on my instinct of<br>avoiding absolutes when not needed.&nbsp; ("Only a Sith deals in absolutes",<br>right?)<br><br>&nbsp;  The following is an elided example of an entity with embedded<br>&nbsp;  entities.<br><br>(nit) I'd suggest "abbreviated" or "condensed" instead of "elided",<br>which as written would seem to imply that the entire example is omitted.<br>This applies to more than one instance, but I will only mention it once.<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;

These data structures are used to form Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) query responses.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There was constructive feedback and nothing controversial. The authors have addressed the feedback in the latest draft.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document quality is high. Both RIRs and DNRs have implemented the specification in this document. The Implementation Status section lists few of them.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Jasdip Singh (<a href="mailto:jasdips@arin.net">jasdips@arin.net</a>)<br>Area Director: Barry Leiba (<a href="mailto:barryleiba@gmail.com">barryleiba@gmail.com</a>)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The document clearly describes the structure of the RDAP responses for various lookup and search scenarios. It further specifies various field values registered with the IANA RDAP JSON Values registry. The security considerations are sufficiently succinct, including for cache-poisoning prevention. The internationalization considerations are well-written, including for internationalized domain names. The normative and informative references in the end are helpful. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No. It satisfactorily leverages the normative RFCs on JSON, jCard, URI, web linking, DNSSEC, internationalized domain names, and IPv6 and ASN formats.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No concerns. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>N/A<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is a strong WG consensus for RDAP to be on standards track, including this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>None<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>The IANA Considerations section satisfactorily covers the registration of the “application/rdap+json” media type (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/rdap+json">https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/rdap+json</a>) as well as the specification of the IANA RDAP JSON Values registry for notices and remarks, status, role, event action, and domain variant relation fields (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-json-values/rdap-json-values.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-json-values/rdap-json-values.xhtml</a>).<br><br>Additionally, the RDAP Conformance section refers to the IANA RDAP Extensions registry for registering new extensions (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/rdap-extensions.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/rdap-extensions/rdap-extensions.xhtml</a>).<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The JSON used in various examples has been verified using JSONLint (<a href="http://jsonlint.com">jsonlint.com</a>).<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?
