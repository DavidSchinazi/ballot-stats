This comes to mind because of a paper I discovered I was a co-author on (story in the presence of adult beverages) last year, which suggested that congested links in a network could be offloaded by directing a subset of the routes, or a subset of the traffic using those routes, using them to other links that a routing protocol might contend were below par but which provided a non-looping path and had available capacity. The issue was that when routing changed for any reason, these SDN changes had to be undone and redone, a process that could take (in the network of interest) on the order of 40 minutes. My suggestion to my "co-authors" was that they simply change the FIB (which is by definition ephemeral), so that should routing change the FIB would became predictably correct (e.g., with no such optimizations added to it) after having re-converged, and they could now re-optimize the FIB as they saw fit without incurring a potential outage.<br><br>I would suggest that the above reference to a reboot be changed to "Ephemeral state on a router is state that changes from time to time". A reboot is only one of those times.<br><br><br>At the top of page 6, the first paragraph reads:<br><br>&nbsp;  The I2RS agent provides read and write access to selected data on the<br>&nbsp;  routing element that are organized into I2RS Services. Section 4<br>&nbsp;  describes how access is mediated by authentication and access control<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows I2RS agents being able to write ephemeral<br>&nbsp;  static state (e.g.&nbsp; RIB entries), and to read from dynamic static<br>&nbsp;  (e.g.&nbsp; MPLS LSP-ID or number of active BGP peers).&nbsp; In addition, the<br><br>I have a hunch the authors intended to complete the final sentence.<br><br><br>In section 3.1, which comments on "simplicity", I am very much in favor of simplicity in the sense described by <a href="/doc/rfc3439/">RFC 3439</a>. That said, I think the paper misses the mark by a few millimeters. It says<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus, one of the key aims for I2RS is the keep the protocol and<br>&nbsp;  modeling architecture simple.&nbsp; So for each architectural component or<br>&nbsp;  aspect, we ask ourselves "do we need this complexity, or is the<br>&nbsp;  behavior merely nice to have?"<br><br>Often, simplicity is not about whether a feature is itself complex, but about whether what is externalized is complex. Theorists dealing with complexity use a swimming duck as an example: viewed from above the water line, the duck is a picture of placidity in motion, while when viewed from below its paddle feet are madly beating the water. A communication example is in TCP; heaven only knows what is really happening in the network, but TCP narrows the entire discussion into two signal classes - in this RTT, it has received a congestion signal, or it has not, and it has either received acknowledgements indicating forward progress in the session, or it has not. From the application's perspective, there is sufficient forward progress to merit continuing the session at whatever rate it is able to proceed, or progress is inadequate. Within TCP, there is actually a fair bit of complexity. However, what it externalizes to a client application is dead simple.<br><br>So I would go beyond "do I need this complexity" to "do I need for this complexity to be externalized, do I need it at all, and if I need it, is there a way to meet the need with a simpler external API?"<br><br><br>In section 4 and 4.2, I'm concerned about the issues of authorization "for classes of statements", which are mentioned obliquely but not really gone into. My personal bugaboo in this context is the router I use at my home, which is functionally equivalent to two separate routers coexisting in a single chassis. One router connects my home office to my employer using a VPN, and the other is a very typical residential CPE. We have similar issues whenever a router has multiple routing tables or contains multiple virtual routers.

This comes to mind because of a paper I discovered I was a co-author on (story in the presence of adult beverages) last year, which suggested that congested links in a network could be offloaded by directing a subset of the routes, or a subset of the traffic using those routes, using them to other links that a routing protocol might contend were below par but which provided a non-looping path and had available capacity. The issue was that when routing changed for any reason, these SDN changes had to be undone and redone, a process that could take (in the network of interest) on the order of 40 minutes. My suggestion to my "co-authors" was that they simply change the FIB (which is by definition ephemeral), so that should routing change the FIB would became predictably correct (e.g., with no such optimizations added to it) after having re-converged, and they could now re-optimize the FIB as they saw fit without incurring a potential outage.<br><br>I would suggest that the above reference to a reboot be changed to "Ephemeral state on a router is state that changes from time to time". A reboot is only one of those times.<br><br><br>At the top of page 6, the first paragraph reads:<br><br>&nbsp;  The I2RS agent provides read and write access to selected data on the<br>&nbsp;  routing element that are organized into I2RS Services. Section 4<br>&nbsp;  describes how access is mediated by authentication and access control<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows I2RS agents being able to write ephemeral<br>&nbsp;  static state (e.g.&nbsp; RIB entries), and to read from dynamic static<br>&nbsp;  (e.g.&nbsp; MPLS LSP-ID or number of active BGP peers).&nbsp; In addition, the<br><br>I have a hunch the authors intended to complete the final sentence.<br><br><br>In section 3.1, which comments on "simplicity", I am very much in favor of simplicity in the sense described by <a href="/doc/rfc3439/">RFC 3439</a>. That said, I think the paper misses the mark by a few millimeters. It says<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus, one of the key aims for I2RS is the keep the protocol and<br>&nbsp;  modeling architecture simple.&nbsp; So for each architectural component or<br>&nbsp;  aspect, we ask ourselves "do we need this complexity, or is the<br>&nbsp;  behavior merely nice to have?"<br><br>Often, simplicity is not about whether a feature is itself complex, but about whether what is externalized is complex. Theorists dealing with complexity use a swimming duck as an example: viewed from above the water line, the duck is a picture of placidity in motion, while when viewed from below its paddle feet are madly beating the water. A communication example is in TCP; heaven only knows what is really happening in the network, but TCP narrows the entire discussion into two signal classes - in this RTT, it has received a congestion signal, or it has not, and it has either received acknowledgements indicating forward progress in the session, or it has not. From the application's perspective, there is sufficient forward progress to merit continuing the session at whatever rate it is able to proceed, or progress is inadequate. Within TCP, there is actually a fair bit of complexity. However, what it externalizes to a client application is dead simple.<br><br>So I would go beyond "do I need this complexity" to "do I need for this complexity to be externalized, do I need it at all, and if I need it, is there a way to meet the need with a simpler external API?"<br><br><br>In section 4 and 4.2, I'm concerned about the issues of authorization "for classes of statements", which are mentioned obliquely but not really gone into. My personal bugaboo in this context is the router I use at my home, which is functionally equivalent to two separate routers coexisting in a single chassis. One router connects my home office to my employer using a VPN, and the other is a very typical residential CPE. We have similar issues whenever a router has multiple routing tables or contains multiple virtual routers. When I read<br><br>&nbsp;  An I2RS Client is not automatically trustworthy.&nbsp; Each I2RS Client is<br>&nbsp;  associated with identity with a set of scope limitations.<br><br>I read "scope limitations" as a reference to "authorization", but I think this concept needs to be fleshed out more. An I2RS client (or the server it serves), perhaps on an interface, has a set of information, which may be complete, null, or anywhere in between, for which it is trustworthy, and it is not trustworthy for anything else.

This comes to mind because of a paper I discovered I was a co-author on (story in the presence of adult beverages) last year, which suggested that congested links in a network could be offloaded by directing a subset of the routes, or a subset of the traffic using those routes, using them to other links that a routing protocol might contend were below par but which provided a non-looping path and had available capacity. The issue was that when routing changed for any reason, these SDN changes had to be undone and redone, a process that could take (in the network of interest) on the order of 40 minutes. My suggestion to my "co-authors" was that they simply change the FIB (which is by definition ephemeral), so that should routing change the FIB would became predictably correct (e.g., with no such optimizations added to it) after having re-converged, and they could now re-optimize the FIB as they saw fit without incurring a potential outage.<br><br>I would suggest that the above reference to a reboot be changed to "Ephemeral state on a router is state that changes from time to time". A reboot is only one of those times.<br><br><br>At the top of page 6, the first paragraph reads:<br><br>&nbsp;  The I2RS agent provides read and write access to selected data on the<br>&nbsp;  routing element that are organized into I2RS Services. Section 4<br>&nbsp;  describes how access is mediated by authentication and access control<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows I2RS agents being able to write ephemeral<br>&nbsp;  static state (e.g.&nbsp; RIB entries), and to read from dynamic static<br>&nbsp;  (e.g.&nbsp; MPLS LSP-ID or number of active BGP peers).&nbsp; In addition, the<br><br>I have a hunch the authors intended to complete the final sentence.<br><br><br>In section 3.1, which comments on "simplicity", I am very much in favor of simplicity in the sense described by <a href="/doc/rfc3439/">RFC 3439</a>. That said, I think the paper misses the mark by a few millimeters. It says<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus, one of the key aims for I2RS is the keep the protocol and<br>&nbsp;  modeling architecture simple.&nbsp; So for each architectural component or<br>&nbsp;  aspect, we ask ourselves "do we need this complexity, or is the<br>&nbsp;  behavior merely nice to have?"<br><br>Often, simplicity is not about whether a feature is itself complex, but about whether what is externalized is complex. Theorists dealing with complexity use a swimming duck as an example: viewed from above the water line, the duck is a picture of placidity in motion, while when viewed from below its paddle feet are madly beating the water. A communication example is in TCP; heaven only knows what is really happening in the network, but TCP narrows the entire discussion into two signal classes - in this RTT, it has received a congestion signal, or it has not, and it has either received acknowledgements indicating forward progress in the session, or it has not. From the application's perspective, there is sufficient forward progress to merit continuing the session at whatever rate it is able to proceed, or progress is inadequate. Within TCP, there is actually a fair bit of complexity. However, what it externalizes to a client application is dead simple.<br><br>So I would go beyond "do I need this complexity" to "do I need for this complexity to be externalized, do I need it at all, and if I need it, is there a way to meet the need with a simpler external API?"<br><br><br>In section 4 and 4.2, I'm concerned about the issues of authorization "for classes of statements", which are mentioned obliquely but not really gone into. My personal bugaboo in this context is the router I use at my home, which is functionally equivalent to two separate routers coexisting in a single chassis. One router connects my home office to my employer using a VPN, and the other is a very typical residential CPE. We have similar issues whenever a router has multiple routing tables or contains multiple virtual routers. When I read<br><br>&nbsp;  An I2RS Client is not automatically trustworthy.&nbsp; Each I2RS Client is<br>&nbsp;  associated with identity with a set of scope limitations.<br><br>I read "scope limitations" as a reference to "authorization", but I think this concept needs to be fleshed out more. An I2RS client (or the server it serves), perhaps on an interface, has a set of information, which may be complete, null, or anywhere in between, for which it is trustworthy, and it is not trustworthy for anything else. In a network like my home, I could imagine a route controller operated by my employer's IT organization and another operated by me or by my ISP on my behalf. If a single system contains multiple clients or serves multiple servers, that difference of authorization can be important. We understand that in some detail in BGP; it needs to be handled in I2RS as well.</div></td>

This document has been well <br>&nbsp; reviewed and updated to reflect comments received in WG last call. <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Mach Chen<br>&nbsp; Responsible Area Director: Deborah Brungard<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd has reviewed the draft and raised some editoral<br>&nbsp; comments that also have been solved in the latest version. After the review,<br>&nbsp; the Document Shepherd thinks that there is no outstanding issue with the <br>&nbsp; draft and it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from the WG. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarizes the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br> <br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction?
