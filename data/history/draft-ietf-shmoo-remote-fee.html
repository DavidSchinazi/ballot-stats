Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call<br>and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your<br>diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is<br>further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors<br>and editors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>The consensus on this draft reflects broad agreement from the working group.<br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>There was some controversy about earlier versions of the draft that provided <br>meeting fee guidance for fully online meetings as well as meetings with physical<br>presence. The consensus on this part was particularly rough. <br><br>Update July 2023: The draft went through IESG evaluation and had several changes<br>based on feedback from the IESG members and the IETF LLC. The draft went through <br>another Working Group Last Call regarding these changes and there were no concerns<br>brought up.<br> <br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Not applicable. This document is connected to participation in IETF meetings and<br>does not define any protocols.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>## Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes. Based on my review of the latest version of the document it is my opinion<br>that this draft is needed, clearly written, and ready to be progressed.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Best Current Practice. The original intent of the working group was to publish <br>an informational guidance document. There were discussions of the document in <br>the WG which led to the current version which provides BCP level guidance. The <br>WG was rechartered to reflect this change in intended status of this document.<br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>Yes. I have confirmed with the authors that any and all appropriate IPR <br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <br><a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>There is an I-D nits warning about non-ASCII characters in the draft and lines<br>being too long. I have verified that this is because one of the authors has a <br>name that contains an umlaut. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>No.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>None.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; list them.<br><br>No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).<br><br>There are no IANA considerations.<br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>There are no IANA allocations required.<br></div></td>

Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call<br>and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your<br>diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is<br>further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors<br>and editors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>The consensus on this draft reflects broad agreement from the working group.<br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>There was some controversy about earlier versions of the draft that provided <br>meeting fee guidance for fully online meetings as well as meetings with physical<br>presence. The consensus on this part was particularly rough. <br><br>Update July 2023: The draft went through IESG evaluation and had several changes<br>based on feedback from the IESG members and the IETF LLC. The draft went through <br>another Working Group Last Call regarding these changes and there were no concerns<br>brought up.<br> <br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Not applicable. This document is connected to participation in IETF meetings and<br>does not define any protocols.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>## Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes. Based on my review of the latest version of the document it is my opinion<br>that this draft is needed, clearly written, and ready to be progressed.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Best Current Practice. The original intent of the working group was to publish <br>an informational guidance document. There were discussions of the document in <br>the WG which led to the current version which provides BCP level guidance. The <br>WG was rechartered to reflect this change in intended status of this document.<br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>Yes. I have confirmed with the authors that any and all appropriate IPR <br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <br><a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>There is an I-D nits warning about non-ASCII characters in the draft and lines<br>being too long. I have verified that this is because one of the authors has a <br>name that contains an umlaut. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>No.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>None.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; list them.<br><br>No.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).<br><br>There are no IANA considerations.<br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>There are no IANA allocations required.<br></div></td>

Many thanks to John Klensin for his in depth review: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/art/9Nv4gQqKizP8yIJH8qb07nTxQd4/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/art/9Nv4gQqKizP8yIJH8qb07nTxQd4/</a>, and to the authors and others for replying to it.<br><br>I believe that there is value in publishing a high level principle document as a direction to LLC, even though I also understand that there is some intrinsic ambiguity with writing such a document. The line is hard to draw. I'm balloting DISCUSS to go over the points below, which I really believe are worth addressing. I tried to be as actionable as possible.<br><br>* The reference to "Observer" as is in the document does not add much, and rather makes it unclear as the role of "observer" is not explicitly defined (neither in this document nor on <a href="/doc/rfc3935/">RFC 3935</a>). I would have liked this document to also specify the observer role and that the free observer option should also be supported as much as possible, however I seem to understand it out of scope for this document (a shame really, since it is so close to the topic). I suggest to just remove "(in contrast to an "observer")" and hope that someone will find the energy to pick up the topic and bring it to shmoo.<br><br>* The document should give guidance to the LLC keep the identities of those who have have applied for fee waivers and any information that may be disclosed by those applications confidential. Mirja said "However, my assumption is that individual registration data (except the name in the participants list) is treated as confidential anyway" so then why not just state it in this document and make it explicit. In practice, I like John's suggestion of the following text or something of the sort be added: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &gt; "if someone applies for a fee waiver, the LLC is expected to collect the absolutely minimum amount of information required to allow..." (whatever it is they decide they need to allow) "and the community will be told what information is to be collected so that potential applicants can<br>made informed decisions"<br><br>* I understand that it was a conscious choice and that the sentence was discussed quite a bit, however I also think the following sentence in section 3 does not give any guidance to the LLC, and is in general just unclear:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; If unlimited free remote participation is determined to adversely affect the number of paying participants or the cost of free participation emerges to be a signification factor, the LLC might implement additional measures to manage these costs. <br><br>I believe some clarification is sorely needed as to what additional measures are envisioned (I believe this was also one of Roman's points). Somewhere in the discussion, Mirja said: "But we didn’t want to rule out anything because if it’s a problem for the financial viability of the IETF, it really goes beyond the scope of this document to give explicit guidance."<br>It is strange to make a guidance document not give any guidance at all here...</div></td>

However I'm not going to withhold a needed ballot to advance it on that basis, and the parts I found most problematic have been somewhat addressed in the latest revision, so I'm moving to NOOBJ. I do have some remaining comments, below. Some are new with 06 and some date back to 05.<br><br>### Section 2, vagueness of restriction of use of personal information (new)<br><br>"any personal information that is collected with respect to the use of the free remote participation option must be held confidential"<br><br>If it's necessary to provide this level of micromanagement at all (I would be happy for the sentence to be struck, and rely on the discretion of the LLC to do the right thing, as we do with other PII they collect), then shouldn't it say confidential *from whom*, and what the allowed and disallowed uses are? For example, may information be used to generate aggregate statistics, e.g. "X% of free participants were first-time, Y% were students"? There is a hint in Section 4 that some uses are OK, "Aggregated data on the number and percentage of free registrations used should be published, as this will permit analysis of the use and change in use over time of the free registration option without revealing personal information", but a maximalist reading of the Section 2 text would lead one to think that only the greatest amount of aggregation is permissible, i.e. only "X% of our registrations were free", nothing more.<br><br>(Also, nit, not "held confidential". Should be "kept confidential" or "held in confidence".)<br><br>### Section 3, reference to Padlipsky, "Perspective on the ARPANET reference model" (new)<br><br>"As defined in the <a href="/doc/rfc871/">RFC871</a>".<br><br>That isn't the right reference. Probably you wanted <a href="/doc/rfc8711/">RFC 8711</a>? Mistaken ref recurs later in the paragraph. <br><br>### Section 4, wording (longstanding)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fee<br>&nbsp;  payment structure is set the by the IETF LLC such that the viability<br>&nbsp;  of the IETF and the need of IETF participants to work productively<br>&nbsp;  within the IETF can be warranted.<br><br>I don’t think “warranted” is the word wanted here? In this context it means “justified”. Probably you meant something more like “supported” or “ensured”? Come to think of it, “viability” and “need” seem not to quite work together right either. Would it be right to also change “need” to “ability”, making it “... such that the viability of the IETF and the ability of IETF participants to work productively within the IETF can be ensured”? <br><br>(Also, nit: "set the by the" -&gt; "set by the")<br><br>So, NEW:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fee<br>&nbsp;  payment structure is set the by the IETF LLC such that the viability<br>&nbsp;  of the IETF and the ability of IETF participants to work productively<br>&nbsp;  within the IETF can be ensured.<br><br>## NITS<br><br>"signification factor" --&gt; "significant factor" (unless you really did intend to use it as technical jargon, but if you did you probably need to go into much more detail to make clear your meaning)<br><br>Some other nits noted with related comments.<br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

The line is hard to draw. I'm balloting DISCUSS to go over the points below, which I really believe are worth addressing. I tried to be as actionable as possible.<br><br>* The reference to "Observer" as is in the document does not add much, and rather makes it unclear as the role of "observer" is not explicitly defined (neither in this document nor on <a href="/doc/rfc3935/">RFC 3935</a>). I would have liked this document to also specify the observer role and that the free observer option should also be supported as much as possible, however I seem to understand it out of scope for this document (a shame really, since it is so close to the topic). I suggest to just remove "(in contrast to an "observer")" and hope that someone will find the energy to pick up the topic and bring it to shmoo.<br><br>* The document should give guidance to the LLC keep the identities of those who have have applied for fee waivers and any information that may be disclosed by those applications confidential. Mirja said "However, my assumption is that individual registration data (except the name in the participants list) is treated as confidential anyway" so then why not just state it in this document and make it explicit. In practice, I like John's suggestion of the following text or something of the sort be added: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &gt; "if someone applies for a fee waiver, the LLC is expected to collect the absolutely minimum amount of information required to allow..." (whatever it is they decide they need to allow) "and the community will be told what information is to be collected so that potential applicants can<br>made informed decisions"<br><br>* I understand that it was a conscious choice and that the sentence was discussed quite a bit, however I also think the following sentence in section 3 does not give any guidance to the LLC, and is in general just unclear:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt; If unlimited free remote participation is determined to adversely affect the number of paying participants or the cost of free participation emerges to be a signification factor, the LLC might implement additional measures to manage these costs. <br><br>I believe some clarification is sorely needed as to what additional measures are envisioned (I believe this was also one of Roman's points). Somewhere in the discussion, Mirja said: "But we didn’t want to rule out anything because if it’s a problem for the financial viability of the IETF, it really goes beyond the scope of this document to give explicit guidance."<br>It is strange to make a guidance document not give any guidance at all here...</div></td>

So, congratulations to the authors, shepherd, and the SHMOO WG.<br><br>But, I am ambivalent on this document: it is of course good will to offer a free access, but it is also a little 'hand waving' to the IETF LLC that must both avoid loss and offer free access.

Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Not applicable. This document is connected to participation in IETF meetings and<br>does not define any protocols.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>7.

Based on my review of the latest version of the document it is my opinion<br>that this draft is needed, clearly written, and ready to be progressed.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed?

What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Best Current Practice. The original intent of the working group was to publish <br>an informational guidance document. There were discussions of the document in <br>the WG which led to the current version which provides BCP level guidance. The <br>WG was rechartered to reflect this change in intended status of this document.<br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>Yes.

If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15].

Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>No.<br><br>20.
