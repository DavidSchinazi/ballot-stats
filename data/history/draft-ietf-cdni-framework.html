But how does the dCDN know whether to include the Forwarded header, other than by some out-of-band arrangement with the uCDN?

There was one that<br>is not addressed in -12, but which I'll make a comment since<br>it'd not be correct to block on this, but I'd encourage fixing<br>it if possible. The discuss point said:<br><br>"<br>(3) section 6: Am I right in thinking that this is the<br>first time we're standardising protocols related to CDNs?<br>(That is, we have not prevously standardised any CDNi or<br>CSP/CDN protocols.) If so, then I question whether the<br>"main trust issue" is transitive trust. That is an issue<br>certainly, but we are also here standardising the logging<br>that has until now been handled in proprietary ways by CSPs<br>and CDNs, which arguably means that the associated privacy<br>issues for the end user need to be considered as in scope<br>and it is not sufficient to simply say "do what CDNs do."<br>"<br><br>I think s/main trust issue/a trust issue/ would be a good<br>change, since (I hope) we're not only dealing with the <br>perspectives of content holders and CDNs.<br><br><br>-- Original comments below, I've not checked how they <br>were all handled, but feel free to ping me if chatting <br>more would be useful.<br><br>- 1.1: Does the CDN-Domain include or exclude a default or<br>non-default port number? Saying exactly which part of the<br><a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> ABNF you mean might help here. Or if that's for<br>later, maybe say that now here so folks don't get confused.<br><br>- 1.1: Also on CDN-Domain - how does this play with the SOP<br>and/or CORS or does it and what if the URL is not an HTTP<br>URL? I'd be fine if you want to punt until later on other<br>URI schemes btw, not asking that you boil an ocean now, but<br>better to be a bit more precise on this I think.<br><br>- 1.1: I think it might help to define (or reference a<br>definition for) "footprint" - for me at least its not clear<br>what combination(s) of topological, geographic or other<br>information is intended here.&nbsp; I'm not asking that you<br>provide the data model in 1.1 though but I think a<br>definition could help.<br><br>- 2.1.1: You don't say why DNAME might be preferable to<br>CNAME. I wondered:-) And btw, I assume mention of wildcards<br>in DNS zone files isn't needed here as relevant DNS servers<br>maybe don't tend to do that?<br><br>- 2.1.2: The client IP will only be known if there's no<br>proxy or the proxy passes on the client IP via XFF or<br>similar though. Worth noting?<br><br>- 4.8: I could imagine CDNs serving up frequently loaded<br>static content that's not tiny, like maybe JS libraries<br>that are widely used. W3C have an early piece of work<br>that's related [1] so just noting that and wondering if it<br>might be wise to take it into account here at some stage.<br>(It *might* be a problem if that's not considered, but that<br>might be ok for now since the W3C stuff is drafty. Maybe<br>worth a look if the WG didn't already.)<br><br>&nbsp;  [1] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/</a><br><br>- section 8: As with section 6, I think the "just consider<br>the delta between CDN and CDNi" is not the right approach<br>here as that could result in CDNi making e.g. HTTPS less<br>easy to deploy. There is a significiant enough history of<br>that approach to security going wrong, e.g. when IEEE did<br>Wired *Equivalent* Privacy (WEP) they ended up addressing<br>the wrong target and had to go back and substantially re-do<br>stuff a number of times. I would suggest that simply<br>referring to [2] here would be a better approach.&nbsp; This is<br>not a discuss because I assume that CDNi protocol documents<br>will in any case have to deal with how they meet those<br>requirements and will not be able to point here and say<br>"same as CDN, nothing to see here." If that last was the<br>WG's plan, then maybe we should chat more about that now<br>too. (Since we will later otherwise:-)<br><br>&nbsp;  [2] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-17#section-9">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-requirements-17#section-9</a><br><br>- Section 8: Requirement SEC-2 (DoS resistance) is not<br>mentioned at all. Did the WG consider whether or not that<br>requirement ought result in text here? I could buy an<br>argument that this requirement won't really be discussed<br>in any detail until later, but wanted to check.</div></td>

Just because this document doesn't define all of the message formats and particular HTTP exchanges doesn't means it's not a protocol document; it's just one *piece* of a protocol, and I'm guessing that this document will be normative upon any future protocol documents coming out of this group.<br><br>That said, I'm not going to stand in the way of publication if we decide that Informational is OK.

If not, why not?&nbsp; For example<br>in 4.4 I was surprised not to see any mention of privacy<br>issues or jurisdiction issues. Why does that not need a<br>mention? Are there really no open issues associated with<br>the LI and privacy? Just to pick on one of the possibly<br>many juicy issues: what if the browser request has DNT set?<br>(I don't expect this doc to resolve that issue btw.) <br><br>(3) section 6: Am I right in thinking that this is the<br>first time we're standardising protocols related to CDNs?<br>(That is, we have not prevously standardised any CDNi or<br>CSP/CDN protocols.) If so, then I question whether the<br>"main trust issue" is transitive trust. That is an issue<br>certainly, but we are also here standardising the logging<br>that has until now been handled in proprietary ways by CSPs<br>and CDNs, which arguably means that the associated privacy<br>issues for the end user need to be considered as in scope<br>and it is not sufficient to simply say "do what CDNs do."<br>If those are in scope, then I would further argue that that<br>is also a significant trust issue. If we figure out how to<br>handle discuss point 2 above, then this might just amount<br>to a simple reference to whatever text results (or maybe<br>that text would just go in this section.)<br><br>(4) 4.7: Just checking: This made me wonder about how CDNI<br>and HTTP/2.0 are intended to play together. I think there's<br>been relevant discussion on httpbis about similar issues<br>but haven't followed that. Is someone tracking how CDNI and<br>HTTP/2.0 will interact? If not then wouldn't that be a good<br>idea since both are likely to arrive as RFCs about the same<br>time?&nbsp; (To be clear: I've no strong opinion on the details<br>here, nor on sequencing of outputs, but would just like to<br>know we don't have two WGs ignoring one another when they<br>shouldn't.

If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>[DM] No<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>[DM] There was solid consensus on early requests for input on whether or not the document was ready for last call.&nbsp; Later requests for input after reviews and iterations of the document took place resulted is feedback from a fewer number of WG participants.&nbsp; I feel this was the result of previous consensus and input and relative approval of the minor incremental changes.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>[DM] No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>[DM] Done.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>[DM] Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>[DM] No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>[DM] No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?
