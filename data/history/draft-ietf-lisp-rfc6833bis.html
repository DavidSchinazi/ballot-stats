&nbsp; &nbsp; in [<a href="/doc/rfc8060/">RFC8060</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Just to check: if I get a Map-Request that uses an AFI I don't<br>recognize, I have to abort parsing the packet since I don't know how<br>many bytes to skip?&nbsp; It seems like this might negatively affect the<br>ability to introduce new AFIs.<br><br>&nbsp;  Map-Reply Record:&nbsp; When the M-bit is set, this field is the size of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; single "Record" in the Map-Reply format.&nbsp; This Map-Reply record<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contains the EID-to-RLOC mapping entry associated with the Source<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EID.&nbsp; This allows the ETR that will receive this Map-Request to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cache the data if it chooses to do so.<br><br>We could perhaps mention something about whether the ETR believes the<br>message is trustworthy, too, since it does not have the benefit of<br>having gone through mapping system validation.<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Map-Requests MUST be rate-limited to 1 per second per EID-prefix.<br>&nbsp;  After 10 retransmits without receiving the corresponding Map-Reply<br>&nbsp;  must wait 30 seconds.<br><br>nit: incomplete sentence.<br><br>&nbsp;  a Map-Cache entry.&nbsp; If the ETR (when it is an xTR co-located as an<br>&nbsp;  ITR) has a Map-Cache entry that matches the "piggybacked" EID and the<br>&nbsp;  RLOC is in the Locator-Set for the cached entry, then it MAY send the<br>&nbsp;  "verifying Map-Request" directly to the originating Map-Request<br>&nbsp;  source.&nbsp; If the RLOC is not in the Locator-Set, then the ETR MUST<br>&nbsp;  send the "verifying Map-Request" to the "piggybacked" EID.&nbsp; Doing<br>&nbsp;  this forces the "verifying Map-Request" to go through the mapping<br>&nbsp;  database system to reach the authoritative source of information<br>&nbsp;  about that EID, guarding against RLOC-spoofing in the "piggybacked"<br>&nbsp;  mapping data.<br><br>side note: Does it make much practical difference to send the<br>Map-Request to the EID as the destination address vs. just consulting<br>the mapping system to look up that EID?&nbsp; It seems like the former is<br>strictly more work, and I'm not sure what additional benefit is gained<br>from that additional work.&nbsp; I guess, reachability information for the<br>EID in question.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  P: This is the probe-bit, which indicates that the Map-Reply is in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; response to a Locator reachability probe Map-Request.&nbsp; The 'Nonce'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; field MUST contain a copy of the nonce value from the original<br>&nbsp;

This is the number of records in this reply message.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A record is comprised of that portion of the packet labeled<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Record' above and occurs the number of times equal to Record<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Count.<br><br>We say earlier that the record count in a Map-Request is (artificially)<br>limited to 1 for this document; we might note here that the reply count<br>can be larger than the request count, e.g., when there's a need to<br>return more-specifics that are carved out from the best match to the<br>requested EID.<br><br>&nbsp;  Locator Count:&nbsp; This is the number of Locator entries in the given<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Record.&nbsp; A Locator entry comprises what is labeled above as 'Loc'.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Locator count can be 0, indicating that there are no Locators<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the EID-Prefix.<br><br>Do we want to say "also known as a negative Map-Reply"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (0) No-Action:&nbsp; The Map-Cache is kept alive, and no packet<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation occurs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) Natively-Forward:&nbsp; The packet is not encapsulated or dropped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but natively forwarded.<br><br>It might be worth a few words about how these two differ, as the "no<br>encapsulation" part is superficially similar.<br><br>&nbsp;  A: The Authoritative bit MAY only be set to 1 by an ETR.&nbsp; A Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Server generating Map-Reply messages as a proxy MUST NOT set the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A-bit to 1 by an ETR, and not a Map-Server generating Map-Reply<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages as a proxy.&nbsp; This bit indicates to requesting ITRs that<br><br>nit: looks like a botched edit, with the "and not a Map-Server<br>generating Map-Reply messages as a proxy" sticking around when it should<br>have been removed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Map-Reply was not originated by a LISP node managed at the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; site that owns the EID-Prefix.<br><br>Please confirm that the "not" is correct, here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.5% of the traffic.&nbsp; If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to load-split the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; traffic.&nbsp;

 When ITRs receive ICMP Network Unreachable or Host Unreachable<br>&nbsp;  messages as a method to determine unreachability, they will refrain<br>&nbsp;  from using Locators that are described in Locator lists of Map-<br>&nbsp;  Replies.&nbsp; However, using this approach is unreliable because many<br>&nbsp;  network operators turn off generation of ICMP Destination Unreachable<br>&nbsp;  messages.<br><br>I think there is also some level of unreliability in the other direction<br>-- even when following <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-opsec-icmp-filtering/">draft-ietf-opsec-icmp-filtering</a> and validating<br>the echoed contents, the contents could in some cases be sufficiently<br>predictable that an attacker could spoof them.&nbsp; Having random<br>nonces/ports be in use helps, of course, but the ICMP message could be<br>generated in response to arbitrary traffic, not all of which will<br>necessarily have all of those.<br><br>&nbsp;  The ITR can test the reachability of the unreachable Locator by<br>&nbsp;  sending periodic Requests.&nbsp; Both Requests and Replies MUST be rate-<br><br>nit: I think we haven't been using the bare forms of "Requests" and<br>"Replies" (in favor of the "Map-" prefixed forms).<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;

Why is<br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>&nbsp; This draft is targeting Standard Track publication. It is the proper type of RFC, since is the evolution of <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>, which is experimental and is one of items in the LISP WG charter. The RFC type is indicated in the page header.<br><br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>	The document provides the specifications for the control-plane of LISP&nbsp; (Locator/Id Separation Protocol).&nbsp; LISP defines two namespaces, End-point&nbsp; Identifiers (EIDs) that identify end-hosts and Routing Locators (RLOCs) that identify network attachment points. In this way, LISP effectively separates control from data, and allows routers to create overlay networks.&nbsp; LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.<br>&nbsp; Mappings are distributed using a mapping distribution service. This document defines the front-end of such service, leveraging on the LISP Map-Server and LISP-Map-Resolver elements.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>	The current LISP WG charter has as main task porting the main LISP specifications on Standard Track. The WG has decided to focus on two main documents, one with the specifications of the data-plane and the other with the specifications of the control-plane. This document concerns the control-plane. The WG has showed support to the document from its first submission as individual draft and adopted it right away. On the technical side there was agreement in the WG and little discussion took place, mainly related include some features/improvements not present in <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a> and adding text that originally was in the LISP data-plane document. On the organisation of the document, more specifically on what to put in the data-plane document and what to put in the control-plane document there has been quite some discussion. The current version is the trade-off the WG&nbsp; achieved and for which clear consensus has been reached. The version of the document that was approved during WG Last Call is -10. As a shepherd I required a few editorial changes to the document to fix some nits.<br><br>Post-Publication Request Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; After requesting publication the document went through IESG review. The document raised several question from the Security and Transport Area ADs.<br>&nbsp; In order to solve the issues raised the document went through 16 revisions (publication was requested for revision 11, now is 27).<br>&nbsp; All revisions have been also presented in the LISP WG so to be sure that the group was aware of all changes and that there were no objections. No concerns were raised by the LISP WG. All issues seem to be addressed. That is why a new Internet reviews has been performed so to check whether there are concerns from the IETF community.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>	There are at least three independent implementations of the LISP control-plane.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br><br>&nbsp; Luigi Iannone <br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Deborah Brungard .<br><br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br><br>I closely followed the document while in the WG and afterwards as a shepherd during IESG review.<br>The document has improved a lot in quality thanks to the IESG and the authors working together. As previously stated, document changes have been always presented to the LISP WG to make sure that the updated do not raise any concern.&nbsp; The output of the IDnits tool for the -27 version of the document is provided on point 11. The following issues easily fixable have been found:<br>&nbsp; - The draft header indicates that this document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC6833</a>, but the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; abstract doesn't seem to directly say this.&nbsp; It does mention <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC6833</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; though, so this could be OK.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt; Actually it obsoletes 6830 and 6833 as correctly written in header+abstract+intro. It appears to be a limitation of the IDnitstool.<br>&nbsp; - Missing Reference: 'Key ID' is mentioned on line 1088, but not defined<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; =&gt; Not actually a reference the IDnits tool is misled by the use of brackets.<br>&nbsp; - 3 Unused references: Can be deleted while in the RFC Editor queue.<br>&nbsp; - 8 Outdated references, from which 3 are normative but are documents that already past the WG Last Call, hence, the RFC Editor will fix it zith the right RFC numbers.<br><br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	As the document shepherd I have no concerns.<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No broader review is required for this document. It went under a through reviewduring the last year.<br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>	I have no specific concerns or issues to point out.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; All authors have made conforming IPR disclosure.<br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>	No IPR disclosures have been filed concerning this specific document. However, there is an IPR disclosure filled by Huawei on <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>, hence, because this document is based on that one, the same IPR disclosure may relate to this document.<br><br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There has been clear strong consensus behind this document, showing that the WG as a whole understand and agree with it and no objection have been raised during the document review.<br><br><br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>	Nobody did show extreme discontent nor threatened an appeal.<br><br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

hopefully the writing work in<br>question will be easy to retrieve.<br><br>Other than that we're down to just a few remaining points, two of which<br>I believe should be trivial to resolve.<br><br><br>In Section 5.6 we say that "implementations of this spsecification SHOULD include<br>support for HMAC-SHA256-128+HKDF-SHA256 but section 9 says "implementation<br>MUST support HMAC-SHA256-128+HKDF-SHA256", which is internally inconsistent;<br>my understanding from a previous discussion with the authors was that<br>HMAC-SHA256-128+HKDF-SHA256 would be a SHOULD and it was HMAC-SHA256-128<br>that was MUST.<br><br>The condition for Map-Notify-Ack terminating Map-Notify retransmission<br>seems incomplete.&nbsp; Specifically, we should only accept the<br>Map-Notify-Ack to stop retransmission if the authentication data validates<br>(and maybe that it uses the same Key-ID as the Map-Notify, though that<br>might be overkill).&nbsp; So just "a Map-Notify-Ack is received by the <br>Map-Server with the same nonce" is not quite enough; we'd want to say<br>"an authenticated Map-Notify-Ack is received by the Map-Server with the same<br>nonce".<br><br>In Section 9:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The LISP-SEC<br>&nbsp;  protocol defines a mechanism for providing origin authentication,<br>&nbsp;  integrity, anti-replay, protection, and prevention of 'man-in-the-<br>&nbsp;  middle' and 'prefix overclaiming' attacks on the Map-Request/Map-<br>&nbsp;  Reply exchange.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think this document provides anti-replay protection for the<br>Map-Request/Map-Reply exchange (by virtue of the single-use nonce), so<br>we should remove "anti-replay" from the list of features LISP-SEC provides<br>for the Map-Request/Map-Reply exchange.<br><br>I think we need greater clarity on the 'E' and 'M' bits in the ECM format;<br>are we perhaps defining them now in anticipation of future usage by<br>other documents (e.g., ones that define specific mapping system implementations)?<br>in particular (with quotes from my ballot position on the -24 for context):<br>&gt;&nbsp;  E:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the to-ETR bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, the Map-Server's<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  intention is to forward the ECM to an authoritative ETR.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I think this needs to say more about which message flows this bit is<br>&gt; defined for.&nbsp; Presumably the ITR will never use it for sending an<br>&gt; encapsulated Map-Request to a Map-Resolver, but there seem to be plenty of<br>&gt; places where ECM wrapping is used.<br><br>IIUC, the main ECM-wrapped messages we consider in this document are<br>ITR-to-Map-Resolver Map-Requests and Map-Server-to-ETR Map-Requests.<br>Is it an invariant that the ECM 'E' and 'M' bits can never be set at the same time<br>(as they are only defined to have meaning for the different flows I list)?<br>In an off-list discussion I got a clarification that "The ETR bit is used so the<br>Map-Server knows that the entity registering is an xTR versus a SDN or other<br>type of controller that is registering mappings but doesn’t have a full LISP<br>protocol engine implementation and can’t send Map-Replies" which sounds like<br>it applies to a Map-Register ("is registering mappings") but I didn't think that<br>Map-Register was defined as a possible LCM to be in an ECM.&nbsp; (Maybe I'm just<br>confused about that.)<br><br>The main thing I still don't understand here is: what entity is going to interpret<br>the E-bit and change behavior depending on its value?<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;  M:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the to-MS bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, a Map-Request is being<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sent to a co-located Map-Resolver and Map-Server where the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  message can be processed directly by the Map-Server versus the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Resolver using the LISP-DDT procedures in [<a href="/doc/rfc8111/">RFC8111</a>].<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How does the sender know that its configured Map-Resolver is also a<br>&gt; Map-Server?&nbsp; It's unclear to me why this needs a bit in the message as<br>&gt; opposed to just happening based on the attributes of the receiving<br>&gt; Map-Server.<br><br>It sounds like this is only useful when the ECM contains a Map-Request<br>from ITR to Map-Resolver, but I don't know how an ITR would know to<br>(not) set this bit or what entity is going to change behavior depending<br>on the value of the bit.</div></td>

It still seems<br>needlessly ambiguous and confusing to me, though.]<br>There are many instances (some noted in my Comment) where a<br>bidirectional interaction between two xTRs is described, yet the peers are<br>identified as "ITR" and "ETR".&nbsp; This is very confusing when the entity<br>named as "ITR" is described as performing ETR functionality, or vice versa;<br>pedagogically, it would be much better to use non-role-based names for the<br>entities while describing these exchanges.<br><br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the Control-Plane and Mapping Service for the<br>&nbsp;  Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types<br>&nbsp;  of LISP-speaking devices -- the LISP Map-Resolver and LISP Map-Server<br><br>This is a -bis document; is "new" really appropriate?&nbsp; (It also appears in<br>the Introduction, of course.)<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP is not intended to address problems of connectivity and scaling<br>&nbsp;  on behalf of arbitrary communicating parties.&nbsp; Relevant situations<br>&nbsp;  are described in the scoping section of the introduction to<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a>].<br><br>It looks like we inline that text into this document as Section 1.1, below;<br>perhaps this paragraph is no longer needed, then?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  A Map-Server is a device that publishes EID-Prefixes in a LISP<br>&nbsp;  mapping database on behalf of a set of ETRs.&nbsp; When it receives a Map<br>&nbsp;  Request (typically from an ITR), it consults the mapping database to<br><br>nit: isn't it typically from a Map-Resolver (or other<br>mapping-system-internal entity)?&nbsp; It's originally from an ITR, of course,<br>but the flow assumed by this document is described as<br>ITR-&gt;Map-Resolver-&gt;mapping-system-internals-&gt;Map-Server-&gt;ETR.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that while it is conceivable that a Map-Resolver could cache<br>&nbsp;  responses to improve performance, issues surrounding cache management<br>&nbsp;  will need to be resolved so that doing so will be reliable and<br><br>nit: s/will/would/?<br><br>&nbsp;  practical.&nbsp; As initially deployed, Map-Resolvers will operate only in<br>&nbsp;  a non-caching mode, decapsulating and forwarding Encapsulated Map<br>&nbsp;  Requests received from ITRs.&nbsp; Any specification of caching<br>&nbsp;  functionality is out of scope for this document.<br><br>I think it's better to say something like "In this specification," rather<br>than "As initially deployed".<br><br>Also, I've confused myself a couple times from this -- it's only the<br>Map-Resolver that doesn't cache; the ITR is free to cache.&nbsp; It might be<br>helpful to call out that distinction here.&nbsp; Interestingly, in Section 1 we made<br>an analogy from DNS *caching* resolvers to Map-Resolvers; would an<br>analogy from DNS *recursive* resolvers have been more apt?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>I still think it's needlessly confusing to duplicate the IP/UDP header<br>layout figure here, at least without a prefacing comment noting that this<br>is the standard IP+UDP header with the IP addresses replaced by RLOCs.<br>But this is a non-blocking comment and the authors have already replied, so<br>feel free to ignore.<br><br>&nbsp;  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept packets when either the<br>&nbsp;  source port or destination UDP port is set to 4342 due to NATs<br>&nbsp;  changing port number values.<br><br>It's not entirely clear to me what this requirement is saying.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A: This is an authoritative bit, which is set to 0 for UDP-based Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Requests sent by an ITR.&nbsp; It is set to 1 when an ITR wants the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; destination site to return the Map-Reply rather than the mapping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; database system returning a Map-Reply.<br><br>Given that we've already disclaimed caching in the mapping system, aren't<br>all responses supposed to come from the destination site rather than the<br>mapping system?&nbsp; Searching the rest of the document for the string<br>"authoritative" suggests that this is perhaps intended to avoid proxying<br>behavior from terminating Map-Servers (but when an ETR requests proxying is<br>it still guaranteed to be able to generate its own Map-Replys?), in which<br>case this could probably be phrased better.<br><br>&nbsp;  P: This is the probe-bit, which indicates that a Map-Request SHOULD<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be treated as a Locator reachability probe.&nbsp; The receiver SHOULD<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; respond with a Map-Reply with the probe-bit set, indicating that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Map-Reply is a Locator reachability probe reply, with the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nonce copied from the Map-Request. [...]<br><br>Why are these only SHOULD?<br><br>I still think it is needlessly confusing to have bit labels that differ<br>only by letter case.&nbsp; While this may not be confusing for the authors,<br>there are plenty of other people who could potentially be confused by it.<br>(Also, why are there two bits 'R' next to a 'Rsvd' field that all have the<br>same "reserved" semantics?)<br><br>&nbsp;  L: This is the local-xtr bit.&nbsp; It is used by an xTR in a LISP site to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tell other xTRs in the same site that it is part of the RLOC-set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the LISP site.&nbsp; The L-bit is set to 1 when the RLOC is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sender's IP address.<br><br>At this point in the document, we haven't seen anything to suggest that an<br>xTR is going to be sending Map-Requests to other xTRs in the same site; a<br>forward reference is probably in order.<br><br>&nbsp;  D: This is the dont-map-reply bit.&nbsp; It is used in the SMR procedure<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; described in Section 6.1.&nbsp; When an xTR sends an SMR Map-Request<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message, it doesn't need a Map-Reply returned.&nbsp; When this bit is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set, the receiver of the Map-Request does not return a Map-Reply.<br><br>nit: I'd suggest consolidating the behavior description and leaving the<br>explanations all at the end, so "This is the dont-map-reply bit.&nbsp; When this<br>bit is set, the receiver of the Map-Request does not return a Map-Reply.<br>It is used in the SMR procedure described in Section 6.1; when an xTR<br>sends an SMR Map-Request message, it doesn't need a Map-Reply returned."<br><br>&nbsp;  Nonce:&nbsp; This is an 8-octet random value created by the sender of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Map-Request.&nbsp; This nonce will be returned in the Map-Reply.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nonce is used as an index to identify the corresponding Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Request when a Map-Reply message is received.&nbsp; The nonce MUST be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generated by a properly seeded pseudo-random (or strong random)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source.&nbsp; See [<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>] for advice on generating security-sensitive<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; random data.<br><br>Since this value is just serving as a "number used once" (i.e., to match<br>replies to requests), this is a stronger requirement than we need -- it<br>merely needs to be unique per ITR.<br><br>&nbsp;

 failure.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This seems like a type mismatch between RLOC/EID -- per the headers, the<br>destination address should be an RLOC, but we are forced to use an EID in<br>this case.&nbsp; The disparity should probably be called out and explained,<br>e.g., clarify that it's okay to use an EID as destination inside ECM<br>encapsulation (and, apparently, if we believe Section 5.8, that it's<br>required to do so).<br><br>&nbsp;

 attempts.&nbsp; After this time, an xTR can only get the RLOC-set change<br>&nbsp;  by later querying the mapping system or by RLOC-probing one of the<br>&nbsp;  RLOCs of the existing cached RLOC-set to get the new RLOC-set.<br><br>What RLOC-set change?&nbsp;

 D:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the DDT-bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, the sender is requesting a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Referral message to be returned.&nbsp; The details of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;  this section.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: "this section" means 5.8; presumably we mean Section 5.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>I agree with Warren that the direct usage of mapping information included<br>in an SMR presents a substantial attack surface, both for DoS and<br>potentially for redirecting traffic wholesale (whether for snooping<br>purposes or use as volumetric DoS to a third-party target).&nbsp; There is some<br>discussion of the risks of spoofing with this sort of "gleaming" behavior,<br>but I strongly suggest mentioning something like "this technique presents a<br>risk of off-path spoofing; see Section 9 for details" at each such<br>non-validated scheme for learning mapping information.<br><br>&nbsp;  Since ETRs are not required to keep track of remote ITRs that have<br>&nbsp;  cached their mappings, they do not know which ITRs need to have their<br>&nbsp;  mappings updated.&nbsp; As a result, an ETR will solicit Map-Requests<br>&nbsp;  (called an SMR message) to those sites to which it has been sending<br>&nbsp;  LISP encapsulated data packets for the last minute.&nbsp; In particular,<br>&nbsp;  an ETR will send an SMR to an ITR to which it has recently sent<br>&nbsp;  encapsulated data.&nbsp; This can only occur when both ITR and ETR<br>&nbsp;  functionality reside in the same router.<br><br>I still think that this text is needlessly confusing about which action is<br>taken by which router, and could be improved as, e.g., "this can only occur<br>when the ETR also provides ITR functionality (that is, it is an xTR)".<br><br>&nbsp;  The following procedure shows how an SMR exchange occurs when a site<br>&nbsp;  is doing Locator-Set compaction for an EID-to-RLOC mapping:<br><br>Where is locator-set compaction defined?<br><br>Throughout this whole example, "the site with the changed mapping" and "the<br>site that sent the Map-Request" are kind of clunky phrases; it might be<br>cleaner writing to give them names (like "site A" and "site B").<br><br>&nbsp;  messages.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that the SMR sender rate-limits Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request for the same destination RLOC to no more than one packet per<br>&nbsp;  3 seconds.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that the SMR responder rate-limits Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request for the same EID-Prefix to no more than once per 3 seconds.<br><br>Please double-check that "SMR sender"/"SMR responder" and "Map-Request"<br>usage are consistent/as-intended.<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; A remote ITR that receives the SMR message will schedule sending<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a Map-Request message to the source locator address of the SMR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  message or to the mapping database system.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>How does the ITR decide which destination to send the Map-Request to?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  copied from the SMR message.&nbsp; If the source Locator is the only<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Locator in the cached Locator-Set, the remote ITR SHOULD send a<br> <br>just to double-check: this is the source Locator from the SMR?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Request to the database mapping system just in case the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  single Locator has changed and may no longer be reachable to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  accept the Map-Request.<br><br>Is this the only case that the Map-Request would go to the mapping system?<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The remote ITR MUST rate-limit the Map-Request until it gets a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Reply while continuing to use the cached mapping.&nbsp; When<br><br>nit: I suggest a comma after "Map-Reply" to avoid the misparse that the<br>Map-Reply must be received while the cached mapping is in use (and that the<br>rate limiting would continue indefinitely if the cached mapping expired in<br>the meantime).<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; The ETRs at the site with the changed mapping record the fact<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that the site that sent the Map-Request has received the new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mapping data in the Map-Cache entry for the remote site so the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Locator-Status-Bits are reflective of the new mapping for packets<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  going to the remote site.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>The Locator-Status-Bits in which direction?&nbsp; (Probably should also give a<br>section ref to 6830bis for the definition.)&nbsp; It might also be appropriate to<br>discuss the interaction with the relevant map version.<br><br>&nbsp;  For security reasons, an ITR MUST NOT process unsolicited Map-<br>&nbsp;  Replies.&nbsp; To avoid Map-Cache entry corruption by a third party, a<br>&nbsp;  sender of an SMR-based Map-Request MUST be verified.&nbsp; If an ITR<br><br>To be clear, the verification here is essentially return-routability<br>verification, aka proof that the sender actually owns the claimed address,<br>right?&nbsp;

 Locator-Set for the stored Map-Cache entry, then the responding Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request MUST be sent with an EID destination to the mapping database<br>&nbsp;  system.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>What is an "SMR-based Map-Request" (also appears in the next paragraph and<br>one other place)?&nbsp; Is it just an SMR?&nbsp; If it's some actual Map-Request, I'm<br>confused at why an *I*TR would be receiving it.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; An ITR may receive an ICMP Port Unreachable message from a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  destination host.&nbsp; This occurs if an ITR attempts to use<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  interworking [<a href="/doc/rfc6832/">RFC6832</a>] and LISP-encapsulated data is sent to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  non-LISP-capable site.<br><br>Is the ITR supposed to conclude that the RLOC is likely down in this<br>situation?<br><br>&nbsp;  When ITRs receive ICMP Network Unreachable or Host Unreachable<br>&nbsp;  messages as a method to determine unreachability, they will refrain<br>&nbsp;  from using Locators that are described in Locator lists of Map-<br>&nbsp;  Replies.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is this really as precise as it can be?&nbsp; It kind of sounds like it says<br>that all Map-Replies will be ignored when any ICMP Network/Host Unreachable<br>message is received.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If it does not find one and BGP is running in the Default-<br>&nbsp;  Free Zone (DFZ), it can decide to not use the Locator even though the<br><br>Is running in the DFZ consistent with the reduced scope of running in a<br>single administrative domain?<br><br>&nbsp;  Optionally, an ITR can send a Map-Request to a Locator, and if a Map-<br>&nbsp;  Reply is returned, reachability of the Locator has been determined.<br><br>Is this describing the same flow as item (5) above and Section 7.1 below?<br>If so, it seems totally redundant and could be omitted.<br><br>&nbsp;  Obviously, sending such probes increases the number of control<br>&nbsp;  messages originated by Tunnel Routers for active flows, so Locators<br>&nbsp;  are assumed to be reachable when they are advertised.<br><br>I'm not sure what "advertised" is intended to mean, here.&nbsp; Is it<br>"advertised into the mapping system"?&nbsp; But that is not directly visible to<br>the ITR, only indirectly through the results of an actual mapping request<br>(and even then, the Map-Reply from an ETR could be invalid, e.g.,<br>overclaiming, unless LISP-SEC is used.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Both Requests and Replies MUST be rate-<br>&nbsp;  limited.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I believe this requirement duplicates requirements already made elsewhere;<br>the other locations also include more guidance on actual rates.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 ETRs MAY have anycast RLOC addresses which are registered as part of<br>&nbsp;  their RLOC-set to the mapping system.&nbsp; However, registrations MUST<br>&nbsp;  use their unique RLOC addresses or distinct authentication keys to<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Map-Register message is vulnerable to replay attacks by a<br>&nbsp;  man-in-the-middle.&nbsp; A compromised ETR can overclaim the prefix it<br>&nbsp;  owns and successfully register it on its corresponding Map-Server.<br>&nbsp;  To mitigate this and as noted in Section 8.2, a Map-Server SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  verify that all EID-Prefixes registered by an ETR match the<br>&nbsp;  configuration stored on the Map-Server.<br><br>The conversion of the Map-Register 'Nonce' field into a sequence number<br>provides some moderate remediation against the replay attack;

In<br>particular, I believe there is a nontrivial chance that either or both of<br>lisp-sec and 6834bis could require changes to this document in order to be<br>fit for purpose, and thus that this document cannot safely be approved for<br>publication until these normative dependencies are closer to publication.<br>In particular, I have done a fairly full review of lisp-sec and have<br>DISCUSS-worthy points with it (I have not done much review of 6834bis yet).<br><br>This document includes a mechansism to use HMAC keyed by a pre-shared key<br>to authenticate messages (Map-Register and Map-Notify*); it is directly<br>using the long-term PSK as the HMAC key.&nbsp; This is not really consistent<br>with current IETF best practices (e.g,. <a href="/doc/bcp107/">BCP 107</a>), which tend to not use the<br>long-term key directly for keying messages, but rather to incorporate some<br>form of key derivation step, to protect the long-term key from<br>cryptanalysis and reduce the need to track long-term per-key data usage<br>limits.&nbsp; It is probably not feasible to directly require all LISP<br>implementations to switch keying strategy, but it seems quite advisable to<br>define new algorithm ID types that include a key derivation step before the<br>HMAC, and to begin efforts to convert the ecosystem to the more sustainable<br>cryptographic usage.&nbsp; I would like to discuss what actions are reasonable<br>to take at this time, on this front.<br><br>As implied by my previous discuss ballot position, I think Section 5.4<br>should grow a statement (akin to the one added in Section 5.6) that the<br>"Record" format is also used in the "Map-Reply Record" field of the<br>Map-Request message, and that the field definitions are reused wholesale<br>for the Map-Register message.<br><br>In Section 5.6, this text seems internally inconsistent:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can continue using an incrementing nonce.&nbsp; If the the ETR cannot<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; support saving the nonce, then when it restarts it MUST use a new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authentication key to register to the mapping system.&nbsp; A Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Server MUST track and save in persistent storage the last nonce<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; received for each ETR xTR-ID that registers to it.&nbsp; If a Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Register is received with a nonce value that is not greater than<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the saved nonce, it drops the Map-Register message and logs the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fact a replay attack could have occurred.<br><br>In order for a new key to be useful as stated, the Map-Server must do the<br>nonce tracking per&nbsp; pair and not just per xTR-ID.<br><br>Also, guidance is needed on what scope of uniqueness is needed for the Key<br>ID to function properly -- unique per Map-Server?&nbsp; Per <br>pair?&nbsp; Per LISP domain?<br><br>Also in Section 5.6:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Implementations of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specification MUST include support for either HMAC-SHA-1-96<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc2404/">RFC2404</a>] and HMAC-SHA-256-128 [<a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC4868</a>] where the latter is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RECOMMENDED.<br><br>I don't think this sort of "mandatory to choose" is <a href="/doc/bcp201/">BCP 201</a>-compliant.<br><br>I think there needs to be more description of Site-ID usage and scoping in<br>order to be fully interoperable (more in the COMMENT section).<br><br>There are multiple places where we talk about message contents being copied<br>from a corresponding request (e.g., from Map-Request to Map-Notify); we<br>need to explicitly state that the authentication data is recomputed to<br>match, e.g., the new message type.&nbsp; I've tried to note these occurrences in<br>the COMMENT section.<br><br>The condition for Map-Notify-Ack terminating Map-Notify retransmission<br>seems incomplete (more in the COMMENT).<br><br>In Section 8.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A Map-Register message includes<br>&nbsp;  authentication data, so prior to sending a Map-Register message, the<br>&nbsp;  ETR and Map-Server SHOULD be configured with a shared secret or other<br>&nbsp;  relevant authentication information.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>We require authentication for Map-Register and do not provide any<br>alternative mechanism for key distribution, so why is this only a SHOULD?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As developers<br>&nbsp;  and operators gain experience with the mapping system, additional,<br>&nbsp;  stronger security measures may be added to the registration process.<br><br>This text does not add confidence to the "proposed standard" label.<br><br>In Section 9:<br><br>&nbsp;  A complete LISP threat analysis can be found in [<a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC7835</a>].&nbsp; In what<br><br>As I have stated previously, the threat analysis in <a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC 7835</a> is not<br>complete and it should not be referred to as such.<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; LISP-SEC [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-sec/">I-D.ietf-lisp-sec</a>] MUST be implemented.&nbsp; Network<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  operartors should carefully weight how the LISP-SEC threat model<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  applies to their particular use case or deployment.&nbsp; If they<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  decide to ignore a particular recommendation, they should make<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sure the risk associated with the corresponding threats is well<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  understood.<br><br>I'm concerned enough about the risk of having a "ITR requests lisp-sec but<br>ETR didn't use it" case that causes complete breakage, that I want to talk<br>about this a bit more.&nbsp; We currently in this document say that lisp-sec is<br>mandatory to implement (which presumably covers at least ITRs, ETRs,<br>Map-Resolvers, and Map-Servers).&nbsp; LISP-SEC itself says that "and ETR that<br>supports LISP-SEC MUST set the S bit in its Map-Register messages".&nbsp; Is it<br>possible that an ETR might "implement" but then not "support" LISP-SEC?&nbsp; If<br>so, then we should consider the possibility that we need an authenticated<br>signal (from the mapping system to the ITR) that downgrading from lisp-sec<br>is allowed.&nbsp; There seem to be several possibilities for how one might<br>construct such a signal; two that came to mind to me would be (1) to define a<br>new ACT value for "repeat without lisp-sec" that could be returned as a<br>negative Map-Response directly from the mapping system wherever the mapping<br>system is able to discern that the ETR in question does not support<br>lisp-sec (I don't actually know if this could happen at Map-Resolver or<br>would need to be delayed until the final Map-Server) and (2) to have an<br>optional Map-Request field that the ETR is required to copy unchanged to<br>the Map-Reply; this could then include a message HMAC'd in the ITR-OTK that<br>indicates lisp-sec non-support and binds to the nonce in the request.<br>Whether these are workable ideas seems to depend on aspects of the mapping<br>system to which I cannot speak.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The LISP-SEC<br>&nbsp;  protocol defines a mechanism for providing origin authentication,<br>&nbsp;  integrity, anti-replay, protection, and prevention of 'man-in-the-<br>&nbsp;  middle' and 'prefix overclaiming' attacks on the Map-Request/Map-<br>&nbsp;  Reply exchange.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Does LISP-SEC actually provide any additional anti-replay protection not<br>present in the base protocol?&nbsp; I do not remember any such additional<br>protection.<br><br>&nbsp;  A complete LISP threat analysis has been published in [<a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC7835</a>].<br>&nbsp;  Please refer to it for more detailed security related details.<br><br>(1) you already said that above, (2) it's still not complete.<br><br>Section 11 ("Changes since <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>") is inaccurate (see COMMENT).&nbsp; I did<br>not check whether it is complete, but someone needs to do so before final<br>publication.<br><br><br>The following items were present in my original DISCUSS position and still<br>have not been resolved.&nbsp; Note that I copy below the previous ballot text<br>even for some issues that are described above already in different words.<br><br>A 64-bit nonce is used, apparently as a request/response correlator, but<br>the actual (cryptographic?) properties required from the nonce in the<br>protocol are not clearly covered.&nbsp; In some cryptographic contexts a 64-bit<br>nonce may be too short; I do not believe that this is the case here, but<br>without a clear picture of what the requirements are it's hard to say for<br>sure.&nbsp; <br>[ed. there was some previous discussion about 24-bit nonces that has been<br>removed from the text, but the core question of what properties the nonce<br>is required to provide remains unaddressed in the document text.&nbsp; There is<br>also a field called 'Nonce' that is used as a s equence number, the<br>requirements for which are partially described in the new text.]<br><br>The layout of the document is somewhat confusing, in a way that could<br>arguably lead to noninteroperable implemnetations.&nbsp; For example, the<br>section on the Map-Register message format includes descriptions of the<br>fields in the records and locators therein, and the section on Map-Notify<br>reuses that portion of the structure, incorporating the field descriptions<br>by reference.&nbsp; But the Map-Register section does not indicate that its<br>descriptions are to apply in both cases, leading to confusing text that<br>talks about values being set or cases that are not possible for a<br>Map-Register (i.e., the section nominally being described).&nbsp; It would be<br>most clear to have a dedicated subsection for the portion of the<br>structure(s) that is being reused, which would allow for the per-field<br>descriptions to clearly indicate in which scope they are defined.&nbsp; But the<br>more minimal change of just indicating that the primary definition will be<br>"dual use" would probably suffice as well.<br>The Map-Reply record/locator descriptions are reused similarly; I made a<br>comment on section 5.4 that lists a specific instance, though I believe the<br>phenomenon is more general.<br>[ed. this was partially addressed, but the request to examine all data<br>structure reuse (note that "for example" was used) was not heeded]<br><br>Similarly, there are many instances (some noted in my Comment) where a<br>bidirectional interaction between two xTRs is described, yet the peers are<br>identified as "ITR" and "ETR".&nbsp; This is very confusing when the entity<br>named as "ITR" is described as performing ETR functionality, or vice versa;<br>pedagogically, it would be much better to use non-role-based names for the<br>entities while describing these exchanges.<br>[ed. there was some improvement here; I still note some potential sites for<br>confusion in the COMMENT]<br><br>While I see that there is an entire document dedicated to Map-Versioning<br>and thus we do not need to fully cover everything here, I think it is<br>critically important to be clear that there are consistency requirements<br>attached to map versions, as relating to the stability of membership of<br>RLOCs in a given record, etc.&nbsp; (I cannot be very clear hear since I am not<br>entirely confident of the details of the consistency requirements yet.)<br><br>I think we need greater clarity on the 'E' and 'M' bits in the ECM format;<br>more in the Comment section.<br>[ed. the reader will need to consult the original ballot's COMMENT section<br>and not the current one]<br><br>Section 8.1 says:<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A Negative Map-Reply, with action code of "Natively-Forward", from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Map-Server that is authoritative for an EID-Prefix that matches<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the requested EID but that does not have an actively registered,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more-specific ID-prefix.<br>This document provides no mechanism to establish that a Map-Server is<br>authoritative for a given EID-Prefix, so this entire case is<br>non-actionable.<br>[ed. I think there may have been some previous discussion on this (e.g.,<br>that might render it moot) but couldn't find it quickly]<br><br>Section 8.2 says:<br>&nbsp;  An ETR publishes its EID-Prefixes on a Map-Server by sending LISP<br>&nbsp;  Map-Register messages.&nbsp; A Map-Register message includes<br>&nbsp;  authentication data, so prior to sending a Map-Register message, the<br>&nbsp;  ETR and Map-Server SHOULD be configured with a shared secret or other<br>&nbsp;  relevant authentication information.<br>This cannot be a SHOULD if things are to work properly; it has to be MUST.<br><br>Section 8.2 also says:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As developers<br>&nbsp;  and operators gain experience with the mapping system, additional,<br>&nbsp;  stronger security measures may be added to the registration process.<br>This kind of language for forward-looking guidance indicates that the<br>current security properties are not well-understood by the authors and is<br>inconsistent with Proposed Standard status.<br><br>I think the MUST and SHOULD requirements for implementing cryptographic<br>primitives are generally swapped; the more-secure ones (e.g.,<br>HMAC-SHA-256-128) should be MUST, and the legacy algorithms needed for<br>compatibility with existing deployments would be SHOULD.<br><br>Section 9 currently states:<br>&nbsp;  [a]s noted in Section 8.2, a Map-Server SHOULD verify that all EID-<br>&nbsp;  Prefixes registered by an ETR match the configuration stored on the<br>&nbsp;  Map-Server.<br>I think we need a MUST-level requirement for verifying authorization for a<br>given EID-Prefix, with one way of satisfying the requirement being checking<br>configuration, but allowing for other means as well.</div></td>

 mappings updated.&nbsp; As a result, an ETR will solicit Map-Requests<br>&nbsp;  (called an SMR message) to those sites to which it has been sending<br>&nbsp;  LISP encapsulated data packets for the last minute.&nbsp; In particular,<br>&nbsp;  an ETR will send an SMR to an ITR to which it has recently sent<br>&nbsp;  encapsulated data.&nbsp; This can only occur when both ITR and ETR<br>&nbsp;  functionality reside in the same router.<br><br>I still think that this text is needlessly confusing about which action is<br>taken by which router, and could be improved as, e.g., "this can only occur<br>when the ETR also provides ITR functionality (that is, it is an xTR)".<br><br>&nbsp;

I do not believe that these documents<br>have adequate security to advance to Proposed Standard.<br><br>I thought it might be helpful for me to lay out my starting<br>assumptions and threat model and what I think the appropriate standard<br>is here. That gives us an opportunity to discuss them prior to<br>getting into the specific security issues I raise below.<br><br><br>SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE<br>Per offline discussion, I understand that despite some of the<br>introductory material, LISP is not currently intended to be Internet<br>scale but rather to run in what seem to be fairly tightly controlled<br>environments. Thus, I am assuming the following facts about<br>the system:<br><br>- The Mapping Service itself is secure and trusted.&nbsp; For the purposed<br>&nbsp; of this discussion, I'm modelling all the entities in the services<br>&nbsp; as one trusted element.<br><br>- The ETRs have a preconfigured relationship with the Mapping Service,<br>&nbsp; which includes some sort of shared key and an ACL on the Mapping<br>&nbsp; Service which tells it which EIDs anm ETR can advertise. How<br>&nbsp; this gets established is out of scope of this discussion.<br><br>Note that neither of these assumptions would be reasonable in<br>an Internet scale system, but I'm assuming that the text about<br>that in these documents will be removed.<br><br>Because it's not in the document set before us, nor is it a normative<br>reference, I am disregarding LISP-SEC and only analyzing the system as<br>specified in these documents.<br><br><br>THREAT MODEL<br>I'm assuming the usual <a href="/doc/rfc3552/">RFC 3552</a> threat model, I.e.,<br><br>- All non-Map Server elements in the system (specifically, endpoints<br>&nbsp; and the xTRs are potentially malicious).<br>&nbsp; <br>- Aside from the links between the Map Server elements, the network<br>&nbsp; is controlled by the attacker.<br><br>Against this background, my expectation is that the attacker<br>should not be able to affect traffic in any fashion significantly<br>more effective than tampering with the data plane. For instance,<br>it's clearly the case that an on-path attacker between two xTRs<br>can drop all the packets or forward them to some third xTR, but<br>it should not be able to send a small number of packets which<br>would then affect the routing of a large number of packets.<br><br>I do not expect that the data plane should have better security<br>than native (non-IPsec) traffic. Given the nature of LISP and<br>the existence of a mapping system, it seems like it's kind of<br>a missed opportunity to deploy a credentials system that would<br>support IPsec-style data plane security, but given that this<br>isn't a generally safe assumption for IP traffic, and therefore<br>you need to provide some sort of transport or application security<br>anyway, I don't think it's the right standard to hold LISP to.<br><br><br>ATTACKS<br>LISP appears to be vulnerable to a number of routing attacks that<br>I claim above it should not be subject to. For example:<br><br>1. An on-path attacker can forge Map Replys to the ITR,<br>&nbsp;  thus redirecting traffic.<br><br>2. An ETR can perform an "overclaiming" attack in which it<br>&nbsp;  claims to be responsible for EIDs which it is not actually<br>&nbsp;  responsible for.<br><br>3. An off-path attacker can temporarily reroute traffic by exploiting<br>&nbsp;  the "gleaning" feature to cache poison an ITR. In addition, the<br>&nbsp;  "echo noncing" feature does not appear to have a sufficiently strong<br>&nbsp;  nonce to protect against forgery, and thus turning this into a<br>&nbsp;  long-term attack<br><br>4. An attacker may be able to perform a number of cache invalidation<br>&nbsp;  and contamination attacks by exploiting the Map-Version and<br>&nbsp;  Locator-Status bits. This may lead to DoS.<br><br>5. An attacker who was at time T responsible for an EID block<br>&nbsp;  can probably prolong its ability to respond for that block<br>&nbsp;  even after it is no longer responsible.<br>&nbsp; <br>6. A number of the components appear to be subject to various replay<br>&nbsp;  attacks.<br><br>I note that many of these attacks are documented in the Security<br>Considerations for these documents. Also, I doubt this list is<br>exhaustive. As noted above, I have spent no time on the data plane<br>protocol.<br><br><br>DEFENSES<br>When looking at attacks, it's important to determine whether there are<br>plausible defenses. For most of these, I believe that the answer is<br>"yes", at varying levels of cost. As noted above, LISP-SEC appears to<br>be intended to address a number of these issues, so it's possible that<br>requiring LISP-SEC would go a fair ways towards addressing these<br>issues. A cursory look at LISP-SEC turns up some somewhat concerning<br>design choices, so I would have to examine it more closely to give a<br>real opinion.<br><br>I do not believe that LISP-SEC will address the attacks that do not<br>involve the Mapping Server. For instance, the gleaning<br>contamination/nonce attacks (3) would not appear to be fixed by<br>LISP-SEC. However, it's probably possible to fix them by lengthening<br>the nonce.<br><br>With that said, I tend to think that the overall authentication<br>architecture here would benefit from a rethink. At a high level, the<br>source of most of these problems is the "non-transferability" of the<br>mapping information from the Map Server. If the Map Server instead had<br>an asymmetric key pair which it used to sign mappings, then almost all<br>of these attacks would not work.

In particular, the ITR is required<br>to discard non-secure responses, which is necessary in order to avoid a<br>downgrade attack (in the current architecture).&nbsp; However, it seems that<br>ETRs are not required to enable security in their registrations, and<br>Map-Servers are supposed to strip the security flag when forwarding<br>Map-Requests to ETRs that do not register as supporting LISP-SEC, and the<br>resulting Map-Reply messages would thus not be secured, and dropped by the<br>initiating ITR.&nbsp; So support for LISP-SEC would need to be mandatory for all<br>ETRs in order for any ITR to be able to enforce the downgrade-protection<br>behavior, which is a pretty bad deployment story.&nbsp; Making LISP-SEC<br>mandatory everywhere would, of course, avoid this issue.<br><br>I do not understand the procedure for allocation of EIDs.&nbsp; In a global<br>mapping database, there needs to be some authoritative procedure for<br>determining what ETRs and/or Map-Servers are authoritative for a given<br>subset of EID space.&nbsp; All I've seen so far to do this effectively boils<br>down to manual configuration, whether explicitly on a Map-Server or just as<br>a mapping of what keys are authorized to advertise which EIDs.<br><br>A 64-bit (or in some cases 24-bit) nonce is used, apparently as a<br>request/response correlator, but the actual (cryptographic?) properties<br>required from the nonce in the protocol are not clearly covered.&nbsp; In some<br>cryptographic contexts a 64-bit nonce may be too short; I do not believe<br>that this is the case here, but without a clear picture of what the<br>requirements are it's hard to say for sure.&nbsp; 24 bits, on the other hand, is<br>quite small.<br><br>The layout of the document is somewhat confusing, in a way that could<br>arguably lead to noninteroperable implemnetations.&nbsp; For example, the<br>section on the Map-Register message format includes descriptions of the<br>fields in the records and locators therein, and the section on Map-Notify<br>reuses that portion of the structure, incorporating the field descriptions<br>by reference.&nbsp; But the Map-Register section does not indicate that its<br>descriptions are to apply in both cases, leading to confusing text that<br>talks about values being set or cases that are not possible for a<br>Map-Register (i.e., the section nominally being described).&nbsp; It would be<br>most clear to have a dedicated subsection for the portion of the<br>structure(s) that is being reused, which would allow for the per-field<br>descriptions to clearly indicate in which scope they are defined.&nbsp; But the<br>more minimal change of just indicating that the primary definition will be<br>"dual use" would probably suffice as well.<br>The Map-Reply record/locator descriptions are reused similarly; I made a<br>comment on section 5.4 that lists a specific instance, though I believe the<br>phenomenon is more general.<br><br>Similarly, there are many instances (some noted in my Comment) where a<br>bidirectional interaction between two xTRs is described, yet the peers are<br>identified as "ITR" and "ETR".&nbsp; This is very confusing when the entity<br>named as "ITR" is described as performing ETR functionality, or vice versa;<br>pedagogically, it would be much better to use non-role-based names for the<br>entities while describing these exchanges.<br><br>While I see that there is an entire document dedicated to Map-Versioning<br>and thus we do not need to fully cover everything here, I think it is<br>critically important to be clear that there are consistency requirements<br>attached to map versions, as relating to the stability of membership of<br>RLOCs in a given record, etc.&nbsp; (I cannot be very clear hear since I am not<br>entirely confident of the details of the consistency requirements yet.)<br><br>The Map-Register message format field descriptions includes:<br>&nbsp;  Nonce:&nbsp; This 8-octet 'Nonce' field is set to 0 in Map-Register<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages if no Map-Notify message is expected to acknowledge it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the Map-Register message is authenticated, the 'Nonce' field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is not currently used for any security function but may be in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; future as part of an anti-replay solution.<br>Having the map registrations subject to replay seems like a critical flaw<br>that would allow an attacker to disrupt any sort of mobility situation,<br>even in the presence of LISP-SEC.&nbsp; I cannot see how this protocol could be<br>suitable for Proposed Standard status with such a susceptibility to replay.<br><br>I think we need more details on the expected Map-Register/Map-Notify and<br>Map-Notify/Map-Notify-Ack message flows.&nbsp; In what cases is the ack not<br>needed, and why?<br><br>I think we need greater clarity on the 'E' and 'M' bits in the ECM format;<br>more in the Comment section.<br><br>I am concerned that the extensibility mechanism for ECM encapsulation is<br>insufficiently well specified.&nbsp; Is a registry needed?&nbsp; Will new message<br>types need to Update: this document to indicate the extension?&nbsp; What<br>attributes make a message (un)suitable for encapsulation?<br><br>Section 8.1 says:<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A Negative Map-Reply, with action code of "Natively-Forward", from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a Map-Server that is authoritative for an EID-Prefix that matches<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the requested EID but that does not have an actively registered,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more-specific ID-prefix.<br>This document provides no mechanism to establish that a Map-Server is<br>authoritative for a given EID-Prefix, so this entire case is<br>non-actionable.<br><br>Section 8.2 says:<br>&nbsp;  An ETR publishes its EID-Prefixes on a Map-Server by sending LISP<br>&nbsp;  Map-Register messages.&nbsp; A Map-Register message includes<br>&nbsp;  authentication data, so prior to sending a Map-Register message, the<br>&nbsp;  ETR and Map-Server SHOULD be configured with a shared secret or other<br>&nbsp;  relevant authentication information.<br>This cannot be a SHOULD if things are to work properly; it has to be MUST.<br><br>Section 8.2 also says:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As developers<br>&nbsp;  and operators gain experience with the mapping system, additional,<br>&nbsp;  stronger security measures may be added to the registration process.<br>This kind of language for forward-looking guidance indicates that the<br>current security properties are not well-understood by the authors and is<br>inconsistent with Proposed Standard status.<br><br>Perhaps I am misunderstanding the desired behavior but when Section 8.4<br>says:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  To do this, it forwards the unencapsulated Map-Request,<br>&nbsp;  with the original ITR RLOC as the source, to the mapping database<br>&nbsp;  system.&nbsp; [...]<br>doesn't this carry substantial risk of running afoul of <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> filtering?<br><br>I think the MUST and SHOULD requirements for implementing cryptographic<br>primitives are generally swapped; the more-secure ones (e.g.,<br>HMAC-SHA-256-128) should be MUST, and the legacy algorithms needed for<br>compatibility with existing deployments would be SHOULD.<br><br>Section 9 currently states:<br>&nbsp;  [a]s noted in Section 8.2, a Map-Server SHOULD verify that all EID-<br>&nbsp;  Prefixes registered by an ETR match the configuration stored on the<br>&nbsp;  Map-Server.<br>I think we need a MUST-level requirement for verifying authorization for a<br>given EID-Prefix, with one way of satisfying the requirement being checking<br>configuration, but allowing for other means as well.<br><br>In the -15, Section 9 also stated:<br>&nbsp;  The currently defined authentication mechanism for Map-Register<br>&nbsp;  messages does not provide protection against "replay" attacks by a<br>&nbsp;  "man-in-the-middle".&nbsp; Additional work is needed in this area.<br>I don't understand how this sort of statement can be present in a document<br>targetting Proposed Standard status, in effect admitting that there are<br>grave deficiencies in the security posture of the protocol.&nbsp; The -16 has<br>gained some language indicating that LISP-SEC mitigates many attacks in<br>this space, but that is hardly of much use when LISP-SEC is not a mandatory<br>protocol feature.<br><br>I'm disappointed that there is no Privacy Considerations section, though<br>given that <a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC 7835</a> seems to attempt to disclaim privacy considerations<br>entirely, perhaps I should not be surprised.&nbsp; Tying devices to persistent<br>Endpoint IDentifiers and using them in mobility situations inherently<br>raises privacy concerns.&nbsp; These are not necessarily fatal to a protocol,<br>but they do need to be discussed and the benefits weighed against the<br>costs.</div></td>

there are<br>a lot of them and I was focusing my time more on trying to understand the<br>broader system, and the intended security posture, so they did not get as<br>much clean-up as I would have liked.<br><br>Map-Reply will typically forward a packet that got a negative reply<br>onto the public internet, adding extra latency to all flows through<br>a LISP-enabled ITR; is that correct?<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note this document doesn't assume any particular database mapping<br>&nbsp;  infrastructure to illustrate certain aspects of Map-Server and Map-<br>&nbsp;  Resolver operation, the Mapping Service interface can (and likely<br>&nbsp;  will) be used by ITRs and ETRs to access other mapping database<br>&nbsp;  systems as the LISP infrastructure evolves.<br><br>nit: This looks like a comma splice, though I'm not sure I'm parsing everything<br>correctly.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>Use the actual boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>; don't just tack on a new<br>reference to the existing (and without errata fix!) <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> boilerplate.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Should the Map-Register message's definition also mention that the<br>Map-Server returns the registered RLOCs in normal Map-Replys?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  A Map-Server is a device that publishes EID-Prefixes in a LISP<br>&nbsp;  mapping database on behalf of a set of ETRs.&nbsp; When it receives a Map<br>&nbsp;  Request (typically from an ITR), it consults the mapping database to<br>&nbsp;  find an ETR that can answer with the set of RLOCs for an EID-Prefix.<br><br>My understanding from the intro document, etc., was that the ITR generally<br>was not sending Map-Requests directly to Map-Servers, and that rather there<br>was some triangle routing, with the Map-Request going from ITR to<br>Map-Resolver to Map-Server, and the Map-Reply directly from Map-Server to<br>ITR (so "typically one initiated by an ITR" or similar).&nbsp; It's also odd<br>language (to me) to have the Map-Server "consult the mapping database" when<br>the Map-Server comprises part of the mapping database and has local<br>authoritative data.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>Are we really just duplicating the IPv4+UDP and IPv6+UDP packet headers<br>here?<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Values in the "Not Assigned" range can be assigned according to<br>&nbsp;  procedures in [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a>].&nbsp; Documents that request for a new LISP<br>&nbsp;  packet type may indicate a preferred value.<br><br>8126 has lots of procedures; generally we use a name to indicate which one<br>is to be followed.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>Using the same letter with different case for different flag bits sounds<br>confusing.<br><br>Lots of potential fun tampering with these flag bits, whether downgrade<br>attacks on features or otherwise mucking around.<br><br>Source EID address in Map-Request has privacy considerations.<br><br>If the multiple ITR-RLOC Addresses is soleyl "to give the ETR the option of<br>selecting the destination address from any address family" then there<br>should be a restriction to one ITR address per AFI.&nbsp; (But it's not, so this<br>text should be tweaked to avoid suggesting that it is.)<br><br>When an EID mask-len smaller than the full length of the given address type<br>is used, what are the values of the bits in the EID-Prefix field that are<br>"masked away"?&nbsp; Leaving unspecified bits like this makes for an easy covert<br>channel, especially so when the protocol messages are not covered by any<br>integrity protection scheme and subject to on-path tampering.<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A Map-Request is sent from an ITR when it needs a mapping for an EID,<br>&nbsp;  wants to test an RLOC for reachability, or wants to refresh a mapping<br>&nbsp;  before TTL expiration.&nbsp; For the initial case, the destination IP<br>&nbsp;  address used for the Map-Request is the data packet's destination<br>&nbsp;  address (i.e., the destination EID) that had a mapping cache lookup<br>&nbsp;  failure.&nbsp; For the latter two cases, the destination IP address used<br>&nbsp;  for the Map-Request is one of the RLOC addresses from the Locator-Set<br>&nbsp;  of the Map-Cache entry.<br><br>I seem to be confused by the "destination IP address" bits here.<br>Are we really sending Map-Request UDPgrams from an ITR to the EID<br>destination address that we failed to look up, hoping that some magic in<br>the network will cause it to end up at an ETR or Map-Server that can reply?<br>Or is this talking about how we set the EID-Prefix portion of the<br>Map-Request?&nbsp; The latter two cases do seem to be using RLOCs in a way<br>that I expect, which makes me think I'm confused.<br><br>Where is the term "Map-Replier" defined?<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] If the ITR erroneously<br>&nbsp;  provides no ITR-RLOC addresses, the Map-Replier MUST drop the Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request.<br><br>It's unclear how the Map-Replier would detect this, as opposed to just<br>blindly trying to interpret the start of the request records as an<br>ITR-RLOC.<br><br>&nbsp;  An ITR that is configured with mapping database information (i.e., it<br>&nbsp;  is also an ETR) MAY optionally include those mappings in a Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request.&nbsp; When an ETR configured to accept and verify such<br>&nbsp;  "piggybacked" mapping data receives such a Map-Request and it does<br>&nbsp;  not have this mapping in the Map-Cache, it MAY originate a "verifying<br>&nbsp;  Map-Request", addressed to the map-requesting ITR and the ETR MAY add<br>&nbsp;  a Map-Cache entry. [...]<br><br>This seems like a place where naming the xTRs not by role would help<br>clarify the flows and the role in which each entity is acting, at each<br>point.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] If the ETR has a Map-Cache entry that matches the<br>&nbsp;  "piggybacked" EID and the RLOC is in the Locator-Set for the entry,<br>&nbsp;  then it MAY send the "verifying Map-Request" directly to the<br>&nbsp;  originating Map-Request source.&nbsp; If the RLOC is not in the Locator-<br>&nbsp;  Set, then the ETR MUST send the "verifying Map-Request" to the<br>&nbsp;  "piggybacked" EID.<br><br>It's probably worth disambiguating that "the RLOC" is the cached RLOC for<br>the EID in the "piggybacked" Map-Reply record.&nbsp; (Of course, there could be<br>more than one cached RLOC for a given EID, so "the" is not really right<br>anyway.)&nbsp; Similarly, "the Locator-Set" could become "the Locator-Set in the<br>piggybacked Map-Reply record".&nbsp; Additionally, and this may just be my<br>confusion, but is "send ... to the piggybacked EID" the right terminology?<br>In my mental model at least, "perform a fresh mapping lookup for the EID in<br>order to send a verifying Map-Request" would be better.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>'S' bit, so clearing that bit and dropping the AD trailer allows an<br>attacker to modify the contents.&nbsp; We would perhaps only saved by the bit in<br>6830bis where if you ask for a secure resolution you have to get one back,<br>but that's not deployable.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nonce:&nbsp; This is a 24-bit value set in a Data-Probe<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a>] or a 64-bit value from the Map-Request<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is echoed in this 'Nonce' field of the Map-Reply.&nbsp; When a 24-bit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value is supplied, it resides in the low-order 64 bits of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Nonce' field.<br><br>Just a 6830bis reference isn't quite enough to describe this case, I think;<br>don't you need to say that the other 40 bits are used by the mapping<br>implementation?<br><br>In the ACT field, is the "No-Action" value ever used for Negative<br>Map-Replies?&nbsp; If so, I'm confused what the semantics are supposed to be.<br><br>Differentiating between Drop/policy and Drop/authentication may open up<br>a side channel for an attacker to learn about authentication or policy<br>information.&nbsp; (But maybe not; this needs more analysis)<br><br>&nbsp;  A: The Authoritative bit, when sent, is always set to 1 by an ETR.<br><br>What does "when sent" mean?&nbsp; The field is part of the structure; it's<br>always sent.&nbsp; Or is this supposed to be "has value 1 if and only if the<br>Map-Reply is sent by an ETR"?<br><br>The EID-Prefix entry should probably reuse (or refer to) the text from the<br>Map-Request field, covering length for other AFIs.<br>Also, say what goes on for the bits that are "masked out".<br><br>I feel like perhaps less could be said about the 'M' priority and weight<br>fields, as what's currently there just leaves me confused about ETR vs. ITR<br>vs. xTR and how this information flow is consumed.<br><br>&nbsp;  p: When this bit is set, an ETR informs the RLOC-Probing ITR that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; locator address for which this bit is set is the one being RLOC-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; probed and may be different from the source address of the Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reply.&nbsp; An ITR that RLOC-probes a particular Locator MUST use this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Locator for retrieving the data structure used to store the fact<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that the Locator is reachable.&nbsp; The p-bit is set for a single<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Locator in the same Locator-Set. If an implementation sets more<br><br>Exactly one or at most one?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than one p-bit erroneously, the receiver of the Map-Reply MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; select the first Locator.&nbsp; The p-bit MUST NOT be set for Locator-<br><br>First overall or first that sets the p bit?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set records sent in Map-Request and Map-Register messages.<br><br>&nbsp;  Locator:&nbsp; This is an IPv4 or IPv6 address (as encoded by the 'Loc-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AFI' field) assigned to an ETR.&nbsp; Note that the destination RLOC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address MAY be an anycast address.&nbsp; A source RLOC can be an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anycast address as well.&nbsp; The source or destination RLOC MUST NOT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be the broadcast address (255.255.255.255 or any subnet broadcast<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address known to the router) and MUST NOT be a link-local<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multicast address.&nbsp; The source RLOC MUST NOT be a multicast<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address.&nbsp; The destination RLOC SHOULD be a multicast address if it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is being mapped from a multicast destination EID.<br><br>This is the section on the contents of the Map-Reply message.&nbsp; Why are we<br>talking about source RLOCs?&nbsp; Oh, we're going to refer back to this from<br>other sections for just the "EID-record" portion (a term which is not<br>properly defined).&nbsp; It would be good to mention that up front at the start<br>of this section or the list of fields in the EID-record.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  A Map-Request for EID 2001:db8:1:5::5 would cause a Map-Reply with a<br>&nbsp;  record count of 3 to be returned with mapping records for EID-<br>&nbsp;  Prefixes 2001:db8:1::/24, 2001:db8:1:1::/32, 2001:db8:1:2::/32.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp;  filling out the /24 with more-specifics that exist in the mapping<br>&nbsp;  system.<br><br>nit: This last sentence is a sentence fragment.<br><br>Requiring numerical sort of the locators seems to make the "inserted in<br>the middle" case very difficult to reason about, especially relating to<br>synchronization with the data plane and LSBs in data-plane messages.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...]&nbsp; The source address of the Map-Reply is one of<br>&nbsp;  the local IP addresses chosen to allow Unicast Reverse Path<br>&nbsp;  Forwarding (uRPF) checks to succeed in the upstream service provider.<br><br>nit: should there be a comma before "chosen"?<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>Huh, why did I think that Map-Register was always sent encapsulated?<br><br>The key-ID description is a great example of how to best describe the<br>security properties of a field;

&nbsp; &nbsp; of the MAC algorithm.&nbsp; The entire Map-Register payload is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authenticated with this field preset to 0.&nbsp; After the MAC is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; computed, it is placed in this field.&nbsp; Implementations of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specification MUST include support for HMAC-SHA-1-96 [<a href="/doc/rfc2404/">RFC2404</a>],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and support for HMAC-SHA-256-128 [<a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC4868</a>] is RECOMMENDED.<br><br>It's probably good to explictly clarify that "entire payload" means<br>"from and including the LISP message type field through the end of the last<br>record and its locators".<br>Also, the MUST/RECOMMENDED status seems backwards.<br><br>I guess referring back to Section 5.4 for the duplicated fields is probably<br>okay, but I would suggest calling out the portions that are only applicable<br>or uniquely handled for the Map-Register message.<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] An implementation SHOULD retransmit up to 3 times at 3<br>&nbsp;  second retransmission intervals, after which time the retransmission<br>&nbsp;  interval is exponentially backed-off for another 3 retransmission<br>&nbsp;  attempts.<br><br>This is underdefined without specifying the exponent base for the<br>exponential backoff.<br><br>Why is it allowed to Map-Register without requesting a Map-Notify?<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  An Encapsulated Control Message (ECM) is used to encapsulate control<br>&nbsp;  packets sent between xTRs and the mapping database system.<br><br>Please be explicit about whether all such messages are encapsulated or only<br>some of them.<br><br>&nbsp;  S:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the Security bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, the field following<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the 'Reserved' field will have the following Authentication<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 E:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the to-ETR bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, the Map-Server's<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  intention is to forward the ECM to an authoritative ETR.<br><br>I think this needs to say more about which message flows this bit is<br>defined for.&nbsp; Presumably the ITR will never use it for sending an<br>encapsulated Map-Request to a Map-Resolver, but there seem to be plenty of<br>places where ECM wrapping is used.<br><br>&nbsp;  M:&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the to-MS bit.&nbsp; When set to 1, a Map-Request is being<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sent to a co-located Map-Resolver and Map-Server where the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  message can be processed directly by the Map-Server versus the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Resolver using the LISP-DDT procedures in [<a href="/doc/rfc8111/">RFC8111</a>].<br><br>How does the sender know that its configured Map-Resolver is also a<br>Map-Server?&nbsp; It's unclear to me why this needs a bit in the message as<br>opposed to just happening based on the attributes of the receiving<br>Map-Server.<br><br>&nbsp;  LCM:&nbsp; The format is one of the control message formats described in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  this section.&nbsp; At this time, only Map-Request messages are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  allowed to be Control-Plane (ECM) encapsulated.&nbsp; In the future,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  PIM Join/Prune messages [<a href="/doc/rfc6831/">RFC6831</a>] might be allowed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Encapsulating other types of LISP control messages is for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  further study.&nbsp; When Map-Requests are sent for RLOC-Probing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  purposes (i.e., the probe-bit is set), they MUST NOT be sent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  inside Encapsulated Control Messages.<br><br>This type of forward-looking language seems unusuabl for a PS document; I<br>would expect to not see predictions on what might happen, but rather the<br>specification of what procedure is used to allow new message types.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the ETRs don't keep track of remote ITRs that have cached their<br>&nbsp;  mappings, they do not know which ITRs need to have their mappings<br>&nbsp;  updated. [...]<br><br>Nothing *prevents* ETRs from doing this tracking; they're just not required<br>to do so.&nbsp; So it would be better to say something like "Since ETRs are not<br>required to keep track of [...]".<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] In particular, an ETR will send an SMR to<br>&nbsp;  an ITR to which it has recently sent encapsulated data.&nbsp; This can<br>&nbsp;  only occur when both ITR and ETR functionality reside in the same<br>&nbsp;  router.<br><br>Having just come from the section on the "encapsulated control message",<br>perhaps the reader could use an extra hint that the "encapsulated data" is<br>just "LISP-tunneled data-plane traffic".&nbsp; Also, is this intended to be a<br>normative requirement (with the use of "will")?<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; When the database mappings in an ETR change, the ETRs at the site<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  begin to send Map-Requests with the SMR bit set for each Locator<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  in each Map-Cache entry the ETR caches.<br><br>Map-Cache is an ITR function; this is probably another case where naming<br>the routers would allow for a more clear description of the protocol<br>exchanges.&nbsp; Also, this seems in disagreement with the previous text about<br>sending data in the previous minute, since Map-Cache entries can persist<br>for longer than a minute.<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; The ETRs at the site with the changed mapping record the fact<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that the site that sent the Map-Request has received the new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  mapping data in the Map-Cache entry for the remote site so the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Locator-Status-Bits are reflective of the new mapping for packets<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  going to the remote site.&nbsp; The ETR then stops sending SMR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  messages.<br><br>Perhaps a nit, but the "site with the changed mapping" doesn't make sense<br>-- the map applies to the EID, and in principle the EID could have moved to<br>a different site.&nbsp; So this could be "the site sending SMR messages"<br>perhaps.&nbsp; Also, I think there needs to be greater clarity about which<br>Locator-Status bits are being described.&nbsp; Finally, the cessation of sending<br>SMR messages is presumably scoped to those targetted to the sender of the<br>Map-Request in question and not a global property?<br><br>&nbsp;  For security reasons, an ITR MUST NOT process unsolicited Map-<br>&nbsp;  Replies.&nbsp; To avoid Map-Cache entry corruption by a third party, a<br>&nbsp;  sender of an SMR-based Map-Request MUST be verified.&nbsp; If an ITR<br>&nbsp;  receives an SMR-based Map-Request and the source is not in the<br>&nbsp;  Locator-Set for the stored Map-Cache entry, then the responding Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request MUST be sent with an EID destination to the mapping database<br>&nbsp;  system.&nbsp; Since the mapping database system is a more secure way to<br>&nbsp;  reach an authoritative ETR, it will deliver the Map-Request to the<br>&nbsp;  authoritative source of the mapping data.<br><br>The only verification possible in this set of documents does not constitute<br>a security mechanism worthy of the name.<br>Also, allowing off-path attackers to induce requests to the mapping system<br>seems like a DoS vector only partially mitgiated by rate limiting.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>One could perhaps quibble as to whether (1) through (3) constitute<br>"control-plane", vs. "out-of-band" given that this documents the LISP<br>Control-Plane as specific UDP messages.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When an ETR receives a Map-Request message with the probe-bit set, it<br>&nbsp;  returns a Map-Reply with the probe-bit set.&nbsp; The source address of<br>&nbsp;  the Map-Reply is set according to the procedure described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a>].<br><br>Please provide a detailed section reference; 6830bis does not specifically<br>cover source address selection for probes.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] The greatest<br>&nbsp;  benefit of RLOC-Probing is that it can handle many failure scenarios<br>&nbsp;  allowing the ITR to determine when the path to a specific Locator is<br>&nbsp;  reachable or has become unreachable, thus providing a robust<br>&nbsp;  mechanism for switching to using another Locator from the cached<br>&nbsp;  Locator.<br><br>nit: "greatest benefit ... handle many failure scenarios" is a strange<br>wording to me.&nbsp; Presumably the failures are not failures of the probing,<br>but rather network failures of some form?<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; An immediate Negative Map-Reply (with action code of "Natively-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forward", 15-minute Time to Live (TTL)) from the Map-Resolver if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Map-Resolver can determine that the requested EID does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exist.

How is versioning supposed to work?<br><br>Further given there is no new version, I wonder if the changes as outlined in section 10 are all backward-compatible? Especially for the introduction of the Message-Notify-Ack message, I guess there is no problem if a server sends it, however, as the sender of the Message-Notify message might not know if the other end supports sending of the Message-Notify-Ack it can't rely on it. This should be further discussed in the doc! Or is there another strategy to achieve backward compatibility?<br><br>2) Size and MTU<br><br>As outlined in the TSV-ART review (Thanks Colin!) this document does not discuss fragmentation or Path MTU discovery. <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> recommends to either perform Path MTU discovery or limit the message to 576 bytes for IPv4 or 1280 bytes for IPv6 (minus any static header). As this seems to be an appropriate size for LISP messages, I would recommend this approach. Relying on IP fragmentation (as indicated in the reply to the TSV-ART review) is not recommended by <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> as this would lead to IP packet without a UDP header, in the case of LISP, which can cause problem and loss when NATs are involved. In any case the chosen approach needs to be further discussed in the doc.<br><br>3) Rate-limiting and congestion control<br><br>Sec 5.3: "Map-Requests MUST be rate-limited.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that a Map-<br>&nbsp;  Request for the same EID-Prefix be sent no more than once per second."<br>As already noted by the TSV-ART review (Thanks Colin!), <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> actually recommends to not send more the one packet per 3 seconds, and that is a restriction for all traffic not on a per-receiver base, or implement congestion control. This limit is meant to not only protect the receiver but also the network from overloading. Why do you use a smaller interval here? Also if (appropriate) rate limiting is used, this should either be a MUST or more explanation when it is okay to use a smaller rate limit should be provided.<br>However, after all, I don't think you those the right approach here for rate limiting. A Map-Request is always expected to be followed by some reply. For these kind of communication pattern, <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> recommends to limit the number of outstanding requests to 1 (see sec 3.1.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> recommending one packet per RTT), also for all traffic and not only per receiver. However, this would also require to implement some simple mechanism to detect a message as lost (see also further below in point 4).<br><br>Similarly I'm not sure about the intent of this requirement in section 5.5:<br>"Map-Replies SHOULD be sent for an EID-Prefix no more often than once<br>&nbsp;  per second to the same requesting router. "<br>My understanding is that Replies are only sent when a request is received. Why is this additional rate limit needed? Again if used it should be 3 seconds for all traffic to be inline with <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a>. Also again, why is that not a MUST? Further recommendation are needed here.<br><br>Further section 6.1 say "Both the SMR sender and the Map-Request responder MUST rate-limit<br>&nbsp;  these messages.&nbsp; Rate-limiting can be implemented as a global rate-<br>&nbsp;  limiter or one rate-limiter per SMR destination."<br>This seems to be the same rate limit as mention above, or not...? It would probably make sense to rate limit the SMR even further. Please clarify and provide more guidance, e.g. what should the value of a potential additional rate limit for SMR be?<br><br>Respectively the following sentence in section 6.1 is also unclear:<br>"The remote ITR MUST rate-limit the Map-Request until it gets a Map-Reply"<br>Why is the rate-limit as currently proposed depend on the fact if a Map-Reply is received? Is the ITR supposed to retransmit the Map-Request...? <br><br>And finally the Map-Register, Map-Notify and Map-Notify-Ack messages does not seem to have any rate-limits. Recommendations inline with <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> should be provided for the total traffic and not only for a few message types. Again, Map-Notify and Map-Notify-Ack messages should be send only once per RTT as there is a feedback mechanism.<br><br>For Map-Register sec 8.2 say: "Map-Register messages are sent periodically from an ETR to a Map-<br>&nbsp;  Server with a suggested interval between messages of one minute."<br>However, this a rather a low bound than an upper bound. A required (MUST) rate limit is still needed.<br><br>4) Loss detection and retransmission<br><br>As also mention by the TSV-ART review (Once more thanks to Colin!), this spec has an ACK mechanism for Map-Requests and now also for Map-Notify, however, it does not specify what to do if the ACK is not received (loss detection and retransmission scheduling). This makes the spec incomplete and needs to be further specified in the doc (and also has a relation to the point 3 above of course).</div></td>

Most important the doc requires the support of authentication mechanism but not the use of it. I would like to see more clear MUST requirements here. Further, today and at this stage of the protocol (moving from exp to PS) I find it not acceptable anymore to have certain security feature as optional and outsourced into a different work-in-process draft. However, I leave further discussion to the SEC ADs.<br><br>3) Given the following statement:<br>"Note that while this document assumes a LISP-ALT database mapping<br>&nbsp;  infrastructure to illustrate certain aspects of Map-Server and Map-<br>&nbsp;  Resolver operation..."<br>it seems that <a href="/doc/rfc6836/">RFC6836</a> should be a normative reference, as it might not be possible to understand all details explained in this doc with knowing ALT.<br><br>4) Further I would also think that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-mn/">I-D.ietf-lisp-mn</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-pubsub/">I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub</a> should be normative references as the meaning of the respective bits it not further specified in this doc. Or can these bits just be ignored if <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-mn/">I-D.ietf-lisp-mn</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-pubsub/">I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub</a> are not implemented? If so that should be stated.<br><br>Clarification questions:<br>1) Sec 5.3.:<br>"For the initial case, the destination IP<br>&nbsp;  address used for the Map-Request is the data packet's destination<br>&nbsp;  address (i.e., the destination EID) that had a mapping cache lookup<br>&nbsp;  failure."<br>Does that mean that the Map-Request needs to use the IPv4 or IPv6 depending on the IP version used by the initial message from the EID. Is that always the case or just for this initial message? I would assume that for all other cases this is actually independent...? Because otherwise there would be a constraint on what needs to be requested. I would like t see further clarification about this in the doc.<br><br>2) In section 5.3: "The ITR MAY include all locally<br>&nbsp;  configured Locators in this list or just provide one locator address<br>&nbsp;  from each address family it supports."<br>Would it make sense to include a SHOULD requirement to at least the address family that is used to send the Request is included (to increase chance to enable a communication/get a reply)...?<br><br>3) Sec 5.4: "If all Weights for a Locator-Set are equal,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the receiver of the Map-Reply will decide how to load-split the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; traffic. "<br>Shouldn't the receiver in this case split the traffic equally? Otherwise how would you signal that the traffic should be split equally? Maybe use all zero instead to let the receiver decide...?<br><br>4) sec 6.1: "When an ITR receives an SMR-based Map-Request for which it does not<br>&nbsp;  have a cached mapping for the EID in the SMR message, it may not send<br>&nbsp;  an SMR-invoked Map-Request."<br>I guess this should be normative and probably also a MUST NOT or at least SHOULD NOT.<br><br>5) Section 7 seems to imply that if it is detected that no route is available, the ITR should basically do nothing and just drop any incoming packets for that ETR. Would it make sense for incremental deployability, to just forward the packet to the IP address of the EID instead...? This way the source host would not benefit in mobility cases but still gets connectivity otherwise. Or is that anyway not the implication? If that is the case, that should be further clarified in the doc.<br><br>6) Section 8.2 says: "Note that the Map-Notify message<br>&nbsp;  is sent to UDP destination port 4342, not to the source port<br>&nbsp;  specified in the original Map-Register message."<br>Actually why is that?<br><br>Some minor editorial comments:<br><br>1) First sentence in intro: the pointer to ietf-lisp-introduction as currently introduced, makes this reference look very normative:<br>"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-introduction/">I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction</a>] and [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a>] specifies..."<br>I would recommend the following wording:<br>"The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a>] (see also [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-introduction/">I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction</a>]) specifies..."<br><br>2) Also in intro: Given that 6830bis is a normative reference "LISP RFC 6830bis" should be replaced with the new RFC number in the text. This should be noted to the RFC editor; probably this is more obvious if RFCXXX is used instead.<br><br>3) Sec 5.4: "...for another way the R-bit MAY be used."<br>This looks like a lower case may would be more appropriate.</div></td>

Why is<br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>&nbsp; This draft is targeting Standard Track publication. It is the proper type of RFC, since is the evolution of <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>, which is experimental and is one of items in the LISP WG charter. The RFC type is indicated in the page header.<br><br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>	The document provides the specifications for the control-plane of LISP&nbsp; (Locator/Id Separation Protocol).&nbsp; LISP defines two namespaces, End-point&nbsp; Identifiers (EIDs) that identify end-hosts and Routing Locators (RLOCs) that identify network attachment points. In this way, LISP effectively separates control from data, and allows routers to create overlay networks.&nbsp; LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.<br>&nbsp; Mappings are distributed using a mapping distribution service. This document defines the front-end of such service, leveraging on the LISP Map-Server and LISP-Map-Resolver elements.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>	The current LISP WG charter has as main task porting the main LISP specifications on Standard Track. The WG has decided to focus on two main documents, one with the specifications of the data-plane and the other with the specifications of the control-plane. This document concerns the control-plane. The WG has showed support to the document from its first submission as individual draft and adopted it right away. On the technical side there was agreement in the WG and little discussion took place, mainly related include some features/improvements not present in <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a> and adding text that originally was in the LISP data-plane document. On the organisation of the document, more specifically on what to put in the data-plane document and what to put in the control-plane document there has been quite some discussion. The current version is the trade-off the WG&nbsp; achieved and for which clear consensus has been reached. The version of the document that was approved during WG Last Call is -10. As a shepherd I required a few editorial changes to the document to fix some nits.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>	There are at least three independent implementations of the LISP control-plane.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br><br>&nbsp; Luigi Iannone <br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Deborah Brungard .<br><br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br><br>&nbsp; I reviewed carefully the document. The text is clear and	understandable. I have checked the mailinglist and meeting minutes and publication WG consensus has been reached appropriately. I checked the ID nits and decided to ask the authors to fix them before submitting this writeup. The output of the IDnits tool for the -12 version of the document is provided on point 11. There is still a warning about a weird spacing, but the authors did not manage to get rid of that warning. May be the RFC Editor can help later on.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	As the document shepherd I have no concerns.<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No broader review is required for this document.<br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>	I have no specific concerns or issues to point out.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; All authors have made conforming IPR disclosure.<br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>	No IPR disclosures have been filed concerning this specific document. However, there is an IPR disclosure filled by Huawei on <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>, hence, because this document is based on that one, the same IPR disclosure may relate to this document.<br><br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There has been clear strong consensus behind this document, showing that the WG as a whole understand and agree with it.<br><br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>	Nobody did show extreme discontent nor threatened an appeal.<br><br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

For clarification, there is a normative reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/">draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis</a> and one to draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6834bis, but these documents passed as well WG Last Call.

If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>	&nbsp; There are no downward normative references.<br><br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	This document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc6833/">RFC 6833</a>, as mentioned in the header, abstract and introduction.<br><br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA already allocated UDP port number 4342 for the LISP Data-Plane.
