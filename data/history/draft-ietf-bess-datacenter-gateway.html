Although reading on within §5 you talk about the “label stack”, so it does appear you’re MPLS specific — probably this should be said up front, in that case?

So your cryptic warning above leaves me wondering, what are the cases in which RTC impedes the function of the specification?<br><br>8. General<br><br>The autodiscovery mechanism is clear as far as it goes, but I think not all failure modes are addressed. In particular, if there’s partial connectivity within a domain, I think long-term black holing can ensue. Consider this case: GW1 and GW2 are gateways in domain A. GW3 is a gateway in domain B. GW1 and GW2 discover one another and advertise one another’s encapsulation information accordingly, when advertising a route to prefix X. However, there’s a problem within GW1 and GW2’s domain, such that GW1 can reach X, but GW2 can’t. Even though GW2 may know it can’t reach X, and indeed GW2 isn’t advertising X, GW1 is still advertising GW2 as a viable gateway to reach X, and GW3 may well route traffic for X via GW2. <br><br>Admittedly, having partial connectivity within a domain as I’ve described is a broken situation to begin with, but stuff happens, and your spec would make matters worse. It might be worth acknowledging this issue somewhere in the document?</div></td>

Perhaps:<br><br>% This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation<br>% attribute to allow datacenter gateway routers to advertise routes to the<br>% prefixes reachable in the site, including advertising them on behalf of<br>% other gateways at the same site.&nbsp; This allows for multiple paths across<br>% the Internet or backbone (terminating at the different gateways) to be<br>% used by segment routing to steer traffic for load-balancing and<br>% resiliency purposes.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The solution described in this document is agnostic as to whether the<br>&nbsp;  transit ASes do or do not have SR capabilities.&nbsp; the solution uses SR<br>&nbsp;  to stitch together path segments between GWs and through the ASBRs.<br>&nbsp;  Thus, there is a requirement that the GWs and ASBRs are SR-capable.<br>&nbsp;  The solution supports the SR path being extended into the ingress and<br>&nbsp;  egress sites if they are SR-capable.<br><br>There seem to be some nodes marked "ASBR" that are at the boundary<br>between the two transit ASes, in Figure 1.&nbsp; This text leaves me<br>uncertain whether they are expected to support SR (vs just the ASBRs<br>that are attachment points for the ingress/egress GWs).<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Each GW is configured with an identifier for the site.&nbsp; That<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; identifier MUST be the same across all GWs to the site (i.e., the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same identifier is used by all GWs to the same site), and MUST be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unique across all sites that are connected (i.e., across all GWs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to all sites that are interconnected).<br><br>The advice in <a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> is probably<br>relevant here.&nbsp; How should we pick these identifiers?&nbsp; Which properties<br>are necessary and which are not needed?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Each GW MUST construct an import filtering rule to import any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; route that carries a route target with the same site identifier<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that the GW itself uses.&nbsp; This means that only these GWs will<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; import those routes, and that all GWs to the same site will import<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each other's routes and will learn (auto-discover) the current set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of active GWs for the site.<br><br>This seems pretty fragile in the face of identifier collisions; I hope<br>there is some good text in the security considerations that covers the<br>risks here.<br>[ed. it seems we cover other aspects relating to identifier selection<br>but not this one]<br>Is there any filtering that can be done other than by site identifier,<br>e.g., to know that a certain peer would never be able to advertise<br>something that validly has the same site identifier?<br><br>&nbsp;  As described in Section 1, each GW will include a Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation attribute with the GW encapsulation information for<br>&nbsp;  each of the site's active GWs (including itself) in every route<br>&nbsp;  advertised externally to that site.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(I assume this is not intended to preclude the usual route<br>filtering/split-horizon type stuff.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the current set of active GWs<br>&nbsp;  changes (due to the addition of a new GW or the failure/removal of an<br>&nbsp;  existing GW) each externally advertised route will be re-advertised<br>&nbsp;  with a new Tunnel Encapsulation attribute which reflects current set<br>&nbsp;  of active GWs.<br><br>The "everybody advertises the union of what they've seen" behavior seems<br>like it will latch NLRI in place as being a GW, but here we're saying<br>that removal will be propagated as well as addition.&nbsp; What's the<br>mechanism for removing stale data (whether maliciously added or as part<br>of maintenance?&nbsp; If it's an explicit withdrawl, is that also propagated<br>by everybody?&nbsp; How long does it have to stay around for?&nbsp; (I recognize<br>that some of this is just stock BGP, but I am looking for more clarity<br>on how it interacts with the "advertise the union of what you saw"<br>behavior that is new to this document.&nbsp; The text in the next paragraph<br>mentions that there can be situations with broken internal routing where<br>things land in a broken state -- how long do they stay broken and how<br>can they be fixed?<br><br>&nbsp;  If a gateway becomes disconnected from the backbone network, or if<br>&nbsp;  the site operator decides to terminate the gateway's activity, it<br>&nbsp;  MUST withdraw the advertisements described above.&nbsp; This means that<br>&nbsp;  remote gateways at other sites will stop seeing advertisements from<br>&nbsp;  this gateway.&nbsp; Note that if the routing within a site is broken (for<br>&nbsp;  example, such that there is a route from one GW to another, but not<br>&nbsp;  in the reverse direction), then it is possible that incoming traffic<br>&nbsp;  will be routed to the wrong GW to reach the destination prefix - in<br>&nbsp;  this degraded network situation, traffic may be dropped.<br><br>This is probably worth reiterating in the security considerations<br>section.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that if a GW is (mis)configured with a different site identifier<br>&nbsp;  from the other GWs to the same site then it will not be auto-<br>&nbsp;  discovered by the other GWs (and will not auto-discover the other<br>&nbsp;  GWs).&nbsp; This would result in a GW for another site receiving only the<br>&nbsp;  Tunnel Encapsulation attribute included in the BGP best route; i.e.,<br>&nbsp;  the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute of the (mis)configured GW or that<br>&nbsp;  of the other GWs.<br><br>Are there noteworthy operational considerations of this, e.g., if all<br>the traffic gets directed to a GW that lacks the bandwidth to handle it?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  attribute to identify the GWs through which X can be reached.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp;  uses this information to compute SR Traffic Engineering (SR TE) paths<br>&nbsp;  across the backbone network looking at the information advertised to<br>&nbsp;  it in SR BGP Link State (BGP-LS)<br><br>This seems to leave the reader wondering about the details of how those<br>SR TE paths are computed.&nbsp; I understand that it's properly out of scope<br>for this document, but a reference would go a long way.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  for a prefix X, then each GW computes an SR TE path through that site<br>&nbsp;  to X from each of the currently active GWs, and places each in an<br>&nbsp;  MPLS label stack sub-TLV [<a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC9012</a>] in the SR Tunnel TLV for that GW.<br><br>I don't think I understand why each (egress) GW has to (re)compute the<br>path through the site to X for each of the GWs at the site -- can't it<br>just take the sub-TLV it got from the peer and re-propagate it?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>[The topic of which sites are allowed to send in the site's native<br>encapsulation seems related to questions of what an "SR Domain" is and<br>what boundary security it has.&nbsp; I think that the other ADs are basically<br>covering this topic, though, so am not sure there is much more to say<br>here.]<br><br>&nbsp;  If the GWs for a given site are configured to allow remote GWs to<br>&nbsp;  send them a packet in that site's native encapsulation, then each GW<br>&nbsp;  will also include multiple instances of a Tunnel TLV for that native<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation in externally advertised routes: one for each GW and<br>&nbsp;  each containing a Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV with that GW's<br>&nbsp;  address.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Does this implicitly require that all the GWs of the site have the same<br>configuration for whether or not to allow native encapsulation from<br>remote GWs?&nbsp; How would things degrade if a mixed configuration did<br>happen to occur?<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  From a protocol point of view, the mechanisms described in this<br>&nbsp;  document can leverage the security mechanisms already defined for<br>&nbsp;  BGP.&nbsp; Further discussion of security considerations for BGP may be<br>&nbsp;  found in the BGP specification itself [<a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC4271</a>] and in the security<br>&nbsp;  analysis for BGP [<a href="/doc/rfc4272/">RFC4272</a>].&nbsp; The original discussion of the use of<br>&nbsp;  the TCP MD5 signature option to protect BGP sessions is found in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5925/">RFC5925</a>], while [<a href="/doc/rfc6952/">RFC6952</a>] includes an analysis of BGP keying and<br>&nbsp;  authentication issues.<br><br>Such an elegant way of not mentioning TCP-AO :)<br>(I do see that it is actually referenced, just not mentioned by name.)<br><br>The whole section is quite nicely done, actually -- thank you!<br><br>Section 11<br><br>I don't really understand why <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe/">draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe</a><br>is listed as normative but <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext/">draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext</a> is<br>listed as informative.&nbsp; They seem to be used in the same place.<br><br>NITS/EDITORIAL<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  two DC sites.&nbsp; In order for a source DC (also known as an ingress DC)<br>&nbsp;  that uses SR to load balance the flows it sends to a destination DC<br><br>I'd consider "also known as an ingress DC since it forms the ingress<br>endpoint of a tunnel".<br><br>&nbsp;  sites could each be constructed differently and use different<br>&nbsp;  technologies such as IP, MPLS with global table routing native BGP to<br>&nbsp;  the edge, MPLS IP VPN, SR-MPLS IP VPN, or SRv6 IP VPN.&nbsp; That is, the<br><br>FWIW I don't think I figured out what "MPLS with global table routing<br>native BGP to the edge" means with any real confidence, and my attempts<br>to google it basically just found this document.&nbsp; So please feel<br>encouraged to take another look at the phrasing.&nbsp; My current most-likely<br>interpretation is that there is internally MPLS with global table, but<br>that what's presented to the outside is native BGP-based IP routing, so<br>there's some implied translation layer.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid the side effect of applying the Tunnel Encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  attribute to any packet that is addressed to the GW itself, the GW<br>&nbsp;  MUST use a different loopback address for packets intended for it.<br><br>"different" is most clear when we list both things that differ.<br>So perhaps it's safer to say that the address advertised for<br>auto-discovery must use a different loopback address than is advertised<br>for packets directed to the gateway itself.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  achieve this, each Tunnel TLV in the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute<br>&nbsp;  contains a Prefix SID sub-TLV [<a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC9012</a>] for X.&nbsp; As defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC9012</a>], the Prefix SID sub-TLV is only for IPv4/IPV6 labelled<br><br>I wonder if this sentence break should really be a paragraph break,<br>since the following paragraph seems to cover MPLS in a way that roughly<br>parallels how we treat IP here.<br><br>&nbsp;  applies to routes of those types.&nbsp; If the use of the Prefix SID sub-<br>&nbsp;  tlv for routes of other types is defined in the future, further<br>&nbsp;  documents will be needed to describe their use.<br><br>I think that we are missing a "for SR TE tunnel encapsulation" at the<br>end, as the current text is basically saying "if the use of X is defined<br>in the future, future documents will be needed to describe the use of<br>X", which is fairly devoid of content.<br><br>&nbsp;  Alternatively, if MPLS SR is in use and if the GWs for a given site<br>&nbsp;  are configured to allow remote GWs to perform SR TE through that site<br>&nbsp;  for a prefix X, then each GW computes an SR TE path through that site<br><br>We might benefit from sprinkling around some "ingress" and "egress"<br>here.</div></td>

There’s surprisingly little in this document that seems to be SR-specific (and what there is, has some problems, see below). Is there some reason you rule out interconnecting domains using other tunneling technologies? I ask this question first because if the answer were to be “oh huh, we don’t need to make this SR-specific after all” some of the other things I’m asking about might go away.<br><br>2. There’s no discussion about what trust model you’re assuming. SR brings with it its own assumed trust model, laid out in <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> as “SR operates within a trusted domain” (whatever *that* means). On the one hand, given you’re tying yourself to SR you presumably are tied to its trust model. On the other hand, there are some tantalizing tidbits that suggest otherwise. I would be happier if there were some explicit description of the trust model you’re presuming. It’s hard to evaluate some aspects of the document without knowing if you’re assuming the <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> closed domain model, or something else.<br><br>3. The use of the term “SR domain” in this document appears inconsistent with its definition in <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>. Here’s that definition, from §2:<br><br>&nbsp;  Segment Routing domain (SR domain): the set of nodes participating in<br>&nbsp;  the source-based routing model.&nbsp; These nodes may be connected to the<br>&nbsp;  same physical infrastructure (e.g., a Service Provider's network).<br>&nbsp;  They may as well be remotely connected to each other (e.g., an<br>&nbsp;  enterprise VPN or an overlay).&nbsp; If multiple protocol instances are<br>&nbsp;  deployed, the SR domain most commonly includes all of the protocol<br>&nbsp;  instances in a network.&nbsp; However, some deployments may wish to<br>&nbsp;  subdivide the network into multiple SR domains, each of which<br>&nbsp;  includes one or more protocol instances.&nbsp; It is expected that all<br>&nbsp;  nodes in an SR domain are managed by the same administrative entity.<br><br>And notably, later in 8402 §8 we are told that<br><br>&nbsp;  By default, SR operates within a trusted domain.&nbsp; Traffic MUST be<br>&nbsp;  filtered at the domain boundaries.<br><br>Which specifically means, to take the MPLS instantiation of SR (§8.1):<br><br>&nbsp;  SR domain boundary routers MUST filter any external traffic destined<br>&nbsp;  to a label associated with a segment within the trusted domain.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  includes labels within the SRGB of the trusted domain, labels within<br>&nbsp;  the SRLB of the specific boundary router, and labels outside either<br>&nbsp;  of these blocks.&nbsp; External traffic is any traffic received from an<br>&nbsp;  interface connected to a node outside the domain of trust.<br><br>More simply put, 8402 says you can’t send an SR packet from outside an SR domain, into that domain. But your document is written in terms of a multiplicity of SR domains, for example this in Section 1:<br><br>&nbsp;  Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.&nbsp; The gateway in the ingress SR domain<br>&nbsp;  can now see all possible paths to X in the egress SR domain<br><br>Maybe a quick fix, assuming you really do subscribe to the <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> trust model, is to invent, define, and use the term “SR subdomain” and deem all the subdomains to comprise one SR domain, in the sense of <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> §2 — “They may as well be remotely connected to each other (e.g., an enterprise VPN or an overlay)” seems to describe your situation pretty well.</div></td>

On the one hand, given you’re tying yourself to SR you presumably are tied to its trust model. On the other hand, there are some tantalizing tidbits that suggest otherwise. I would be happier if there were some explicit description of the trust model you’re presuming. It’s hard to evaluate some aspects of the document without knowing if you’re assuming the <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> closed domain model, or something else.<br><br>3. The use of the term “SR domain” in this document appears inconsistent with its definition in <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>. Here’s that definition, from §2:<br><br>&nbsp;  Segment Routing domain (SR domain): the set of nodes participating in<br>&nbsp;  the source-based routing model.&nbsp; These nodes may be connected to the<br>&nbsp;  same physical infrastructure (e.g., a Service Provider's network).<br>&nbsp;  They may as well be remotely connected to each other (e.g., an<br>&nbsp;  enterprise VPN or an overlay).&nbsp; If multiple protocol instances are<br>&nbsp;  deployed, the SR domain most commonly includes all of the protocol<br>&nbsp;  instances in a network.&nbsp; However, some deployments may wish to<br>&nbsp;  subdivide the network into multiple SR domains, each of which<br>&nbsp;  includes one or more protocol instances.&nbsp; It is expected that all<br>&nbsp;  nodes in an SR domain are managed by the same administrative entity.<br><br>And notably, later in 8402 §8 we are told that<br><br>&nbsp;  By default, SR operates within a trusted domain.&nbsp; Traffic MUST be<br>&nbsp;  filtered at the domain boundaries.<br><br>Which specifically means, to take the MPLS instantiation of SR (§8.1):<br><br>&nbsp;  SR domain boundary routers MUST filter any external traffic destined<br>&nbsp;  to a label associated with a segment within the trusted domain.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  includes labels within the SRGB of the trusted domain, labels within<br>&nbsp;  the SRLB of the specific boundary router, and labels outside either<br>&nbsp;  of these blocks.&nbsp; External traffic is any traffic received from an<br>&nbsp;  interface connected to a node outside the domain of trust.<br><br>More simply put, 8402 says you can’t send an SR packet from outside an SR domain, into that domain. But your document is written in terms of a multiplicity of SR domains, for example this in Section 1:<br><br>&nbsp;  Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.&nbsp; The gateway in the ingress SR domain<br>&nbsp;  can now see all possible paths to X in the egress SR domain<br><br>Maybe a quick fix, assuming you really do subscribe to the <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> trust model, is to invent, define, and use the term “SR subdomain” and deem all the subdomains to be one SR domain, in the sense of <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> §2 — “They may as well be remotely connected to each other (e.g., an enterprise VPN or an overlay)” seems to describe your situation pretty well.</div></td>

General<br><br>The autodiscovery mechanism is clear as far as it goes, but I think not all failure modes are addressed. In particular, if there’s partial connectivity within a domain, I think long-term black holing can ensue. Consider this case: GW1 and GW2 are gateways in domain A. GW3 is a gateway in domain B. GW1 and GW2 discover one another and advertise one another’s encapsulation information accordingly, when advertising a route to prefix X. However, there’s a problem within GW1 and GW2’s domain, such that GW1 can reach X, but GW2 can’t. Even though GW2 may know it can’t reach X, and indeed GW2 isn’t advertising X, GW1 is still advertising GW2 as a viable gateway to reach X, and GW3 may well route traffic for X via GW2. <br><br>Admittedly, having partial connectivity within a domain as I’ve described is a broken situation to begin with, but stuff happens, and your spec would make matters worse. It might be worth acknowledging this issue somewhere in the document?</div></td>
