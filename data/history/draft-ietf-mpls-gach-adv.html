This isn't a DISCUSS though<br>since I guess I could accept you saying "the receiver just puts<br>the TLV into a local database, but its seems fairly weak really.<br><br>- I assume that there are no congestion issues that are likely to<br>arise with the G-ACh due to the use of this protocol? <br><br>- section 2: What does the first sentence of the last para of<br>section 2 mean? I can't parse it anyway.<br><br>- section 3, p6: "An error MAY be logged" - does that mean<br>locally or create some new n/w traffic? If the latter, isn't that<br>a potential DoS vector? <br><br>- s3, p7: MI definition - how is MI expiry handled? You don't say<br>(here). If that uses the Lifetime from the application specific<br>body, then what if there are many of those?<br><br>- s3, p8: Why is an editor's note still present?<br><br>- s3, p8: Lifetime of 16 bits means max is ~18 hours. That seems<br>oddly short for configuration data for presumably heavily managed<br>links and liable to make implementation more complex since the<br>same stuff will have to be sent more than once every day. <br><br>- s3, p8: The "source-channel-application tuple" seems ambiguous<br>to me - I guess you mean expires-at is the higher level<br>Timestamp+Lifetime, right? Why not say that?<br><br>- 4.1: can a source IP address represent a multicast group or<br>does it have to be "unique" to the sender?<br><br>- 4.2: this seems like a nice potential DoS vector too. (Say if<br>caculation of some TLV for which I ask consumes resources for the<br>sender of a GAP message containing that TLV.)<br><br>- 4.2: So length=0 means "send all" but app-id=0x0000 means<br>"who's there"? That seems clunky to me fwiw. I also don't get how<br>the last para of 4.2 is fully specified. <br><br>- 5.1, Saying the MI is set at the "sender's discretion" seems<br>wrong, given you earlier said it has to be unique within some<br>(not that well) defined scope.<br><br>- 6.1: "secret string" - please don't say that as it&nbsp; might be<br>interpreted to mean something human readable/memorable which<br>results in far weaker security. Please say "secret value" or<br>"secret octet string" and for bonus points say that if this is<br>human memorable then its basically pointless and that<br>implementations MUST be able to handle essentially random binary<br>values of the appropriate length.<br><br>- 6.3: Please refer to <a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC2104</a> which is where HMAC is defined.<br>Following the bad practices from other RFCs that repeat the<br>definition is really not a good plan.<br><br>- I'd encourage you to say that use of GAP authentication is<br>RECOMMENDED?&nbsp; That way, it may get used. Otherwise, I suspect<br>that it may be ignored, and we may be sorry about that later if<br>it turns out to just be another fig-leaf.</div></td>

This isn't a DISCUSS though<br>since I guess I could accept you saying "the receiver just puts<br>the TLV into a local database, but its seems fairly weak really.<br><br>- I assume that there are no congestion issues that are likely to<br>arise with the G-ACh due to the use of this protocol? <br><br>- section 2: What does the first sentence of the last para of<br>section 2 mean? I can't parse it anyway.<br><br>- section 3, p6: "An error MAY be logged" - does that mean<br>locally or create some new n/w traffic? If the latter, isn't that<br>a potential DoS vector? <br><br>- s3, p7: MI definition - how is MI expiry handled? You don't say<br>(here). If that uses the Lifetime from the application specific<br>body, then what if there are many of those?<br><br>- s3, p8: Why is an editor's note still present?<br><br>- s3, p8: Lifetime of 16 bits means max is ~18 hours. That seems<br>oddly short for configuration data for presumably heavily managed<br>links and liable to make implementation more complex since the<br>same stuff will have to be sent more than once every day. <br><br>- s3, p8: The "source-channel-application tuple" seems ambiguous<br>to me - I guess you mean expires-at is the higher level<br>Timestamp+Lifetime, right? Why not say that?<br><br>- 4.1: can a source IP address represent a multicast group or<br>does it have to be "unique" to the sender?<br><br>- 4.2: this seems like a nice potential DoS vector too. (Say if<br>caculation of some TLV for which I ask consumes resources for the<br>sender of a GAP message containing that TLV.)<br><br>- 4.2: So length=0 means "send all" but app-id=0x0000 means<br>"who's there"? That seems clunky to me fwiw. I also don't get how<br>the last para of 4.2 is fully specified. <br><br>- 5.1, Saying the MI is set at the "sender's discretion" seems<br>wrong, given you earlier said it has to be unique within some<br>(not that well) defined scope.<br><br>- 6.1: "secret string" - please don't say that as it&nbsp; might be<br>interpreted to mean something human readable/memorable which<br>results in far weaker security. Please say "secret value" or<br>"secret octet string" and for bonus points say that if this is<br>human memorable then its basically pointless and that<br>implementations MUST be able to handle essentially random binary<br>values of the appropriate length.<br><br>- 6.3: Please refer to <a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC2104</a> which is where HMAC is defined.<br>Following the bad practices from other RFCs that repeat the<br>definition is really not a good plan.<br><br>- I'd encourage you to say that use of GAP authentication is<br>RECOMMENDED?&nbsp; That way, it may get used. Otherwise, I suspect<br>that it may be ignored, and we may be sorry about that later if<br>it turns out to just be another fig-leaf.</div></td>

Especially, if multiple applications send their GAP messages at the same time, for whatever reason. <br><br>Section 5.1., paragraph 8:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; In some cases an application may desire additional reliability for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; the delivery of some of its data.&nbsp; When this is the case, the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; transmitter MAY send several (for example three) instances of the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; message in succession, separated by a delay appropriate to, or<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; specified by, the application.&nbsp; For example this procedure might be<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; invoked when sending a flush instruction following device reset.&nbsp; The<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; expectation is that the receiver will detect duplicate messages using<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; the MI.<br><br> This looks like a potential issue in terms of multiple applications intend to send burst of data.<br>&nbsp; I can see the goal to have some sort of reliability in GAP message delivery, but sending a burst of data (i.e., three in a row is a burst) will cause trouble at some point. <br><br> In general, it might look easy to avoid any congestion control in this setting, but I can see that this lack of congestion control is putting the GACH at risk due to an overload situation. <br><br>2) Timing issue:<br>Section 3., paragraph 13:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Message Identifier (MI): Unique identifier of this message.&nbsp; A<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sender MUST NOT re-use an MI over a given channel until the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  message lifetime has expired.&nbsp; The sole purpose of this field is<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  duplicate detection in the event of a message burst (Section 5.1).<br><br>Does this mean that the sender can immediately reuse the MI after the timer has expired at the sender's side? If yes, there is the chance for a race condition, as the receiver side might not yet have expired the timer. I would propose to add some safety margin, i.e., so it the MI is expired on both sides.</div></td>

It was a nice surprise and is nearly<br>but not quite there:-) I hope these discuss points will be easily<br>resolved.<br><br>(1) 6.1: Why is there no mandatory to implement HMAC hash<br>function? Without that, you won't get interop. I suggest making<br>HMAC-SHA256 MTI. HMAC-SHA1 would also be ok. (I'd also suggest<br>just deleting the other options unless you've a specific reason<br>to want them here.)<br><br>(2) 9: How do you know that application specific data won't<br>require confidentiality? I can imagine keys being sent using<br>this, as has been done in Diameter. If you don't want to define a<br>confidentiality service then I suggest that you say that<br>application or GAP TLVs that require confidentiality (such as<br>cryptographic keys) MUST NOT be sent in clear using the GAP<br>protocol because someone will write a draft that does just that<br>otherwise. <br><br>(3) 6.1: If using karp key tables, how do the SendNotBefore,<br>SendNotAfter and similar values from that map to the<br>Timestamp+Lifetime used here? I think you need to say as<br>implementers will make different assumptions otherwise. (I don't<br>care much which of the reasonable options you choose.)<br><br>(4) 6.2: you need to say what is in the V for the auth data TLV<br>as input to HMAC. Options are to include L zeros as the value or<br>for the V octets to be missing on input to HMAC. See also the<br>secdir review [1] which makes the same point.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  [1] <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg03795.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/msg03795.html</a></div></td>

I can't parse it anyway.<br><br>- section 3, p6: "An error MAY be logged" - does that mean<br>locally or create some new n/w traffic? If the latter, isn't that<br>a potential DoS vector? <br><br>- s3, p7: MI definition - how is MI expiry handled? You don't say<br>(here).

That seems<br>oddly short for configuration data for presumably heavily managed<br>links and liable to make implementation more complex since the<br>same stuff will have to be sent more than once every day. <br><br>- s3, p8: The "source-channel-application tuple" seems ambiguous<br>to me - I guess you mean expires-at is the higher level<br>Timestamp+Lifetime, right? Why not say that?<br><br>- 4.1: can a source IP address represent a multicast group or<br>does it have to be "unique" to the sender?<br><br>- 4.2: this seems like a nice potential DoS vector too. (Say if<br>caculation of some TLV for which I ask consumes resources for the<br>sender of a GAP message containing that TLV.)<br><br>- 4.2: So length=0 means "send all" but app-id=0x0000 means<br>"who's there"? That seems clunky to me fwiw. I also don't get how<br>the last para of 4.2 is fully specified. <br><br>- 5.1, Saying the MI is set at the "sender's discretion" seems<br>wrong, given you earlier said it has to be unique within some<br>(not that well) defined scope.<br><br>- 6.1: "secret string" - please don't say that as it&nbsp; might be<br>interpreted to mean something human readable/memorable which<br>results in far weaker security. Please say "secret value" or<br>"secret octet string" and for bonus points say that if this is<br>human memorable then its basically pointless and that<br>implementations MUST be able to handle essentially random binary<br>values of the appropriate length.<br><br>- 6.3: Please refer to <a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC2104</a> which is where HMAC is defined.<br>Following the bad practices from other RFCs that repeat the<br>definition is really not a good plan.<br><br>- I'd encourage you to say that use of GAP authentication is<br>RECOMMENDED?&nbsp; That way, it may get used.

It seems to say: "If the <br>sender doesn't fancy setting it, that's OK."<br><br>Additionally, it is not clear what the uniqueness scope of the Message<br>Identifier is supposed to be. Presumably not globally unique! Is it per<br>sender or per data-channel per sender?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>The sole purpose of the MI seems to be contained in the final paragraph <br>of Section 5.1. If that is the case, you seem to have some confusion <br>between rapid retransmission (same message) and lifetime avoiding<br>retransmission (different message). All this needs to be cleaned up and<br>explained. Noting that the last sentence of 5.1 belongs in 5.2.<br><br>I have to wonder whether you really need the field.<br><br>---<br><br>Sections 2, 3, and 5<br><br>&nbsp;  The Lifetime field specifies how long,<br>&nbsp;  in seconds, the receiver should retain the data in this message.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  the lifetime is zero the data is immediately marked as expired.<br><br>Have you considered offering a lifetime value meaning "retain until&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>replaced"? This would *considerably* simplify the job of the sender <br>which would not need to run multiple timers to ensure that the <br>information is updated in a timely manner and doesn't accidentally<br>expire.<br><br>Note also that 2*16 seconds is not a very long time. things like the<br>MAC address of an interface can safely be considered "stable".<br><br>In rather a topsy-turvy way you say in Section 5.1...<br>&nbsp;  Lifetimes SHOULD be set in such a way that at least three updates<br>&nbsp;  will be sent prior to Lifetime expiration.&nbsp; For example, if updates<br>&nbsp;  are sent at least every 60 seconds, a Lifetime of 185 seconds may be<br>&nbsp;  used.<br>...Isn't it the other way around? Shouldn't updates be sent according to<br>the lifetime value that has been set?<br><br>Discarding the information when the timer expires needs to be clarified.<br>I think you mean "revert to the configuration-based state that was held <br>before the information was received." But you might mean "transition to<br>the complete absence of this information."<br><br>In Section 2 should you discuss message loss and the consequences? Any<br>mitigation you need to add? Is the retransmission to protect against <br>lifetime expiry supposed to handle this? If so, it doesn't seem<br>frequent enough to install the initial state? Do you need a two-speed<br>timer: rapid on first use and dropping down to slow for state retention?<br>Or would an Ack be easier? Probably, the final paragraph of Section 5.1<br>can be adapted to handle this case, and then you can put a forward <br>pointer in Section 2.<br><br>But note that the final paragraph of 5.1 is a bit of a mess!...<br>&nbsp;  In some cases additional reliability may be desired for the delivery<br>&nbsp;  of a GAP message.&nbsp; When this is the case, the RECOMMENDED procedure<br>&nbsp;  is to send three instances of the message in succession, separated by<br>&nbsp;  a delay appropriate to the application.&nbsp; This procedure SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  used, if at all, only for messages that are in some sense<br>&nbsp;  exceptional; for example when sending a flush instruction following<br>&nbsp;  device reset.&nbsp; The MI may be used to detect and discard duplicate<br>&nbsp;  messages.<br>...What is a "delay appropriate to the application?" Maybe it means <br>"Each specification of a GAP application must state the appropriate<br>delay to use for such fast retransmission." Which would be fine, but<br>would require this document to make the statement for Application 0x0000<br>and would require [] to make a statement for Application 0x0001.<br>... Also "The procedure SHOULD be used..." reads like the procedure is<br>intended to be used. But "...if at all" really means "The procedure <br>SHOULD NOT be used except..."<br><br>I can't understand what is meant by "If the lifetime is zero the data is<br>immediately marked as expired." Are you trying to say that the data <br>should be processed, potentially replacing any stored information, and<br>then should be "discarded" (noting my previous comment about "discarded"<br>not being clear)? Or are you trying to say, that the ADB element should<br>be discarded unprocessed?<br><br>Lastly, the recommended multiplier ("at least three updates will be sent<br>prior to Lifetime expiration") cuts it too fine! You need to allow for<br>out-queues, transmission, and processing. The normal approach to this <br>(probably going back to Van Jacobson) is to add a unit of half. Thus,<br>in your case, Lifetime = 3.5 * Update.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Are TLV Value fields padded up to a multiple of 4 octets?<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3<br><br>It is clear that each ADB element must contain at least one TLV. What <br>is the error processing for an empty ADB element?<br><br>---<br><br>Section 4<br><br>Since the Application ID 0x0000 ADB contains "metadata and processing<br>instructions rather than static data that is meant to be retained" <br>please explain how the Lifetime field is to be set/interpreted.<br><br>---<br><br>Does the TLV in Section 4.1 support the identifiers described in <br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers/">I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-itu-t-identifiers</a>]?

It is not clear to me where the definitive reference for<br>those types live. I would like to see more clarity in the text about<br>which address (and where it is specified) is intended for each new<br>code point that you are asking IANA to allocate.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2 says that this is a one-way protocol, however, Section 4.2<br>defines an Application ID 0x0000 TLV that forms part of a two-way<br>exchange and is actually a direct request for information. <br><br>Additionally, it seems a little odd to hide this in a TLV when what it<br>really is is a separate message type. By placing it in the TLVs you <br>open up the prospect of message thrash as two implementations send<br>each other updates without clearing out this TLV.<br><br>The problem might be amusingly exacerbated by placing 0x0000 in the<br>list of Application ID for which a refresh is requested.<br><br>In any case, please explicitly clarify that setting a length of zero <br>intends retransmission of the 0x0000 Application data.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>Does the flush apply to the 0x0000 Application Data previously sent?<br><br>Why do you not allow selective flushing per Application?<br><br>---<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The request is strictly advisory: the<br>&nbsp;  receiver SHOULD accept and act on the request, but MAY override it at<br>&nbsp;  any time.<br><br>The "SHOULD" that you have used is stronger than "advisory". What is <br>more you don't mean "advisory" you mean "a request".<br><br>I suggest you change this to<br><br>&nbsp;  ...the receiver MAY accept and act on the request, MAY ignore the <br>&nbsp;  request, or MAY resume transmissions at any time according to <br>&nbsp;  implementation or configuration choices, and depending on local<br>&nbsp;  pragmatics.<br><br>This section is another example of a TLV that violates the statement<br>in Section 2 that this is a one-way protocol.<br><br>Lastly, you need to say what it means if the Duration leaves the <br>information as expired (i.e. the Duration takes us beyond the end of<br>the Lifetime). Obviously the sender (of the original information) can<br>decide that that would be a bad thing and retransmit anyway, but it is<br>not clear what the receiver (of the information) would do if the<br>transmission is not made.<br><br>Frankly, however, it is not clear why you have this TLV. Having gone<br>through the hoops of deciding that you need to be able to send the <br>data, that the data can time out, and that you need to retransmit the<br>data, I think you need to give better motivation for this TLV.<br><br>---<br><br>I wish Sections 4.1 through 4.5 would end up containing the actual <br>TLV Type codes to be used for each TLV. This could be achieved by<br>simply including the values in the figures. (This is safe because <br>these are the first allocations from the new registry and there is<br>no question of IANA not allocating them as requested).<br><br>---<br><br>5.1 I like that operation of GAP SHOULD be configurable per data<br>channel. But you appear to have written "SHALL".&nbsp; This precludes <br>making an implementation that automatically and always runs GAP. <br>(I think it still allows implementations that don't support GAP at<br>all because they don't implement this spec).<br><br>---<br><br>Paragraph 3 of section 5.2 talks about retaining objects for <br>application data that can be handled. But this is implementation-<br>specific. I think it is only the information that has to be retained.<br>Try to talk about function rather than constrain implementation.<br><br>---<br><br>The last paragraph of 5.2 is a bit confusing.<br><br>&nbsp;  The receiver MAY make use of the application data contained in a GAP<br>&nbsp;  message to perform some level of autoconfiguration, for example if<br>&nbsp;  the application is an OAM protocol.&nbsp; The implementation SHOULD,<br>&nbsp;  however, take care to prevent cases of oscillation resulting from<br>&nbsp;  each endpoint attempting to adjust its configuration to match the<br>&nbsp;  other.&nbsp; Any such autoconfiguration based on GAP information MUST be<br>&nbsp;  disabled by default.<br><br>I *think* you are really trying to place constraints on future<br>specifications rather than on implementations (there is nothing in this<br>specification that could be used for auto-conf). But I note that<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing/">I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing</a>] looks like auto-conf and is not<br>disabled by default.<br><br>---<br><br>In Section 6.1, you should discuss the operation of key exchange <br>protocols in the absence of IP protocols in the network. After all, one<br>of the use-cases (oh, the only use case :-) for GAP is to operate in<br>networks that don't have IP available. You might also note that GAP is<br>described as a protocol for exchanging capabilities and configuration:<br>keys might be described by some as exactly such information.<br><br>If your fall-back is that keys have to be manually configured in the<br>absence of IP, then you desperately need to call this out in <br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing/">I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing</a>] because manual configuration of<br>keys seems a whole lot harder than manual configuration of MAC<br>addresses.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>I believe that <a href="/doc/rfc4107/">RFC 4107</a> says that you need to discuss mechanisms for<br>dynamic key update, to make a recommendation as to whether such <br>mechanisms are needed, and to state how often keys need to be updated.<br><br>---<br><br>The problem I see with processing of the Timestamp described in 6.2 is<br>that it does not allow for a sender correcting its clock. Can you add<br>text to help clarify how this case is handled.<br><br>---<br><br>The final paragraph of Section 6.2 is a bit of a throw-away. What you<br>are saying, I think is that "Full algorithm flexibility is provided by<br>the protocol's use of the Authentication Key Identifier which acts as <br>an indirect reference to the algorithm and key data in use.
