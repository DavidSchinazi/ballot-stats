The Security Considerations section hint around the risk of breaking the intended isolation of tenants without ever stating that possibility in the first few sections that describe securing NVEs, NVAs, and management systems.&nbsp; The risks should be explained so that the reader, including developers and implementers, understand that breaking the designed tenant isolation is possible when security requirements and considerations are not met (or there are weaknesses/flaws in software).&nbsp; This may help to further motivate implementation of security requirements.<br><br>2. The framework describes both overlay and underlay networks.&nbsp; When responding to Alissa's discuss, I would like like to see the text address when encryption is needed with the associated risks for the overlay and underlay networks as well, the answers may be different for each.&nbsp; The security considerations section goes back and forth between the two right now without always calling out which it is referring to and this would be helpful.&nbsp; This is also the case for the unauthorized access descriptions in the security considerations section.&nbsp; I'm adding this as a second discuss to make sure we can work through some text to add and these considerations are included as I think they will be helpful to address what each means for both overlay and underlay networks (management/control data and tenant data).<br><br>Not yet addressed:<br>For Alissa's comment, it would be good to include the reference intended in the draft for opportunistic encryption to avoid confusion.</div></td>

Operational Management Considerations, but I share Al Morton's views (OPS-DIR review) on this section<br><br>...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As far as the IP underlay is concerned, existing IP OAM facilities <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are used.&nbsp; <br>So, a clear mapping between overlay and underlay addresses is needed<br>by the person or entity directing OAM activities, right? It appears<br>section 3.1.5.3 discusses this to some degree. Section 3.3 on VM<br>Mobility adds to the complexity of performing meaningful OAM. <br>Maybe I expect too much from this document and this is/will be covered in <a href="/doc/draft-ashwood-nvo3-oam-requirements/">draft-ashwood-nvo3-oam-requirements</a>?<br><br>. . .<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As far as configuration is concerned, the DC environment is driven <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by the need to bring new services up rapidly and is typically very <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  dynamic specifically in the context of virtualized services. It is <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  therefore critical to automate the configuration of NVO3 services. <br>This last sentence sounds like a requirement, but automation does not<br>appear to be addressed very extensively in the draft, <br>except that VNI values are automatically generated by the egress NVE,<br>and there are a few others.<br><br>-<br> 4.1. Pros &amp; Cons <br>The Cons and other issues raised in section 4 are potential<br>pitfalls for operations, and this could be noted.<br><br>In particular, sections 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 point to difficulties <br>of VM placement and the lack of interaction between network layers<br>when coordination is needed in critical areas.<br>For example, with many specific examples provided in the previous<br>sections, how do the authors recommend to provision bandwidth in<br>the IP network for each, ideally performance-isolated, VNI?<br><br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>EDITORIAL: -<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ... to provide similar functions to a ToR.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ...<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Another example is the case where the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  End Device is the Tenant System, and the NVE function can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  implemented by the connected ToR<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ...<br><br>ToR =&gt; ToR switch<br>There are multiple instances of this.<br><br>- Having figure 3 and section 3 would help readability.<br><br>- Some more comments, more editorial, from Al Morton<br><br>Although I don't request a change in terminology, I found the term<br>"underlay" to be distracting as a non-indoctrinated reader. Further,<br>Figure 3 doesn't identify the underlay network, but it depicts the<br>L3 Network (IP underlay) above the "Overlay" network and therefore<br>the figure is drawn upside-down.

The Security Considerations section hint around the risk of breaking the intended isolation of tenants without ever stating that possibility in the first few sections that describe securing NVEs, NVAs, and management systems.&nbsp; The risks should be explained so that the reader, including developers and implementers, understand that breaking the designed tenant isolation is possible when security requirements and considerations are not met (or there are weaknesses/flaws in software).&nbsp; This may help to further motivate implementation of security requirements.<br><br>2. The framework describes both overlay and underlay networks.&nbsp; When responding to Alissa's discuss, I would like like to see the text address when encryption is needed with the associated risks for the overlay and underlay networks as well, the answers may be different for each.&nbsp; The security considerations section goes back and forth between the two right now without always calling out which it is referring to and this would be helpful.&nbsp; This is also the case for the unauthorized access descriptions in the security considerations section.&nbsp; I'm adding this as a second discuss to make sure we can work through some text to add and these considerations are included as I think they will be helpful to address what each means for both overlay and underlay networks (management/control data and tenant data).</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents.

There has been nothing unusual or particularly controversial about the<br>&nbsp;  working group process for the draft.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR declarations on the draft.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document. I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed on the list since <br>&nbsp;  formation of the NVO3 working group.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need<br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com">matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Alia Atlas (<a href="mailto:akatlas%2Biesg@gmail.com">akatlas+iesg@gmail.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v04 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that have been resolved in the<br> latest&nbsp; version (v05). <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br> <br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review. The document has <br>&nbsp; been developed within the WG and reviewed over a <br>&nbsp; period of a number of IETFs, as well as being a major focus of the BoF<br>&nbsp; that led to the creation of the NVO3 working group. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It has been <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussed over a long period , both in face to face IETF meetings<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and on the list. It received a number of comments in WG last call that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; were addressed by the authors. Some comments were related to the detailed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; architecture and would be more appropriate to address in an architecture<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; draft that is currently being developed by the NVO3 Working group. <br><br>There were a number of comments on the draft during IETF last call. These<br>included&nbsp; an objection to examples of particular loop removal techniques, that<br>might infer specific solutions or interpreted to rule out other solutions.&nbsp; These<br>were removed from the draft and I believe this new text reflects the consensus of<br>the discussion. There was also a comment related to the inclusion of an inter-virtual<br>network gateway function in the NVO3 reference model. There was some debate as<br>to whether this is a special type of Network Virtualization Edge (NVE). Note that<br>a similar discussion has occurred within the NVO3 working group in October 2013,<br>and this resulted in text describing gateways added to the<br>draft-ietf-nvo3-arch-01. The consensus was that the separate NVO3 architecture draft would be a better place for detailing such functional components. The framework draft was therefore not updated to include and further details of an inter-VN gateway function. I am comfortable that this outcome is in line with previous consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

It does not <br>&nbsp;  specify new protocols, but rather provides the overall framework, including<br>&nbsp;  functional reference models, in which existing or new protocols would operate in a <br>&nbsp;  multi-tenant data center, together with defining some required terminology.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The intended status is properly indicated.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; This document provides a framework for Network Virtualization over<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  L3 (NVO3) and it defines a reference model along with logical<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  components required to design a solution.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is one of the base documents chartered for the NVO3 working group.<br>&nbsp;  The first version of the draft was introduced at the time of the WG forming BoF for<br>&nbsp;  NVO3, as a way to provide network architecture context to the design of a multi-tenant<br>&nbsp;  data centre, for example in defining the terminology and functional blocks that are<br>&nbsp;  required. There has been nothing unusual or particularly controversial about the<br>&nbsp;  working group process for the draft.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR declarations on the draft.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document. I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed on the list since <br>&nbsp;  formation of the NVO3 working group.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need<br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com">matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Alia Atlas (<a href="mailto:akatlas%2Biesg@gmail.com">akatlas+iesg@gmail.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v04 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that have been resolved in the<br> latest&nbsp; version (v05). <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br> <br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review. The document has <br>&nbsp; been developed within the WG and reviewed over a <br>&nbsp; period of a number of IETFs, as well as being a major focus of the BoF<br>&nbsp; that led to the creation of the NVO3 working group. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author listed in the Authors Addresses section has personally indicated that<br>&nbsp;  they are not aware of any IPR that has not already been declared in accordance<br>&nbsp;  with <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and 79.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; None<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It has been <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussed over a long period , both in face to face IETF meetings<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and on the list. It received a number of comments in WG last call that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; were addressed by the authors. Some comments were related to the detailed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; architecture and would be more appropriate to address in an architecture<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; draft that is currently being developed by the NVO3 Working group. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ID-Nits passes. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no relevant formal review criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. All references are explicitly identified as informative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br> There are no normative references.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br> No. All references are informative.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified.

Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br> There are no sections containing formal language that needs reviewing.<br></div></td>

OpenFlow [OF] is one example of such<br>&nbsp;  a protocol."<br><br>Can you please explain how OpenFlow is being used to do this?&nbsp; From looking at the referenced spec, I do not see it.&nbsp; Certainly, OpenFlow can be used for a switch to send packets with unrecognized addresses up to the controller to be processed.&nbsp; This seems like quite a reach to claim that is what OpenFlow is doing.&nbsp; I do not see the rationale for mentioning this particular protocol here.<br><br><br>2)&nbsp; In Sec 2.2: NVE hub and NVE spoke appear for the first and only time.&nbsp; <br>"For instance, an End Device can act as an NVE Spoke, while an access switch can act as an NVE hub."<br><br>Can you please expand on what is meant in the draft?&nbsp; What functionality would be in an NVE spoke and what in an NVE hub?<br><br>3) In Sec 3.1.3, one option is "One VN Context identifier per Tenant".&nbsp; How does this satisfy the problem statement that says "Hence, there is a one-to-many mapping between tenants and virtual network instances." <br><br>Additionally, in Sec 3.1.3, the concept of globally unique vs. local seems to be mixed up with the ideas of per-tenant, per-VNI, and per-VAP.&nbsp;  I'd like to see some text that clarifies why this coupling exists?&nbsp; Presumably, it isn't impossible to satisfy the problem-statement's need for one-to-many using globally unique values??&nbsp; If it is, I'd certainly want to see that clearly articulated with reasons.<br><br>4) In Sec. 3.1.4, have you considered the possibility and advantages of opportunistic encryption to support a stateless tunneling approach?&nbsp; Are any tunneling mechanisms with confidentiality considered beyond IPSec?&nbsp;  Instead of ruling out stateful tunneling approaches, can you decouple the management considerations (say your centralized controller can specify the configuration in a rapid fashion) from the scaling considerations from other pros/cons for stateless versus stateful?&nbsp;  I'm particularly concerned because the only tunneling mechanism with confidentiality that is mentioned is IPsec which is stateful.&nbsp; In looking at the Security considerations in the problem-statement, it says "In addition to isolation, assurances against spoofing, snooping, transit modification and denial of service are examples of other important data plane considerations.&nbsp; Some limited environments may even require confidentiality." </div></td>

It does not <br>&nbsp;  specify new protocols, but rather provides the overall framework, including<br>&nbsp;  functional reference models, in which existing or new protocols would operate in a <br>&nbsp;  multi-tenant data center, together with defining some required terminology.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The intended status is properly indicated.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; This document provides a framework for Network Virtualization over<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  L3 (NVO3) and it defines a reference model along with logical<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  components required to design a solution.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is one of the base documents chartered for the NVO3 working group.<br>&nbsp;  The first version of the draft was introduced at the time of the WG forming BoF for<br>&nbsp;  NVO3, as a way to provide network architecture context to the design of a multi-tenant<br>&nbsp;  data centre, for example in defining the terminology and functional blocks that are<br>&nbsp;  required. There has been nothing unusual or particularly controversial about the<br>&nbsp;  working group process for the draft.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR declarations on the draft.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document. I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed on the list since <br>&nbsp;  formation of the NVO3 working group.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need<br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com">matthew.bocci@alcatel-lucent.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Stewart Bryant (<a href="mailto:stbryant@cisco.com">stbryant@cisco.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v04 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that have been resolved in the<br> latest&nbsp; version (v05). <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br> <br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review. The document has <br>&nbsp; been developed within the WG and reviewed over a <br>&nbsp; period of a number of IETFs, as well as being a major focus of the BoF<br>&nbsp; that led to the creation of the NVO3 working group. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author listed in the Authors Addresses section has personally indicated that<br>&nbsp;  they are not aware of any IPR that has not already been declared in accordance<br>&nbsp;  with <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and 79.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; None<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It has been <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussed over a long period , both in face to face IETF meetings<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and on the list. It received a number of comments in WG last call that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; were addressed by the authors. Some comments were related to the detailed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; architecture and would be more appropriate to address in an architecture<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; draft that is currently being developed by the NVO3 Working group. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ID-Nits passes. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no relevant formal review criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. All references are explicitly identified as informative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br> There are no normative references.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br> No. All references are informative.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA actions.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br> There are no sections containing formal language that needs reviewing.<br></div></td>
