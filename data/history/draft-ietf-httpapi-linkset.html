It’s a little regrettable from that point of view that the section will be removed; in slightly different form it might make a nice addition to the “use cases” section, making the abstract use cases more concrete. (I’m not strongly advocating that you make this change, just mentioning the thought.)<br><br>## Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification uses the terms "link context" and "link target" as<br>&nbsp;  defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>].<br><br>Since I’m not a subject area expert, I went to <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> to find these definitions. There are none worthy of the name, and this made me sad.&nbsp; It seems that “link context” must be a term of art so familiar to those in the know that they don’t even perceive that it needs definition. This isn’t a flaw in the present document, but in <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a>; still, I’d prefer that the present document not make the claim that <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> provides a definition, when it doesn’t. The statement in §4 that 8288 has an abstract model for a link, seems more accurate.<br><br>You could rewrite as “This specification uses the terms “link context” and “link target” in the same manner <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> does” and that would work for me. <br><br>## Section 4:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The format defined in Section 4.1 is near identical to the field<br><br>Should be “near-identical” or (preferably) “nearly identical”. (Same comment applies to the first sentence of §4.1.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value of the HTTP "Link" header field as specified in Web Linking<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>].<br><br>While <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> is indeed titled “Web Linking” this expansion of the title, juxtaposed with the section number, makes the sentence scan in a misleading way. I suggest just removing the title of the RFC (so: “… as specified in Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>]”) or alternately, qualifying the title and adding parentheses (so: “… as specified in the Web Linking RFC (Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>])”). My own preference is for the first option.<br><br>&nbsp;  As a result, implementers of link sets should strive to make them<br>&nbsp;  self-contained by following the recommendations provided below.<br><br>This is pretty nitty, but I suggest “… strive to make them self-contained by adhering to the following recommendations.” The point of the rewrite being that “below” indicates the recommendations could be anywhere in the remainder of the spec, whereas following means “I’m about to tell you what they are”. The change to “adhering” is just to avoid the awkwardness of “following… following”. <br><br># NITS<br><br>## Section 4.2.4.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; An internationalized target attribute is represented as a member<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the link context object with the same name (including the *) of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the attribute.<br><br>Should be “as the attribute” not “of the attribute”. <br><br>## Section 4.2.4.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; An extension target attribute is represented as a member of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; link target object with the same name of the attribute, including<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the * if applicable.<br><br>Same as above, should be “as the attribute” not “of the attribute”. <br><br>## Appendix A:<br><br>&nbsp;  Figure 19 shows the response of an HTTP GET against the URI of a link<br><br>“response to”</div></td>

 When converting an "application/linkset" document to a field value<br>&nbsp;  for the HTTP "Link" header, newline characters SHOULD be removed in<br>&nbsp;  order to comply with Section 5.5 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics/">I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics</a>].<br><br>Removed, or replaced by SP?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The "application/linkset+json" serialization allows for OPTIONAL<br>&nbsp;  support of a JSON-LD [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] serialization.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  can be achieved by adding an appropriate context to the "application/<br>&nbsp;  linkset+json" serialization using the approach described in<br>&nbsp;  [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Perhaps we want a section reference to [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] here, or<br>to mention specifically the '<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context'">http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context'</a> link<br>relation, to be unambiguous about what behavior we are referencing.<br><br>Section 4.2.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "hreflang": The optional and repeatable "hreflang" target<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attribute MUST be represented by an array (even if there only is<br><br>Does "repeatable" refer to the abstract notion of hreflang attribute (as<br>might have been specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> when it says "multiple hreflang<br>attributes on a single link-value"), or specifically to the encoding of<br>the attribute in the JSON representation?&nbsp; I note that <a href="/doc/rfc8259/">RFC 8259</a> clearly<br>states that the behavior of software is unpredictable in the face of<br>non-unique names in a single object (§4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8259/">RFC 8259</a>), and would be very<br>surprised if we were proposing to have multiple instances of the<br>"hreflang" member in a given link target object.&nbsp; So, I mostly assume that<br>the "repeatable" part is just indicating that the value is an array, so<br>that multiple different values can be reflected, and not that the JSON<br>object member with name "hreflang" is repeatable in the JSON object.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "title": The optional and not repeatable "title" target attribute<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be represented by a "title" member in the link target object,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and its value MUST be a string that follows the same model as in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] syntax.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> says that this string is "in the language indicated by the<br>Content-Language header field (if present)".&nbsp; Do we inherit those<br>semantics as applies to the Content-Language header field on the HTTP<br>message that conveys the link set as its payload?&nbsp; Can we make any<br>provision for cases where linkset documents are reused outside the context<br>of an HTTP interaction?<br><br>Section 4.2.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The character encoding information as prescribed by [<a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC8187</a>] is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not preserved; instead, the content of the internationalized<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attribute is represented in the character encoding used for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JSON set of links.<br><br>I would be very interested to hear why this is believed to be appropriate<br>and correct behavior; <a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC 8187</a> was only published 5 years ago and it's<br>fairly surprising for the field to have shifted so dramatically in so<br>little time.<br><br>Section 4.2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The Web linking model ([<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>]) provides for the use of extension<br>&nbsp;  target attributes as discussed in Section 4.2.4.3.&nbsp; No other form of<br>&nbsp;  extensions SHOULD be used.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This usage of the normative keyword is a somewhat awkward construction,<br>with the intended sense being a negated directive but the keyword being<br>the positive keyword.&nbsp; Perhaps it's worth rephrasing to use "NOT<br>RECOMMENDED"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This limitation of the JSON format allows<br>&nbsp;  to unambiguously round trip between links provided in the HTTP "Link"<br>&nbsp;  header field, sets of links serialized according to the "application/<br>&nbsp;  linkset" format, and sets of links serialized according to the<br>&nbsp;  "application/linkset+json" format.<br><br>I'm not actually convinced that we can unambiguously roundtrip through all<br>constructions that make use of the <a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC 8187</a> character-encoding-escaping<br>mechanism with a JSON encoding that forces "native" encoding (of the<br>containing document) on all internationalized attributes.&nbsp; In particular,<br>I think that the reencoding process would in practice have to pick a<br>particular normalization form, and originals that were encoded in a<br>different normalization form would not roundtrip faithfully.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>The ability to claim that multiple profiles are in use concurrently seems<br>to set us up for a situation where two profiles have conflicting<br>requirements and are both listed in the "profile" parameter of a given<br>message.&nbsp; Should we say anything about how to handle such a situation as a<br>message recipient?<br><br>&nbsp;  The value of the "profile" parameter MUST be a non-empty list of<br>&nbsp;  space-separated URIs, each of which identifies specific constraints<br>&nbsp;  or conventions that apply to the link set document.&nbsp; Profile URIs MAY<br>&nbsp;  be registered in the IANA Profile URI Registry in the manner<br>&nbsp;  specified by [<a href="/doc/rfc7284/">RFC7284</a>].<br><br>It's a little unusual to see a stasndards-track document use a registry<br>established by an ISE document, but I guess there's no point duplicating<br>it if it gets the job done...<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;

 does not participate; it MAY decide to ignore those links.<br><br>"MUST be aware" is a pretty hard requirement to enforce -- is software<br>really even "aware"? :)<br>Perhaps flipping things around a bit, to a declarative statement that the<br>set of links can include unrelated stuff and the user agent MUST process<br>both context and target of each link in the link set independently, and<br>MAY ignore ones deemed irrelevant, would help.&nbsp; (E.g., "There is no<br>requirement that the set of links provided by the resource that is the<br>target of the link contains only links relating to the resource that is<br>the context of the link.&nbsp; User agents MUST process each link in the link<br>set independently, including processing of link context and link target,<br>and MAY ignore links from the link set in which the context of the link<br>(to the link set) does not participate.")<br><br>Section 7.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Figure 14 shows the server's response to the request of Figure 13,<br>&nbsp;  including a "linkset" link with a "profile" attribute that has the<br>&nbsp;  Profile URI&nbsp; as its value.<br>&nbsp;  Dereferencing that URI yields a profile document that lists all the<br>&nbsp;  link relation types that a client can expect when requesting the link<br>&nbsp;  set made discoverable by the "linkset" link.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I am not sure if this is actually a great example to use.<br>I followed the profile URI to look at what link relation types that the<br>profile expects to use, and they all start with "gs1:" as rendered on the<br>page by my browser.&nbsp; Since link relation types (per <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a>) are either<br>registered types or URIs to indicate extension types, that seems to<br>indicate that all these "gs1:activityIdeas", "gs1:allergenInfo", etc.,<br>would need to be URIs, and thus that "gs1:" would be the URI scheme for<br>them.&nbsp; But "gs1" does not seem to be listed as a URI scheme at<br><a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml</a> which<br>leaves me wondering if the example in this document is in some sense<br>"incomplete".&nbsp; Perhaps the intent is that GS1 is actually using "https"<br>scheme URIs like <a href="https://gs1.org/voc/activityIdeas">https://gs1.org/voc/activityIdeas</a> for the relation types<br>(as the "gs1:activityIdeas" text on the profile page is a hyperlink that<br>points to that resource), but there's very little to actually give that<br>indication to me as a reader.<br><br>Section 7.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the response Figure 16 from the link set resource is<br>&nbsp;  equivalent to the response shown in Figure 17, which leverages the<br>&nbsp;  "profile" link relation type defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc6906/">RFC6906</a>].<br><br>In general there's a disincentive to provide multiple equivalent ways to<br>do the same thing, as it tends to require endpoints to implement all<br>alternatives in order to ensure interoperability.&nbsp; What's the motivation<br>for offering both a dedicated link relation type and the media type<br>parameter for the linkset media types, versus just one or the other?<br><br>Section 9<br><br>I might consider noting that this specification is strict about certain<br>JSON elements always being encoded as arrays even when there is only a<br>single item, which simplifies parsers and provides some modest reduction<br>in risk as relates to implementation bugs.&nbsp; It's not a terribly important<br>consideration, though.<br><br>&nbsp;  The security considerations of Web Linking [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] apply, as long<br>&nbsp;  as they are not specifically discussing the risks of exposing<br>&nbsp;  information in HTTP header fields.<br><br>The paragraph about '''Link header fields that use the "anchor" parameter<br>to associate a link's context with another resource cannot be trusted<br>since they are effectively assertions by a third party that could be<br>incorrect or malicious [...]''' from 8288 seems particularly relevant and<br>might be worth highlighting specifically.&nbsp; (I do see the final bullet<br>point of this section, that is related.)<br><br>&nbsp;  and may not be sufficiently protected.&nbsp; Ideally, none of the URIs<br>&nbsp;  exposed in links should be supposed to be "hidden"; instead, if these<br>&nbsp;  URIs are supposed to be limited to certain users, then technical<br>&nbsp;  measures should be put in place so that accidentally exposing them<br>&nbsp;  does not cause any harm.<br><br>Here we say "if these URIs are supposed to be limited", but do we mean<br>"the resources identified by these URIs"?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The Web Linking model always has an "implicit context", which is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the resource of the HTTP interaction.&nbsp; This original context can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be lost or can change when self-contained link representations are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moved.&nbsp; Changing the context can change the interpretation of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links when they have no explicit anchor, or when they use relative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; URIs.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I feel like it would be appropriate to highlight that changing the context<br>is likely to change the semantics indicated by the link (and thus break<br>the intended meaning), such that the default/safe behavior needs to be to<br>ignore such links unless there is a reliable source of link context<br>external to the document itself.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The model introduced in this specification supports "3rd party<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links", where one party can provide links that have another<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; party's resource as an anchor.&nbsp; Depending on the link semantics<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the application context, it is important to verify that there<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is sufficient trust in that 3rd party to allow it to provide these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>In the vein of my earlier comment, I think it would be helpful to supply<br>some additional background/context on the topic, maybe in this part of the<br>text, or maybe elsewhere.&nbsp; I'm thinking something like:<br><br>% There is no fundamental notion of "authority" for a third party to<br>% provide links about resources other than itself.&nbsp; In the original<br>% [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] Web Linking model, links are provided with an implicit<br>% context that is the resource providing a link (though an explicit<br>% context can sometimes be provided instead).&nbsp; In that model, a resource<br>% is inherently the authority for its own links, and a certain amount of<br>% trust can be placed in the provided links.&nbsp; There is no such inherent<br>% trust when third-party links are used, and so in order for third-party<br>% links (as specified in this document) to be trustworthy, an external<br>% source of trust is needed.&nbsp; This might be achieved in an out-of-band<br>% manner, with a given client configured to trust a particular entity to<br>% provide links about a certain class of resources, or by various implicit<br>% means.&nbsp; For example, if a resource provides a link of relation type<br>% "linkset", that might be seen as a delegation of authority for providing<br>% trustworty link information to the target of the "linkset" link (subject<br>% to the caveats in Section 7.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] about the lack of reliability<br>% and consistency of a resource identified by a URI), at least for links<br>% that relate to the original resource, and [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] proposes that some<br>% applications might be willing to treat "share the same authority [URI<br>% component]" as an indication that a link relating a different resource<br>% might be trustworthy.&nbsp; The notion of "trust" in a link is a complicated<br>% subject, and there is no single approach for it that applies universally<br>% to all applications.<br><br>Section 10<br><br>Since <a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a> is mentioned only to make a contrast to the mechanisms<br>defined in this document, it seems better classified as an informative<br>reference.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>I agree with Roman that [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] is more properly<br>classified as a normative reference.<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>(I don't know much about JSON-LD or Dublin Core Terms, so my review of<br>this part was pretty superficial.)<br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Each link context object MAY contain an "anchor" member with a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value that represents the link context.&nbsp; If present, this value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be a URI reference and SHOULD NOT be a relative reference as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; per Section 4.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>].<br><br>It's easy to parse this statement as saying that <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> is providing<br>support for the "SHOULD NOT" requirement, whereas we're really just using<br>it as the reference for "relative reference".&nbsp; Maybe s/per/defined in/, or<br>just "relative reference (Section 4.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>])"?<br>(The phrasing/construct in question appears later on as well, though I'll<br>just remark on it once, here.)</div></td>

I have some more thoughts in the<br>section-by-section comments.<br><br>I made a pull request on github with some editorial suggestions:<br><a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/linkset/pull/64">https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/linkset/pull/64</a> .<br>There is perhaps a non-editorial change in the description of the<br>"hreflang" JSON representation, though I would argue that in essence it<br>is editorial since it just brings that definition in line with its sibling<br>elements' definitions.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When converting an "application/linkset" document to a field value<br>&nbsp;  for the HTTP "Link" header, newline characters SHOULD be removed in<br>&nbsp;  order to comply with Section 5.5 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics/">I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics</a>].<br><br>Removed, or replaced by SP?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The "application/linkset+json" serialization allows for OPTIONAL<br>&nbsp;  support of a JSON-LD [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] serialization.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  can be achieved by adding an appropriate context to the "application/<br>&nbsp;  linkset+json" serialization using the approach described in<br>&nbsp;  [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Perhaps we want a section reference to [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] here, or<br>to mention specifically the '<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context'">http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context'</a> link<br>relation, to be unambiguous about what behavior we are referencing.<br><br>Section 4.2.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "hreflang": The optional and repeatable "hreflang" target<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attribute MUST be represented by an array (even if there only is<br><br>Does "repeatable" refer to the abstract notion of hreflang attribute (as<br>might have been specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> when it says "multiple hreflang<br>attributes on a single link-value"), or specifically to the encoding of<br>the attribute in the JSON representation?&nbsp; I note that <a href="/doc/rfc8259/">RFC 8259</a> clearly<br>states that the behavior of software is unpredictable in the face of<br>non-unique names in a single object (§4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8259/">RFC 8259</a>), and would be very<br>surprised if we were proposing to have multiple instances of the<br>"hreflang" member in a given link target object.&nbsp; So, I mostly assume that<br>the "repeatable" part is just indicating that the value is an array, so<br>that multiple different values can be reflected, and not that the JSON<br>object member with name "hreflang" is repeatable in the JSON object.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; "title": The optional and not repeatable "title" target attribute<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be represented by a "title" member in the link target object,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and its value MUST be a string that follows the same model as in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] syntax.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> says that this string is "in the language indicated by the<br>Content-Language header field (if present)".&nbsp; Do we inherit those<br>semantics as applies to the Content-Language header field on the HTTP<br>message that conveys the link set as its payload?&nbsp; Can we make any<br>provision for cases where linkset documents are reused outside the context<br>of an HTTP interaction?<br><br>Section 4.2.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The character encoding information as prescribed by [<a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC8187</a>] is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not preserved; instead, the content of the internationalized<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attribute is represented in the character encoding used for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JSON set of links.<br><br>I would be very interested to hear why this is believed to be appropriate<br>and correct behavior; <a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC 8187</a> was only published 5 years ago and it's<br>fairly surprising for the field to have shifted so dramatically in so<br>little time.<br><br>Section 4.2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The Web linking model ([<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>]) provides for the use of extension<br>&nbsp;  target attributes as discussed in Section 4.2.4.3.&nbsp; No other form of<br>&nbsp;  extensions SHOULD be used.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This usage of the normative keyword is a somewhat awkward construction,<br>with the intended sense being a negated directive but the keyword being<br>the positive keyword.&nbsp; Perhaps it's worth rephrasing to use "NOT<br>RECOMMENDED"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This limitation of the JSON format allows<br>&nbsp;  to unambiguously round trip between links provided in the HTTP "Link"<br>&nbsp;  header field, sets of links serialized according to the "application/<br>&nbsp;  linkset" format, and sets of links serialized according to the<br>&nbsp;  "application/linkset+json" format.<br><br>I'm not actually convinced that we can unambiguously roundtrip through all<br>constructions that make use of the <a href="/doc/rfc8187/">RFC 8187</a> character-encoding-escaping<br>mechanism with a JSON encoding that forces "native" encoding (of the<br>containing document) on all internationalized attributes.&nbsp; In particular,<br>I think that the reencoding process would in practice have to pick a<br>particular normalization form, and originals that were encoded in a<br>different normalization form would not roundtrip faithfully.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>The ability to claim that multiple profiles are in use concurrently seems<br>to set us up for a situation where two profiles have conflicting<br>requirements and are both listed in the "profile" parameter of a given<br>message.&nbsp; Should we say anything about how to handle such a situation as a<br>message recipient?<br><br>&nbsp;  The value of the "profile" parameter MUST be a non-empty list of<br>&nbsp;  space-separated URIs, each of which identifies specific constraints<br>&nbsp;  or conventions that apply to the link set document.&nbsp; Profile URIs MAY<br>&nbsp;  be registered in the IANA Profile URI Registry in the manner<br>&nbsp;  specified by [<a href="/doc/rfc7284/">RFC7284</a>].<br><br>It's a little unusual to see a stasndards-track document use a registry<br>established by an ISE document, but I guess there's no point duplicating<br>it if it gets the job done...<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  A user agent that follows a "linkset" link MUST be aware that the set<br>&nbsp;  of links provided by the resource that is the target of the link can<br>&nbsp;  contain links in which the resource that is the context of the link<br>&nbsp;  does not participate; it MAY decide to ignore those links.<br><br>"MUST be aware" is a pretty hard requirement to enforce -- is software<br>really even "aware"? :)<br>Perhaps flipping things around a bit, to a declarative statement that the<br>set of links can include unrelated stuff and the user agent MUST process<br>both context and target of each link in the link set independently, and<br>MAY ignore ones deemed irrelevant, would help.&nbsp; (E.g., "There is no<br>requirement that the set of links provided by the resource that is the<br>target of the link contains only links relating to the resource that is<br>the context of the link.&nbsp; User agents MUST process each link in the link<br>set independently, including processing of link context and link target,<br>and MAY ignore links from the link set in which the context of the link<br>(to the link set) does not participate.")<br><br>Section 7.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Figure 14 shows the server's response to the request of Figure 13,<br>&nbsp;  including a "linkset" link with a "profile" attribute that has the<br>&nbsp;  Profile URI&nbsp; as its value.<br>&nbsp;  Dereferencing that URI yields a profile document that lists all the<br>&nbsp;  link relation types that a client can expect when requesting the link<br>&nbsp;  set made discoverable by the "linkset" link.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I am not sure if this is actually a great example to use.<br>I followed the profile URI to look at what link relation types that the<br>profile expects to use, and they all start with "gs1:" as rendered on the<br>page by my browser.&nbsp; Since link relation types (per <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a>) are either<br>registered types or URIs to indicate extension types, that seems to<br>indicate that all these "gs1:activityIdeas", "gs1:allergenInfo", etc.,<br>would need to be URIs, and thus that "gs1:" would be the URI scheme for<br>them.&nbsp; But "gs1" does not seem to be listed as a URI scheme at<br><a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml</a> which<br>leaves me wondering if the example in this document is in some sense<br>"incomplete".&nbsp; Perhaps the intent is that GS1 is actually using "https"<br>scheme URIs like <a href="https://gs1.org/voc/activityIdeas">https://gs1.org/voc/activityIdeas</a> for the relation types<br>(as the "gs1:activityIdeas" text on the profile page is a hyperlink that<br>points to that resource), but there's very little to actually give that<br>indication to me as a reader.<br><br>Section 7.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the response Figure 16 from the link set resource is<br>&nbsp;  equivalent to the response shown in Figure 17, which leverages the<br>&nbsp;  "profile" link relation type defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc6906/">RFC6906</a>].<br><br>In general there's a disincentive to provide multiple equivalent ways to<br>do the same thing, as it tends to require endpoints to implement all<br>alternatives in order to ensure interoperability.&nbsp; What's the motivation<br>for offering both a dedicated link relation type and the media type<br>parameter for the linkset media types, versus just one or the other?<br><br>Section 9<br><br>I might consider noting that this specification is strict about certain<br>JSON elements always being encoded as arrays even when there is only a<br>single item, which simplifies parsers and provides some modest reduction<br>in risk as relates to implementation bugs.&nbsp; It's not a terribly important<br>consideration, though.<br><br>&nbsp;  The security considerations of Web Linking [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] apply, as long<br>&nbsp;  as they are not specifically discussing the risks of exposing<br>&nbsp;  information in HTTP header fields.<br><br>The paragraph about '''Link header fields that use the "anchor" parameter<br>to associate a link's context with another resource cannot be trusted<br>since they are effectively assertions by a third party that could be<br>incorrect or malicious [...]''' from 8288 seems particularly relevant and<br>might be worth highlighting specifically.&nbsp; (I do see the final bullet<br>point of this section, that is related.)<br><br>&nbsp;  and may not be sufficiently protected.&nbsp; Ideally, none of the URIs<br>&nbsp;  exposed in links should be supposed to be "hidden"; instead, if these<br>&nbsp;  URIs are supposed to be limited to certain users, then technical<br>&nbsp;  measures should be put in place so that accidentally exposing them<br>&nbsp;  does not cause any harm.<br><br>Here we say "if these URIs are supposed to be limited", but do we mean<br>"the resources identified by these URIs"?<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The Web Linking model always has an "implicit context", which is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the resource of the HTTP interaction.&nbsp; This original context can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be lost or can change when self-contained link representations are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moved.&nbsp; Changing the context can change the interpretation of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links when they have no explicit anchor, or when they use relative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; URIs.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I feel like it would be appropriate to highlight that changing the context<br>is likely to change the semantics indicated by the link (and thus break<br>the intended meaning), such that the default/safe behavior needs to be to<br>ignore such links unless there is a reliable source of link context<br>external to the document itself.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The model introduced in this specification supports "3rd party<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links", where one party can provide links that have another<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; party's resource as an anchor.&nbsp; Depending on the link semantics<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the application context, it is important to verify that there<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is sufficient trust in that 3rd party to allow it to provide these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; links.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>In the vein of my earlier comment, I think it would be helpful to supply<br>some additional background/context on the topic, maybe in this part of the<br>text, or maybe elsewhere.&nbsp; I'm thinking something like:<br><br>% There is no fundamental notion of "authority" for a third party to<br>% provide links about resources other than itself.&nbsp; In the original<br>% [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] Web Linking model, links are provided with an implicit<br>% context that is the resource providing a link (though an explicit<br>% context can sometimes be provided instead).&nbsp; In that model, a resource<br>% is inherently the authority for its own links, and a certain amount of<br>% trust can be placed in the provided links.&nbsp; There is no such inherent<br>% trust when third-party links are used, and so in order for third-party<br>% links (as specified in this document) to be trustworthy, an external<br>% source of trust is needed.&nbsp; This might be achieved in an out-of-band<br>% manner, with a given client configured to trust a particular entity to<br>% provide links about a certain class of resources, or by various implicit<br>% means.&nbsp; For example, if a resource provides a link of relation type<br>% "linkset", that might be seen as a delegation of authority for providing<br>% trustworty link information to the target of the "linkset" link (subject<br>% to the caveats in Section 7.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] about the lack of reliability<br>% and consistency of a resource identified by a URI), at least for links<br>% that relate to the original resource, and [<a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC8288</a>] proposes that some<br>% applications might be willing to treat "share the same authority [URI<br>% component]" as an indication that a link relating a different resource<br>% might be trustworthy.&nbsp; The notion of "trust" in a link is a complicated<br>% subject, and there is no single approach for it that applies universally<br>% to all applications.<br><br>Section 10<br><br>Since <a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a> is mentioned only to make a contrast to the mechanisms<br>defined in this document, it seems better classified as an informative<br>reference.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>I agree with Roman that [W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116] is more properly<br>classified as a normative reference.<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>(I don't know much about JSON-LD or Dublin Core Terms, so my review of<br>this part was pretty superficial.)<br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Each link context object MAY contain an "anchor" member with a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value that represents the link context.&nbsp; If present, this value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be a URI reference and SHOULD NOT be a relative reference as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; per Section 4.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>].<br><br>It's easy to parse this statement as saying that <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> is providing<br>support for the "SHOULD NOT" requirement, whereas we're really just using<br>it as the reference for "relative reference".&nbsp; Maybe s/per/defined in/, or<br>just "relative reference (Section 4.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>])"?<br>(The phrasing/construct in question appears later on as well, though I'll<br>just remark on it once, here.)</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is Proposed Standard and is reflected on the title page.<br><br>&gt;(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&gt;Technical Summary:<br>&gt;Document Quality:<br>&gt;Personnel:<br><br>This specification defines two formats and respective media types for<br>representing sets of links as stand-alone documents.&nbsp; One format is<br>JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links<br>in the HTTP "Link" header field.&nbsp; This specification also introduces<br>a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links. This is intended<br>to be used when <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> links are not usable, and delivering a set of links<br>as a stand-alone document is preferable.<br><br>This is a product of the HTTPAPI working group.<br><br>The document had detailed review from many WG members and while there<br>was some discussion, there was nothing especially controversial, nor rough<br>points in any consensus issues.<br><br>There are several implementations existing and planned. These are noted in<br>Appendix B of the draft, which will be removed before publication as an RFC.<br><br>This was originally set to be Informational, but following a question<br>from one of the Directorate reviews, and confirmation on the mailing<br>list, this document was changed to Proposed Standard.<br><br>The shepherd for this document was Rich Salz; the responsible AD is Francesca<br>Palombini.<br><br>&gt;(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>There are two old RFC references which can be fixed during AUTH48 or earlier:<br>6982 -&gt; 7942 and 5988 -&gt; 8288.<br><br>The JSON samples have data after the opening brace, but that's also can be<br>fixed in AUTH48 :)<br><br>I re-read the document carefully and it is ready for publication. It does a<br>nice job providing use cases and motivation for this work.<br><br>&gt;(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.&nbsp; In particular Julian Reschke (noted HTTP RFC editor) provided a detailed<br>review.<br><br>&gt;(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It might be useful to have the HTTP WG look at this. Given the overlap of<br>the groups's memberships, and the reviews it is already had, I am pretty<br>confident that no new issues will be raised.<br><br>&gt;(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Absolutely none.<br><br>&gt;(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, both authors said they are not aware of any IPR.<br><br>&gt;(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Low-level general agreement. All agree this is a worthwhile problem to<br>address. Nobody objected to any decisions made while writing the document.<br><br>&gt;(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>See #3 above.<br><br>&gt;(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The IANA considerations section (8) identifies one link relation and two media<br>types. Those applications, in the draft, appear to be complete.<br><br>&gt;(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt;(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>There are none.<br><br>&gt;(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.&nbsp; UPDATED MARCH 1:<br><br>When the document was changed from Informational to Proposed Standard, and resubmitted, two downward references were created and not caught by the tooling:<br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc6906/">RFC 6906</a><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6906/">RFC6906</a>]&nbsp; Wilde, E., "The 'profile' Link Relation Type", <a href="/doc/rfc6906/">RFC 6906</a>,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DOI 10.17487/RFC6906, March 2013,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7284/">RFC 7284</a><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7284/">RFC7284</a>]&nbsp; Lanthaler, M., "The Profile URI Registry", <a href="/doc/rfc7284/">RFC 7284</a>,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DOI 10.17487/RFC7284, June 2014,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br> <br><br>&gt;(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>I would suggest that this gets an "Updates 8288" mention.<br><br>&gt;(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The draft proposes three additions to existing registries and the additions<br>look complete. Once the responsible AD is satisfied with the draft, we could<br>ask the registrars to review them.<br><br>&gt;(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>&gt;(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>doc-nits but the rest is text. I tried to carefully read the JSON examples.<br><br>&gt;(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft has no YANG in it.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is Proposed Standard and is reflected on the title page.<br><br>&gt;(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&gt;Technical Summary:<br>&gt;Document Quality:<br>&gt;Personnel:<br><br>This specification defines two formats and respective media types for<br>representing sets of links as stand-alone documents.&nbsp; One format is<br>JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links<br>in the HTTP "Link" header field.&nbsp; This specification also introduces<br>a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links. This is intended<br>to be used when <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> links are not usable, and delivering a set of links<br>as a stand-alone document is preferable.<br><br>This is a product of the HTTPAPI working group.<br><br>The document had detailed review from many WG members and while there<br>was some discussion, there was nothing especially controversial, nor rough<br>points in any consensus issues.<br><br>There are several implementations existing and planned. These are noted in<br>Appendix B of the draft, which will be removed before publication as an RFC.<br><br>This was originally set to be Informational, but following a question<br>from one of the Directorate reviews, and confirmation on the mailing<br>list, this document was changed to Proposed Standard.<br><br>The shepherd for this document was Rich Salz; the responsible AD is Francesca<br>Palombini.<br><br>&gt;(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>There are two old RFC references which can be fixed during AUTH48 or earlier:<br>6982 -&gt; 7942 and 5988 -&gt; 8288.<br><br>The JSON samples have data after the opening brace, but that's also can be<br>fixed in AUTH48 :)<br><br>I re-read the document carefully and it is ready for publication. It does a<br>nice job providing use cases and motivation for this work.<br><br>&gt;(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.&nbsp; In particular Julian Reschke (noted HTTP RFC editor) provided a detailed<br>review.<br><br>&gt;(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It might be useful to have the HTTP WG look at this. Given the overlap of<br>the groups's memberships, and the reviews it is already had, I am pretty<br>confident that no new issues will be raised.<br><br>&gt;(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Absolutely none.<br><br>&gt;(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, both authors said they are not aware of any IPR.<br><br>&gt;(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Low-level general agreement. All agree this is a worthwhile problem to<br>address. Nobody objected to any decisions made while writing the document.<br><br>&gt;(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>See #3 above.<br><br>&gt;(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The IANA considerations section (8) identifies one link relation and two media<br>types. Those applications, in the draft, appear to be complete.<br><br>&gt;(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt;(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>There are none.<br><br>&gt;(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>I would suggest that this gets an "Updates 8288" mention.<br><br>&gt;(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The draft proposes three additions to existing registries and the additions<br>look complete. Once the responsible AD is satisfied with the draft, we could<br>ask the registrars to review them.<br><br>&gt;(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>&gt;(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>doc-nits but the rest is text. I tried to carefully read the JSON examples.<br><br>&gt;(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft has no YANG in it.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is a Informational and is reflected on the title page.<br><br>&gt;(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&gt;Technical Summary:<br>&gt;Document Quality:<br>&gt;Personnel:<br><br>This specification defines two formats and respective media types for<br>representing sets of links as stand-alone documents.&nbsp; One format is<br>JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links<br>in the HTTP "Link" header field.&nbsp; This specification also introduces<br>a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links. This is intended<br>to be used when <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> links are not usable, and delivering a set of links<br>as a stand-alone document is preferable.<br><br>This is a product of the HTTPAPI working group.<br><br>The document had detailed review from many WG members and while there<br>was some discussion, there was nothing especially controversial, nor rough<br>points in any consensus issues.<br><br>There are several implementations existing and planned. These are noted in<br>Appendix B of the draft, which will be removed before publication as an RFC.<br><br>The shepherd for this document was Rich Salz; the responsible AD is Francesca<br>Palombini.<br><br>&gt;(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>There are two old RFC references which can be fixed during AUTH48 or earlier:<br>6982 -&gt; 7942 and 5988 -&gt; 8288.<br><br>The JSON samples have data after the opening brace, but that's also can be<br>fixed in AUTH48 :)<br><br>I re-read the document carefully and it is ready for publication. It does a<br>nice job providing use cases and motivation for this work.<br><br>&gt;(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.&nbsp; In particular Julian Reschke (noted HTTP RFC editor) provided a detailed<br>review.<br><br>&gt;(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It might be useful to have the HTTP WG look at this. Given the overlap of<br>the groups's memberships, and the reviews it is already had, I am pretty<br>confident that no new issues will be raised.<br><br>&gt;(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Absolutely none.<br><br>&gt;(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, both authors said they are not aware of any IPR.<br><br>&gt;(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Low-level general agreement. All agree this is a worthwhile problem to<br>address. Nobody objected to any decisions made while writing the document.<br><br>&gt;(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>See #3 above.<br><br>&gt;(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The IANA considerations section (8) identifies one link relation and two media<br>types. Those applications, in the draft, appear to be complete.<br><br>&gt;(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt;(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>There are none.<br><br>&gt;(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>I would suggest that this gets an "Updates 8288" mention.<br><br>&gt;(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The draft proposes three additions to existing registries and the additions<br>look complete. Once the responsible AD is satisfied with the draft, we could<br>ask the registrars to review them.<br><br>&gt;(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>&gt;(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>doc-nits but the rest is text. I tried to carefully read the JSON examples.<br><br>&gt;(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft has no YANG in it.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is a Informational and is reflected on the title page.<br><br>&gt;(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>&gt;Technical Summary:<br>&gt;Document Quality:<br>&gt;Personnel:<br><br>This specification defines two formats and respective media types for<br>representing sets of links as stand-alone documents.&nbsp; One format is<br>JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links<br>in the HTTP "Link" header field.&nbsp; This specification also introduces<br>a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links. This is intended<br>to be used when <a href="/doc/rfc8288/">RFC 8288</a> links are not usable, and delivering a set of links<br>as a stand-alone document is preferable.<br><br>This is a product of the HTTPAPI working group.<br><br>The document had detailed review from many WG members and while there<br>was some discussion, there was nothing especially controversial, nor rough<br>points in any consensus issues.<br><br>There are several implementations existing and planned. These are noted in<br>Appendix B of the draft, which will be removed before publication as an RFC.<br><br>The shepherd for this document was Rich Salz; the responsible AD is Francesca<br>Palombini.<br><br>&gt;(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>There are two old RFC references which can be fixed during AUTH48 or earlier:<br>6982 -&gt; 7942 and 5988 -&gt; 8288.<br><br>The JSON samples have data after the opening brace, but that's also can be<br>fixed in AUTH48 :)<br><br>I re-read the document carefully and it is ready for publication. It does a<br>nice job providing use cases and motivation for this work.<br><br>&gt;(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.&nbsp; In particular Julian Reschke (noted HTTP RFC editor) provided a detailed<br>review.<br><br>&gt;(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It might be useful to have the HTTP WG look at this. Given the overlap of<br>the groups's memberships, and the reviews it is already had, I am pretty<br>confident that no new issues will be raised.<br><br>&gt;(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>Absolutely none.<br><br>&gt;(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, both authors said they are not aware of any IPR.<br><br>&gt;(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Low-level general agreement. All agree this is a worthwhile problem to<br>address. Nobody objected to any decisions made while writing the document.<br><br>&gt;(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>See #3 above.<br><br>&gt;(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The IANA considerations section (8) identifies one link relation and two media<br>types. Those applications, in the draft, appear to be complete.<br><br>&gt;(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt;(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>There are none.<br><br>&gt;(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt;(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>I would suggest that this gets an "Updates 8288" mention.<br><br>&gt;(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The draft proposes three additions to existing registries and the additions<br>look complete. Once the responsible AD is satisfied with the draft, we could<br>ask the registrars to review them.<br><br>&gt;(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>&gt;(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>doc-nits but the rest is text. I tried to carefully read the JSON examples.<br><br>&gt;(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The draft has no YANG in it.<br></div></td>
