I haven't chosen to make them blocking by including them in my DISCUSS; nonetheless I would appreciate replies to them.<br><br>1. I agree with the comments by several of the other reviewers, that there are just too many gratuitous acronyms in this document. They aren't the only thing that makes it hard to read, but they certainly contribute. I'm disappointed to see this hasn't been addressed between versions -09 and -14. It would have been a small matter of search-and-replace to go through and expand most of the acronyms.<br><br>2. Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>3. Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; references to ARP table in the context of asymmetric IRB is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logical view of a forwarding table that maintains an IP to MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; binding entry on a layer 3 interface for both IPv4 and IPv6.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These entries are not subject to ARP or ND protocol.<br>```<br><br>This passage shines a spotlight on the fact that “ARP table” as it’s used in this document is a misnomer, since it’s a table that is not (necessarily) populated by ARP. I don’t propose that you change the nomenclature, since it’s firmly established even though wrong — but it might be worth adding the first sentence or one like it to your Terminology section.<br><br>4. Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 depicts BT2 being present on the ingress PE, but the text makes it clear that in the symmetric mode that this figure depicts, BT2 doesn’t actually need to be there. Wouldn’t it be clearer if you didn’t show it?<br><br>5. Section 4<br><br>I have a hard time parsing this text:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each BT on a PE is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a unique VLAN (e.g., with a BD)<br>```<br><br>So, 1 VLAN —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where in turn it is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a single MAC-VRF<br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of VLAN-Based mode or a<br>&nbsp;  number of BTs can be associated with a single MAC-VRF in the case of<br>&nbsp;  VLAN-Aware Bundle mode.&nbsp; <br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>Since this is stated as an exception I guess that means you meant the preceding two (that I parsed as 1:many) are actually supposed to be 1:1? If so I think this needs a rewrite (it probably does regardless, for clarity). <br><br>6. Section 4.1<br><br>When you write “Internet standard bit order“, do you mean “network byte order“? Although even network byte order appears to be non-applicable, since the values are shown with an explicit byte order. <br><br>I realize the definitions are merely pasted from <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a> and that ship has sailed, but unless you can explain what “(in hex, in Internet standard bit-order)” is supposed to mean, I suggest removing it. (Alternately and less desirably, make it explicit that you’re providing a direct quotation of <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a>.)<br><br>7. Section 5.1<br><br>You say the Encapsulation Extended Community and Router’s MAC Extended Community have to be sent, but you say nothing about the required values. For Router's MAC, §8.1 specifies the required value, I suggest a forward reference to it. For Encapsulation, the closest I was able to find to a place where this is specified was section 9.1.1, but that's only an example. There really needs to be some place where it's spelled out. A bare minimum would be to cite <a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC 9012</a> §4.1, but that just provides the syntax -- you really should say something more about how to decide what value to send. For that matter, it could be what valueS to send -- is it legal for a NVE to advertise multiple Encapsulation Extended Communities? You don't say it isn't, and there are potential reasons to do so.<br><br>8. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using MAC-VRF Route Target (and Ethernet Tag if different from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zero), it identifies the corresponding MAC-VRF (and BT).&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC- VRF (and BT) exists (e.g., it is locally configured) then it<br>```<br><br>You use “e.g.” so I presume there might be other reasons the MAC-VRF and BT might exist even if not locally configured?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imports the MAC address into it.&nbsp; Otherwise, it does not import<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC address.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using IP-VRF route target, it identifies the corresponding IP-VRF<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and imports the IP address into it.<br>```<br><br>You don’t provide any conditional language in this bullet about “if the IP-VRF exists”. Why is that caveat required for MAC-VRF but not for IP-VRF?<br><br>9. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The inclusion of MPLS label2 field in this route signals to the<br>&nbsp;  receiving PE that this route is for symmetric IRB mode and MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 needs to be installed in forwarding path to identify the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding IP-VRF.<br>```<br><br>I was unable to make head nor tail of this paragraph. I suppose §5.4 is where the behavior is actually specified, so in a way it doesn’t matter (although maybe a forward reference would help). <br><br>10. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives this route with both the MAC-VRF and IP-<br>&nbsp;  VRF route targets and if the receiving PE does not support either<br>&nbsp;  asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then if it has the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  MAC-VRF, it only imports the MAC address.&nbsp; Otherwise, if it doesn't<br>&nbsp;  have the corresponding MAC-VRF, it must not import this route.<br>```<br><br>If it doesn’t support either asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then doesn’t that mean it doesn’t implement this specification at all? In that circumstance, how do you expect your “must not” to be respected?<br><br>11. Section 5.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If host B's (MAC, IP) has not yet been<br>&nbsp;  learnt either via a gratuitous ARP OR via a prior gleaning procedure,<br>&nbsp;  a new gleaning procedure MUST be triggered<br>```<br><br>Since you’ve used MUST here, you MUST provide a reference to where the “new gleaning procedure” is specified. <br><br>Also, has not been learnt by whom? The procedure must be triggered where?<br><br>12. Section 5.3<br><br>The second paragraph, that begins "Consider a subnet A", is tremendously confusing to a first-time reader (or at least to this first-time reader). I realize you probably think you're being helpful by providing a worked example, but as I read through it, it was the opposite of helpful. This is especially true because §5 and its subsections is about "Symmetric IRB Procedures" -- and the paragraph in question provides no procedures.<br><br>Some options to improve the situation --<br><br>- Remove the paragraph entirely.<br>- Preface the paragraph with "as an example to show why advertisement as RT-5 is required,"<br><br>13. Section 5.4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; global mode: VNI is set to the received label2 in the route which<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is domain-wide assigned.&nbsp; This VNI value from received label2 MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be the same as the locally configured VNI for the IP VRF as all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PEs in the NVO MUST be configured with the same IP VRF VNI for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this mode of operation.<br>```<br><br>What action is to be taken if this MUST is violated?<br><br>14. Section 6.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  For asymmetric IRB mode, Router's MAC EC is not needed because<br>```<br><br>Please either expand “EC” or add it to your definitions section. (Also applies to 5.1)<br><br>15. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If only MAC-VRF route target is used, then the receiving PE uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC-VRF route target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.e., many MAC-VRF route targets map to the same IP-VRF for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; given tenant.&nbsp; In this case, MAC-VRF may be used by the receiving<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PE to identify the corresponding IP VRF<br>```<br><br>Do you mean “in this case, the MAC-VRF *route target* may be used…”?<br><br>16. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives the MAC/IP Advertisement route with MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 field and it uses symmetric IRB mode<br>```<br><br>This entire section is entitled “asymmetric IRB procedures“. Why is there specification language regarding symmetric procedures in it? (I’m pretty sure this is not the only place this kind of problem appears.)<br><br>17. Section 7.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  On the source NVE, an age-out timer (for the silent host that has<br>&nbsp;  moved) is used to trigger an ARP probe.&nbsp; This age-out timer can be<br>&nbsp;  either ARP timer or MAC age-out timer and this is an implementation<br>&nbsp;  choice.&nbsp; The ARP request gets sent both locally to all the attached<br>&nbsp;  TSes on that subnet as well as it gets sent to all the remote NVEs<br>&nbsp;  (including the target NVE) participating in that subnet.&nbsp; The source<br>&nbsp;  NVE also withdraw the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route with only the<br>&nbsp;  MAC address (if it has previously advertised such a route).<br>```<br><br>Wouldn’t the source NVE only withdraw the route after a timeout had expired? As you have written this paragraph, in case the silent TS has not moved, the following would happen:<br><br>```<br>Time t: age-out timer fires, ARP probe is sent<br>Time t: NVE withdraws route advertisement<br>Time u &gt; t: TS receives ARP probe, sends ARP reply<br>Time v &gt; u: NVE receives ARP reply<br>Time v: NVE re-advertises route<br>```<br><br>Presumably this churn isn’t what you intended. <br><br>18. Section 9.2<br><br>How does the NVE learn what subnets are behind its attached TS? <br><br>19. Section 9.2<br><br>What about if TS4 wants to reach SN1? How does it know where to send the packet? (I suppose the answer may be the same as for #18.)</div></td>

Copying my (resolved) discuss points here for posterity.<br><br>--<br>I found this document difficult to review. Some of this might be due to the fact that I'm not an expert on EVPN, but I think some of the reason is that the document could be structured better and expressed more clearly. The only reason I'm not opposing progression of the document on the grounds that it's too unclear to implement is that I've been told, and accept on faith, that implementations *have* been successfully written starting from the spec, which implies it's implementable -- I guess by people who are expert in EVPN already, it wouldn't be implementable by me.<br><br>In any case, I do have some points I would like to discuss, that are more actionable.<br><br>1. I agree with Robert Wilton's comment on -09:<br><br>```<br>One question I have is whether it is possible to have a deployment where some devices support synchronous mode and others support asynchronous mode.&nbsp; Am I right in presuming that this is not supported and if so is this capability signaled in any way? Or is the expectation that this would be controlled via deployment choice of network device, or though configuration management?<br>```<br><br>This issue still exists in -14. I think it should be addressed in the document. Similarly, I agree with Warren Kumari's comment, also on -09:<br><br>```<br>I would strongly recommend that the authors read the OpsDir review at: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding-09-opsdir-lc-jaeggli-2020-07-06/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding-09-opsdir-lc-jaeggli-2020-07-06/</a> , especially the: "it would be helpful if section 4 would be more explicit for non-implementors on when symetric or asymetric modules would be chosen, as it stands the variation basically reads like the enumeration of the features of various implementations." comment (which I fully agree with).<br>```<br><br>It seems both of these comments could -- and should! -- be addressed by adding a few paragraphs talking about these topics. This could be done either in §4, as Warren suggests, or in some other section (e.g. you could add an "operational considerations" section).<br><br>2. Section 7.1<br><br>I’m guessing this question isn’t unique to this document, but since this is where I encountered it, I’ll ask: it seems as though the described mobility procedures are vulnerable to a condition where a particular (IP, MAC) appears at two different NVEs at the same time. If this condition exists (either innocently, or maliciously) what prevents the source and target NVEs from continually attempting to claim the (IP, MAC) from one another, flooding the network with updates all the while?<br><br>(This applies to 7.2 as well.)<br><br>Since this seems like a potential security issue, I'm including it in my DISCUSS.<br>--<br><br>Below are a number of questions and comments that I hope might help improve the document. I haven't chosen to make them blocking by including them in my DISCUSS; nonetheless I would appreciate replies to them.<br><br>1. I agree with the comments by several of the other reviewers, that there are just too many gratuitous acronyms in this document. They aren't the only thing that makes it hard to read, but they certainly contribute. I'm disappointed to see this hasn't been addressed between versions -09 and -14. It would have been a small matter of search-and-replace to go through and expand most of the acronyms.<br><br>2. Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>3.

I agree with the comments by several of the other reviewers, that there are just too many gratuitous acronyms in this document. They aren't the only thing that makes it hard to read, but they certainly contribute. I'm disappointed to see this hasn't been addressed between versions -09 and -14. It would have been a small matter of search-and-replace to go through and expand most of the acronyms.<br><br>2. Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>3. Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; references to ARP table in the context of asymmetric IRB is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logical view of a forwarding table that maintains an IP to MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; binding entry on a layer 3 interface for both IPv4 and IPv6.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These entries are not subject to ARP or ND protocol.<br>```<br><br>This passage shines a spotlight on the fact that “ARP table” as it’s used in this document is a misnomer, since it’s a table that is not (necessarily) populated by ARP. I don’t propose that you change the nomenclature, since it’s firmly established even though wrong — but it might be worth adding the first sentence or one like it to your Terminology section.<br><br>4. Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 depicts BT2 being present on the ingress PE, but the text makes it clear that in the symmetric mode that this figure depicts, BT2 doesn’t actually need to be there. Wouldn’t it be clearer if you didn’t show it?<br><br>5. Section 4<br><br>I have a hard time parsing this text:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each BT on a PE is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a unique VLAN (e.g., with a BD)<br>```<br><br>So, 1 VLAN —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where in turn it is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a single MAC-VRF<br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of VLAN-Based mode or a<br>&nbsp;  number of BTs can be associated with a single MAC-VRF in the case of<br>&nbsp;  VLAN-Aware Bundle mode.&nbsp; <br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>Since this is stated as an exception I guess that means you meant the preceding two (that I parsed as 1:many) are actually supposed to be 1:1? If so I think this needs a rewrite (it probably does regardless, for clarity). <br><br>6. Section 4.1<br><br>When you write “Internet standard bit order“, do you mean “network byte order“? Although even network byte order appears to be non-applicable, since the values are shown with an explicit byte order. <br><br>I realize the definitions are merely pasted from <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a> and that ship has sailed, but unless you can explain what “(in hex, in Internet standard bit-order)” is supposed to mean, I suggest removing it. (Alternately and less desirably, make it explicit that you’re providing a direct quotation of <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a>.)<br><br>7. Section 5.1<br><br>You say the Encapsulation Extended Community and Router’s MAC Extended Community have to be sent, but you say nothing about the required values. For Router's MAC, §8.1 specifies the required value, I suggest a forward reference to it. For Encapsulation, the closest I was able to find to a place where this is specified was section 9.1.1, but that's only an example. There really needs to be some place where it's spelled out. A bare minimum would be to cite <a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC 9012</a> §4.1, but that just provides the syntax -- you really should say something more about how to decide what value to send. For that matter, it could be what valueS to send -- is it legal for a NVE to advertise multiple Encapsulation Extended Communities? You don't say it isn't, and there are potential reasons to do so.<br><br>8. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using MAC-VRF Route Target (and Ethernet Tag if different from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zero), it identifies the corresponding MAC-VRF (and BT).&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC- VRF (and BT) exists (e.g., it is locally configured) then it<br>```<br><br>You use “e.g.” so I presume there might be other reasons the MAC-VRF and BT might exist even if not locally configured?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imports the MAC address into it.&nbsp; Otherwise, it does not import<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC address.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using IP-VRF route target, it identifies the corresponding IP-VRF<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and imports the IP address into it.<br>```<br><br>You don’t provide any conditional language in this bullet about “if the IP-VRF exists”. Why is that caveat required for MAC-VRF but not for IP-VRF?<br><br>9. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The inclusion of MPLS label2 field in this route signals to the<br>&nbsp;  receiving PE that this route is for symmetric IRB mode and MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 needs to be installed in forwarding path to identify the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding IP-VRF.<br>```<br><br>I was unable to make head nor tail of this paragraph. I suppose §5.4 is where the behavior is actually specified, so in a way it doesn’t matter (although maybe a forward reference would help). <br><br>10. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives this route with both the MAC-VRF and IP-<br>&nbsp;  VRF route targets and if the receiving PE does not support either<br>&nbsp;  asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then if it has the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  MAC-VRF, it only imports the MAC address.&nbsp; Otherwise, if it doesn't<br>&nbsp;  have the corresponding MAC-VRF, it must not import this route.<br>```<br><br>If it doesn’t support either asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then doesn’t that mean it doesn’t implement this specification at all? In that circumstance, how do you expect your “must not” to be respected?<br><br>11. Section 5.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If host B's (MAC, IP) has not yet been<br>&nbsp;  learnt either via a gratuitous ARP OR via a prior gleaning procedure,<br>&nbsp;  a new gleaning procedure MUST be triggered<br>```<br><br>Since you’ve used MUST here, you MUST provide a reference to where the “new gleaning procedure” is specified. <br><br>Also, has not been learnt by whom? The procedure must be triggered where?<br><br>12. Section 5.3<br><br>The second paragraph, that begins "Consider a subnet A", is tremendously confusing to a first-time reader (or at least to this first-time reader). I realize you probably think you're being helpful by providing a worked example, but as I read through it, it was the opposite of helpful. This is especially true because §5 and its subsections is about "Symmetric IRB Procedures" -- and the paragraph in question provides no procedures.<br><br>Some options to improve the situation --<br><br>- Remove the paragraph entirely.<br>- Preface the paragraph with "as an example to show why advertisement as RT-5 is required,"<br><br>13. Section 5.4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; global mode: VNI is set to the received label2 in the route which<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is domain-wide assigned.&nbsp; This VNI value from received label2 MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be the same as the locally configured VNI for the IP VRF as all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PEs in the NVO MUST be configured with the same IP VRF VNI for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this mode of operation.<br>```<br><br>What action is to be taken if this MUST is violated?<br><br>14. Section 6.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  For asymmetric IRB mode, Router's MAC EC is not needed because<br>```<br><br>Please either expand “EC” or add it to your definitions section. (Also applies to 5.1)<br><br>15. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If only MAC-VRF route target is used, then the receiving PE uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC-VRF route target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.e., many MAC-VRF route targets map to the same IP-VRF for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; given tenant.&nbsp; In this case, MAC-VRF may be used by the receiving<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PE to identify the corresponding IP VRF<br>```<br><br>Do you mean “in this case, the MAC-VRF *route target* may be used…”?<br><br>16.

Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>3. Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; references to ARP table in the context of asymmetric IRB is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logical view of a forwarding table that maintains an IP to MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; binding entry on a layer 3 interface for both IPv4 and IPv6.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These entries are not subject to ARP or ND protocol.<br>```<br><br>This passage shines a spotlight on the fact that “ARP table” as it’s used in this document is a misnomer, since it’s a table that is not (necessarily) populated by ARP. I don’t propose that you change the nomenclature, since it’s firmly established even though wrong — but it might be worth adding the first sentence or one like it to your Terminology section.<br><br>4. Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 depicts BT2 being present on the ingress PE, but the text makes it clear that in the symmetric mode that this figure depicts, BT2 doesn’t actually need to be there.

Section 5.1<br><br>You say the Encapsulation Extended Community and Router’s MAC Extended Community have to be sent, but you say nothing about the required values.

For Encapsulation, the closest I was able to find to a place where this is specified was section 9.1.1, but that's only an example. There really needs to be some place where it's spelled out. A bare minimum would be to cite <a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC 9012</a> §4.1, but that just provides the syntax -- you really should say something more about how to decide what value to send. For that matter, it could be what valueS to send -- is it legal for a NVE to advertise multiple Encapsulation Extended Communities? You don't say it isn't, and there are potential reasons to do so.<br><br>8.

I haven't chosen to make them blocking by including them in my DISCUSS; nonetheless I would appreciate replies to them.<br><br>1. I agree with the comments by several of the other reviewers, that there are just too many gratuitous acronyms in this document. They aren't the only thing that makes it hard to read, but they certainly contribute. I'm disappointed to see this hasn't been addressed between version -09 and -14. It would have been a small matter of search-and-replace to go through and expand most of the acronyms.<br>2. Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>3. Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; references to ARP table in the context of asymmetric IRB is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logical view of a forwarding table that maintains an IP to MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; binding entry on a layer 3 interface for both IPv4 and IPv6.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These entries are not subject to ARP or ND protocol.<br>```<br><br>This passage shines a spotlight on the fact that “ARP table” as it’s used in this document is a misnomer, since it’s a table that is not (necessarily) populated by ARP. I don’t propose that you change the nomenclature, since it’s firmly established even though wrong — but it might be worth adding the first sentence or one like it to your Terminology section.<br><br>4. Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 depicts BT2 being present on the ingress PE, but the text makes it clear that in the symmetric mode that this figure depicts, BT2 doesn’t actually need to be there. Wouldn’t it be clearer if you didn’t show it?<br><br>5. Section 4<br><br>I have a hard time parsing this text:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each BT on a PE is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a unique VLAN (e.g., with a BD)<br>```<br><br>So, 1 VLAN —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where in turn it is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a single MAC-VRF<br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of VLAN-Based mode or a<br>&nbsp;  number of BTs can be associated with a single MAC-VRF in the case of<br>&nbsp;  VLAN-Aware Bundle mode.&nbsp; <br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>Since this is stated as an exception I guess that means you meant the preceding two (that I parsed as 1:many) are actually supposed to be 1:1? If so I think this needs a rewrite (it probably does regardless, for clarity). <br><br>6. Section 4.1<br><br>When you write “Internet standard bit order“, do you mean “network byte order“? Although even network byte order appears to be non-applicable, since the values are shown with an explicit byte order. <br><br>I realize the definitions are merely pasted from <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a> and that ship has sailed, but unless you can explain what “(in hex, in Internet standard bit-order)” is supposed to mean, I suggest removing it. (Alternately and less desirably, make it explicit that you’re providing a direct quotation of <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a>.<br><br>7. Section 5.1<br><br>You say the Encapsulation Extended Community and Router’s MAC Extended Community have to be sent, but you say nothing about the required values. For Router's MAC, §8.1 specifies the required value, I suggest a forward reference to it. For Encapsulation, the closest I was able to find to a place where this is specified was section 9.1.1, but that's only an example. There really needs to be some place where it's spelled out. A bare minimum would be to cite <a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC 9012</a> §4.1, but that just provides the syntax -- you really should say something more about how to decide what value to send. For that matter, it could be what valueS to send -- is it legal for a NVE to advertise multiple Encapsulation Extended Communities? You don't say it isn't, and there are potential reasons to do so.<br><br>8. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using MAC-VRF Route Target (and Ethernet Tag if different from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zero), it identifies the corresponding MAC-VRF (and BT).&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC- VRF (and BT) exists (e.g., it is locally configured) then it<br>```<br><br>You use “e.g.” so I presume there might be other reasons the MAC-VRF and BT might exist even if not locally configured?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imports the MAC address into it.&nbsp; Otherwise, it does not import<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC address.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using IP-VRF route target, it identifies the corresponding IP-VRF<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and imports the IP address into it.<br>```<br><br>You don’t provide any conditional language in this bullet about “if the IP-VRF exists”. Why is that caveat required for MAC-VRF but not for IP-VRF?<br><br>9. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The inclusion of MPLS label2 field in this route signals to the<br>&nbsp;  receiving PE that this route is for symmetric IRB mode and MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 needs to be installed in forwarding path to identify the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding IP-VRF.<br>```<br><br>I was unable to make head nor tail of this paragraph. I suppose §5.4 is where the behavior is actually specified, so in a way it doesn’t matter (although maybe a forward reference would help). <br><br>10. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives this route with both the MAC-VRF and IP-<br>&nbsp;  VRF route targets and if the receiving PE does not support either<br>&nbsp;  asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then if it has the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  MAC-VRF, it only imports the MAC address.&nbsp; Otherwise, if it doesn't<br>&nbsp;  have the corresponding MAC-VRF, it must not import this route.<br>```<br><br>If it doesn’t support either asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then doesn’t that mean it doesn’t implement this specification at all? In that circumstance, how do you expect your “must not” to be respected?<br><br>11. Section 5.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If host B's (MAC, IP) has not yet been<br>&nbsp;  learnt either via a gratuitous ARP OR via a prior gleaning procedure,<br>&nbsp;  a new gleaning procedure MUST be triggered<br>```<br><br>Since you’ve used MUST here, you MUST provide a reference to where the “new gleaning procedure” is specified. <br><br>Also, has not been learnt by whom? The procedure must be triggered where?<br><br>12. Section 5.3<br><br>The second paragraph, that begins "Consider a subnet A", is tremendously confusing to a first-time reader (or at least to this first-time reader). I realize you probably think you're being helpful by providing a worked example, but as I read through it, it was the opposite of helpful. This is especially true because §5 and its subsections is about "Symmetric IRB Procedures" -- and the paragraph in question provides no procedures.<br><br>Some options to improve the situation --<br><br>- Remove the paragraph entirely.<br>- Preface the paragraph with "as an example to show why advertisement as RT-5 is required,"<br><br>13. Section 5.4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; global mode: VNI is set to the received label2 in the route which<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is domain-wide assigned.&nbsp; This VNI value from received label2 MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be the same as the locally configured VNI for the IP VRF as all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PEs in the NVO MUST be configured with the same IP VRF VNI for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this mode of operation.<br>```<br><br>What action is to be taken if this MUST is violated?<br><br>14. Section 6.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  For asymmetric IRB mode, Router's MAC EC is not needed because<br>```<br><br>Please either expand “EC” or add it to your definitions section. (Also applies to 5.1)<br><br>15. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If only MAC-VRF route target is used, then the receiving PE uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC-VRF route target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.e., many MAC-VRF route targets map to the same IP-VRF for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; given tenant.&nbsp; In this case, MAC-VRF may be used by the receiving<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PE to identify the corresponding IP VRF<br>```<br><br>Do you mean “in this case, the MAC-VRF *route target* may be used…”?<br><br>16. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives the MAC/IP Advertisement route with MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 field and it uses symmetric IRB mode<br>```<br><br>This entire section is entitled “asymmetric IRB procedures“. Why is there specification language regarding symmetric procedures in it? (I’m pretty sure this is not the only place this kind of problem appears.)<br><br>17. Section 7.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  On the source NVE, an age-out timer (for the silent host that has<br>&nbsp;  moved) is used to trigger an ARP probe.&nbsp; This age-out timer can be<br>&nbsp;  either ARP timer or MAC age-out timer and this is an implementation<br>&nbsp;  choice.&nbsp; The ARP request gets sent both locally to all the attached<br>&nbsp;  TSes on that subnet as well as it gets sent to all the remote NVEs<br>&nbsp;  (including the target NVE) participating in that subnet.&nbsp; The source<br>&nbsp;  NVE also withdraw the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route with only the<br>&nbsp;  MAC address (if it has previously advertised such a route).<br>```<br><br>Wouldn’t the source NVE only withdraw the route after a timeout had expired?

Section 2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R1: The solution must allow for both inter-subnet and intra-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic belonging to the same tenant to be locally routed and bridged<br>&nbsp;  respectively.&nbsp; The solution must provide IP routing for inter-subnet<br>&nbsp;  traffic and Ethernet Bridging for intra-subnet traffic.&nbsp; It should be<br>&nbsp;  noted that if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv6 and that NVE<br>&nbsp;  receives IPv4 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv4<br>&nbsp;  traffic is treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.&nbsp; Also vise versa,<br>&nbsp;  if an IP-VRF in a NVE is configured for IPv4 and that NVE receives<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 traffic on the corresponding VLAN, then the IPv6 traffic is<br>&nbsp;  treated as L2 traffic and it is bridged.<br><br>&nbsp;  R2: The solution must support bridging for non-IP traffic.<br>```<br><br>R1 is a little tortured, where you add all the caveats about “treated as L2 traffic”. Seems to me like it would fall out more naturally if you had simply introduced the concepts of routable and non-routable traffic, where routable traffic is that for which a suitable IP-VRF exists. That would also have the pleasant effect of making R2 say “… must support bridging for non-routable traffic” instead of “non-IP traffic”, which is technically incorrect (since per R1 you might have non-routable IP traffic). <br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  R3: The solution must allow inter-subnet switching to be disabled on<br>&nbsp;  a per VLAN basis on PEs where the traffic needs to be backhauled to<br>&nbsp;  another node (i.e., for performing FW or DPI functionality).<br>```<br><br>What’s “switching”? The document is about routing vs. bridging, which do you mean? I think you mean “routing”. IMO you should get rid of the word “switching” and replace with something less ambiguous, e.g. “routing”. (Both here and the one other place in the doc where you use “switching”.)<br><br>Also, I think you don’t mean “i.e.”, I think you mean “e.g.”. The meaning of “i.e.” is “in other words”. The meaning of “e.g.” is “for example”. The best way to avoid these problems, IMO, is to simply write out what you mean, so in this case write “(for example, for performing FW or DPI functionality).” (And oh by the way, you haven’t defined or expanded FW or DPI, please do so.)<br><br>2. Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; references to ARP table in the context of asymmetric IRB is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logical view of a forwarding table that maintains an IP to MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; binding entry on a layer 3 interface for both IPv4 and IPv6.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These entries are not subject to ARP or ND protocol.<br>```<br><br>This passage shines a spotlight on the fact that “ARP table” as it’s used in this document is a misnomer, since it’s a table that is not (necessarily) populated by ARP. I don’t propose that you change the nomenclature, since it’s firmly established even though wrong — but it might be worth adding the first sentence or one like it to your Terminology section.<br><br>3. Section 4<br><br>Figure 2 depicts BT2 being present on the ingress PE, but the text makes it clear that in the symmetric mode that this figure depicts, BT2 doesn’t actually need to be there. Wouldn’t it be clearer if you didn’t show it?<br><br>4. Section 4<br><br>I have a hard time parsing this text:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each BT on a PE is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a unique VLAN (e.g., with a BD)<br>```<br><br>So, 1 VLAN —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where in turn it is<br>&nbsp;  associated with a single MAC-VRF<br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of VLAN-Based mode or a<br>&nbsp;  number of BTs can be associated with a single MAC-VRF in the case of<br>&nbsp;  VLAN-Aware Bundle mode.&nbsp; <br>```<br><br>So, 1 MAC-VRF —&gt; at least 1 BT (1:many)<br><br>Since this is stated as an exception I guess that means you meant the preceding two (that I parsed as 1:many) are actually supposed to be 1:1? If so I think this needs a rewrite (it probably does regardless, for clarity). <br><br>5. Section 4.1<br><br>When you write “Internet standard bit order“, do you mean “network byte order“? Although even network byte order appears to be non-applicable, since the values are shown with an explicit byte order. <br><br>I realize the definitions are merely pasted from <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a> and that ship has sailed, but unless you can explain what “(in hex, in Internet standard bit-order)” is supposed to mean, I suggest removing it. (Alternately and less desirably, make it explicit that you’re providing a direct quotation of <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a>.)<br><br>6. Section 5.1<br><br>You say the Encapsulation Extended Community and Router’s MAC Extended Community have to be sent, but you say nothing about the required values. For Router's MAC, §8.1 specifies the required value, I suggest a forward reference to it. For Encapsulation, the closest I was able to find to a place where this is specified was section 9.1.1, but that's only an example. There really needs to be some place where it's spelled out. A bare minimum would be to cite <a href="/doc/rfc9012/">RFC 9012</a> §4.1, but that just provides the syntax -- you really should say something more about how to decide what value to send. For that matter, it could be what valueS to send -- is it legal for a NVE to advertise multiple Encapsulation Extended Communities? You don't say it isn't, and there are potential reasons to do so.<br><br>7. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using MAC-VRF Route Target (and Ethernet Tag if different from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zero), it identifies the corresponding MAC-VRF (and BT).&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAC- VRF (and BT) exists (e.g., it is locally configured) then it<br>```<br><br>You use “e.g.” so I presume there might be other reasons the MAC-VRF and BT might exist even if not locally configured?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; imports the MAC address into it.&nbsp; Otherwise, it does not import<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC address.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Using IP-VRF route target, it identifies the corresponding IP-VRF<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and imports the IP address into it.<br>```<br><br>You don’t provide any conditional language in this bullet about “if the IP-VRF exists”. Why is that caveat required for MAC-VRF but not for IP-VRF?<br><br>8. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The inclusion of MPLS label2 field in this route signals to the<br>&nbsp;  receiving PE that this route is for symmetric IRB mode and MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 needs to be installed in forwarding path to identify the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding IP-VRF.<br>```<br><br>I was unable to make head nor tail of this paragraph. I suppose §5.4 is where the behavior is actually specified, so in a way it doesn’t matter (although maybe a forward reference would help). <br><br>9. Section 5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives this route with both the MAC-VRF and IP-<br>&nbsp;  VRF route targets and if the receiving PE does not support either<br>&nbsp;  asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then if it has the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  MAC-VRF, it only imports the MAC address.&nbsp; Otherwise, if it doesn't<br>&nbsp;  have the corresponding MAC-VRF, it must not import this route.<br>```<br><br>If it doesn’t support either asymmetric or symmetric IRB modes, then doesn’t that mean it doesn’t implement this specification at all? In that circumstance, how do you expect your “must not” to be respected?<br><br>10. Section 5.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If host B's (MAC, IP) has not yet been<br>&nbsp;  learnt either via a gratuitous ARP OR via a prior gleaning procedure,<br>&nbsp;  a new gleaning procedure MUST be triggered<br>```<br><br>Since you’ve used MUST here, you MUST provide a reference to where the “new gleaning procedure” is specified. <br><br>Also, has not been learnt by whom? The procedure must be triggered where?<br><br>11. Section 5.3<br><br>The second paragraph, that begins "Consider a subnet A", is tremendously confusing to a first-time reader (or at least to this first-time reader). I realize you probably think you're being helpful by providing a worked example, but as I read through it, it was the opposite of helpful. This is especially true because §5 and its subsections is about "Symmetric IRB Procedures" -- and the paragraph in question provides no procedures.<br><br>Some options to improve the situation --<br><br>- Remove the paragraph entirely.<br>- Preface the paragraph with "as an example to show why advertisement as RT-5 is required,"<br><br>12. Section 5.4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; global mode: VNI is set to the received label2 in the route which<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is domain-wide assigned.&nbsp; This VNI value from received label2 MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be the same as the locally configured VNI for the IP VRF as all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PEs in the NVO MUST be configured with the same IP VRF VNI for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this mode of operation.<br>```<br><br>What action is to be taken if this MUST is violated?<br><br>13. Section 6.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  For asymmetric IRB mode, Router's MAC EC is not needed because<br>```<br><br>Please either expand “EC” or add it to your definitions section. (Also applies to 5.1)<br><br>14. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If only MAC-VRF route target is used, then the receiving PE uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the MAC-VRF route target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.e., many MAC-VRF route targets map to the same IP-VRF for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; given tenant.&nbsp; In this case, MAC-VRF may be used by the receiving<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PE to identify the corresponding IP VRF<br>```<br><br>Do you mean “in this case, the MAC-VRF *route target* may be used…”?<br><br>15. Section 6.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  If the receiving PE receives the MAC/IP Advertisement route with MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 field and it uses symmetric IRB mode<br>```<br><br>This entire section is entitled “asymmetric IRB procedures“. Why is there specification language regarding symmetric procedures in it? (I’m pretty sure this is not the only place this kind of problem appears.)<br><br>16. Section 7.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  On the source NVE, an age-out timer (for the silent host that has<br>&nbsp;  moved) is used to trigger an ARP probe.&nbsp; This age-out timer can be<br>&nbsp;  either ARP timer or MAC age-out timer and this is an implementation<br>&nbsp;  choice.&nbsp; The ARP request gets sent both locally to all the attached<br>&nbsp;  TSes on that subnet as well as it gets sent to all the remote NVEs<br>&nbsp;  (including the target NVE) participating in that subnet.&nbsp; The source<br>&nbsp;  NVE also withdraw the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route with only the<br>&nbsp;  MAC address (if it has previously advertised such a route).<br>```<br><br>Wouldn’t the source NVE only withdraw the route after a timeout had expired? As you have written this paragraph, in case the silent TS has not moved, the following would happen:<br><br>```<br>Time t: age-out timer fires, ARP probe is sent<br>Time t: NVE withdraws route advertisement<br>Time u &gt; t: TS receives ARP probe, sends ARP reply<br>Time v &gt; u: NVE receives ARP reply<br>Time v: NVE re-advertises route<br>```<br><br>Presumably this churn isn’t intended. <br><br>18. Section 9.2<br><br>How does the NVE learn what subnets are behind its attached TS? <br><br>19. Section 9.2<br><br>What about if TS4 wants to reach SN1? How does it know where to send the packet? (I suppose the answer may be the same as for #18.)</div></td>

This<br>places an obligation on the tunnel endpoints to properly isolate and<br>process such "internal" tunnel traffic without hampering the ability of<br>tenans systems to communicate.&nbsp; In a world where tenant systems can<br>appear at any time, using previously unknown MAC addresses, this<br>represents a rather challenging problem: how will the PEs be able to<br>pick (and avertise) MAC addresses that they know will not conflict with<br>any present or future customer systems?&nbsp; (A similar dilemma led to quite<br>a delay in the processing of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bfd-vxlan/">draft-ietf-bfd-vxlan</a>, which in that case<br>was resolved by limiting the BFD operation to just the "management VNI"<br>which is not subject to MAC address conflict with customer systems.)&nbsp; In<br>this docuement's case, we seem to be using a "well-known"/reserved MAC<br>address range from <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a>; in principle, this should be enough to<br>avoid conflicts, if customer systems are known to not squat on this<br>reserved range.&nbsp; However, this document has some text in Section 4.1<br>that indicates that there must be external knowledge that auto-derived<br>MAC addresses in the <a href="/doc/rfc5798/">RFC 5798</a> ranges "[do] not collide with any customer<br>MAC address".&nbsp; So I'm left uncertain whether or not this potential<br>problem is addressed or not.&nbsp; (Also, I don't know if the limit on 255<br>distinct such MAC addresses presents a scaling issue.)<br><br>Also, is there any risk that the EVPN IRB setup might also want to use<br>VRRPv3, and thus collide on the MAC addresses in a different manner?<br><br>(1.1) I'm less sure whether there's a similar collision risk for IP<br>addresses -- we assign IP addresses to NVEs (e.g., for use as BGP Next<br>Hop addresses) and these are used as VTEP addresses when encapsulating<br>packets that are going inter-subnet.&nbsp; I think that at this point in the<br>packet processing we may already know that we're in the the "IRB tunnel"<br>scope and that may be enough to de-conflict any potential IP address<br>collision between NVE and customer addresses.<br><br>(2) Section 7 appears to reference (in a normative fashion)<br>[IRB-EXT-MOBILITY] but there is no such reference.<br>Similarly (as Murray notes), there are a couple apparent references to<br>[TUNNEL-ENCAP] that are also arguably normative, but the target of the<br>reference is not forthcoming (and the IANA registry does not show a "BGP<br>Encapsulation Extended Community" that is supposedly defined by<br>[TUNNEL-ENCAP]).<br><br>There is also not a listed reference for [EVPN-PREFIX], though one could<br>perhaps surmise that it is intended to be<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement/">I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement</a>] (given that the latter does<br>allocate EVPN route type 5 for carrying IP Prefix routes, etx.).<br>However, given that this document has text like "MUST advertise local<br>subnet routes as RT-5", this needs to be a normative (not informative)<br>reference.&nbsp; (We may also want to explicitly reference [EVPN-PREFIX]<br>where those normative requirements are made.)<br><br>(3) I'm not sure whether we are modifying the error-handling semantics<br>for RT-2 from what is specified in <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC 7432</a> (and, furthermore, whether<br>the changes are backwards-compatible).&nbsp;

 It is worth noting that if the applications that are running on the<br>&nbsp;  TSes are employing or relying on any form of MAC security, then<br>&nbsp;  either the first model (i.e. using anycast MAC address) should be<br>&nbsp;

 Although both of these options are equally applicable to both<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  the VLANs for that tenant.&nbsp; Furthermore, it simplifies the operation<br>&nbsp;  as there is no need for Default Gateway extended community<br>&nbsp;  advertisement and its associated MAC aliasing procedure.&nbsp; Yet another<br>&nbsp;  advantage is that following host mobility, the host does not need to<br>&nbsp;  refresh the default GW ARP/ND entry.<br><br>We're really promoting option-1 here, almost to the extent that we<br>should ask if option-2 needs to be mentioned at all.&nbsp; The only benefit I<br>can think of so far is that for option-1 you have to share MACsec keys<br>all over the place, which option-2 avoids (to be fair, this is a<br>significant advantage in some cases);

(It also seems like this risk of<br>collision would hold however the PE MAC addresses are selected?)<br><br>&nbsp;  Irrespective of using only the anycast address or both anycast and<br>&nbsp;  non-anycast addresses on the same IRB, when a TS sends an ARP request<br>&nbsp;  or ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) to the PE that is attached to, the<br>&nbsp;  request is sent for the anycast IP address of the IRB interface<br>&nbsp;  associated with the TS's subnet and the reply will use anycast MAC<br>&nbsp;  address (in both Source MAC in the Ethernet header and Sender<br>&nbsp;  hardware address in the payload).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit(?): I don't really see how the declarative "the [ARP or NS] request<br>is sent for the anycast IP address can place such a restriction on the<br>TS behavior;

 instance, PEs MUST advertise local subnet routes as RT-5.&nbsp; These<br><br>nit: "where all subnets are not provisioned at all PEs participating"<br>has a slightly different meaning than "where not all subnets are<br>provisioned at all PEs participating".&nbsp; I suspect the latter is what's<br>intended, though I am not 100% sure.<br><br>&nbsp;  Consider a subnet A that is locally attached to PE1 and subnet B that<br>&nbsp;  is locally attached to PE2 and to PE3.&nbsp; Host A in subnet A, that is<br>&nbsp;  attached to PE1 initiates a data packet destined to host B in subnet<br>&nbsp;  B that is attached to PE3.&nbsp; If host B's (MAC, IP) has not yet been<br><br>Could we perhaps use different names/symbols for subnets and hosts<br>within them?<br><br>&nbsp;  subnet B locally attached.&nbsp; Once the packet is received at PE2 OR<br>&nbsp;  PE3, and the route lookup yields a glean result, an ARP request is<br>&nbsp;  triggered and flooded across the layer-2 overlay.&nbsp; This ARP request<br>&nbsp;  would be received and replied to by host B, resulting in host B (MAC,<br>&nbsp;  IP) learning at PE3, and its advertisement across the EVPN network.<br><br>(side note) When I first read this, the "layer-2 overlay" (vs. "layer-3<br>overlay") confused me, but I think I figured it out.&nbsp; To check: the ARP<br>request on the layer-2 overlay is needed in order to cover all of subnet<br>B (and thus, to meet the criterion that the packet from PE1 has to be<br>able to be processed whether it arrives at PE2 or PE3).&nbsp; The ARP request<br>triggers the PE to which host B is attached in order to advertise the<br>EVPN route over BGP, so that PE1 learns about host B's (MAC, IP) and can<br>send directly to PE3 in the future.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;

 If the receiving PE receives the MAC/IP Advertisement route with MPLS<br>&nbsp;  label2 field and it can support symmetric IRB mode, then it should<br>&nbsp;  use the MAC-VRF route target to identify its corresponding MAC-VRF<br>&nbsp;  table and import the MAC address.&nbsp; It should use the IP-VRF route<br>&nbsp;  target to identify the corresponding IP-VRF table and import the IP<br>&nbsp;  address, as specified in symmetric IRB handling.&nbsp; It MUST NOT import<br>&nbsp;  (IP, MAC) association into its ARP table.<br><br>I don't think I understand why this is a MUST NOT, especially since we<br>do store the (IP, MAC) association in the ARP table in the previous<br>paragraph's case.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>The mobility procedures in Section 15 of <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC 7432</a> on paper don't have<br>very great security properties -- at any remote signal indicating a<br>mobility event for a given MAC address, a PE advertising reachability to<br>that MAC will withdraw the route.&nbsp; (Though, this is probably something<br>of a "the entire system is trusted" effect.)&nbsp; Perhaps local learning<br>would cause it to be reintrodced if the MAC in question had not actually<br>moved away, but there seems to be some risk of flapping and triggering<br>the MAC Duplication detection.&nbsp; The concrete advice we give in Section<br>7.1 to send a local ARP probe is good, but how rigid does the sequencing<br>need to be amongst (receive EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement, send local ARP<br>probe/wait for response, and withdraw EVPN Mac/IP Advertisement)?&nbsp;

" is obviously never the case for IPv6. I understand that the rest of the paragraph explains how to handle the case but it could be easier to treat IPv6 in a separate sentence.<br><br>-- Section 7.1 --<br>While about mobility, this section appears to be also applicable to Duplicate Address Detection but is unclear on what to do when the same IP but different MAC (i.e., an actual IP address collision). Or is it covered in other documents?<br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>"BD and subnet are equivalent terms" while in the rest of the document "IP subnet" is often used. If "subnet IP" and "subnet" are synonyms, then I suggest to keep using one for consistency or at least mention that "IP subnet" and "subnet" are the same concept (or explain the difference if they are not identical).</div></td>
