If the latter was intended, then some rewording<br>may be beneficial, such as:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IAB carries out a number of activities that impact IANA protocol <br>&nbsp;  parameter registries.&nbsp; The following principles guide how the IAB<br>&nbsp;  carries out these activities.&nbsp; These principles must be taken <br>&nbsp;  together; their order is not significant.<br><br>However, the later use of the first person plural is then very <br>ambiguous.

The next "IETF Response:" line isn't indented as much, and if this line was indented the same way, I'd definitely read the paragraph as part of the IETF Response.<br><br>FOR THE IESG, no author response required: You have to love this description of <a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP9</a> ...<br><br>&nbsp;  The Internet Standards Process is documented in [<a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a>].&nbsp; That<br>&nbsp;  document explains not only how standards are developed, but also how<br>&nbsp;  disputes about decisions are resolved.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> has been amended a<br>&nbsp;  number of times, and those amendments are indicated in [RFC-INDEX].<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Is this the best we can ask authors to do in a document that is going to people who don't read RFCs for a living? I'm afraid the answer from the IESG may be "yes" ...<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is important to note that the IETF includes anyone who wishes to<br>&nbsp;  participate.&nbsp; Staff and participants from ICANN or the Regional<br>&nbsp;  Internet Registries (RIRs) regularly participate in IETF activities.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I was somewhat confused about whether this is about who the IETF allows to participate, or about the definition of the "the IETF". Given that you're trying to describe who's included in non-member organization, perhaps this could be something like:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is important to note that the IETF does not have formal membership.<br>&nbsp;  The term "the IETF" includes anyone who wishes to participate in the IETF,<br>&nbsp;  and IETF participants may also be members of other communities.&nbsp; Staff and<br>&nbsp;  participants from ICANN or the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) <br>&nbsp;  regularly participate in IETF activities.<br>&nbsp;  <br>IN this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The routing architecture has evolved over time, and is expected to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; continue to do so.&nbsp; Such evolution may have an impact on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate IP address allocation strategies.&nbsp; As and when that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; happens, we will consult with the RIR community, as we have done<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the past.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>"As and when" reads roughly to me. Perhaps "As", or perhaps "If and when"?<br><br>FOR THE IESG: In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IAB members are selected and may be recalled through a Nominating<br>&nbsp;  Committee (NOMCOM) process, which is described in [<a href="/doc/rfc3777/">RFC3777</a>]. <br>&nbsp;  <br>The use of one RFC as shorthand for a multi-RFC BCP in this case is problematic, and this text doesn't even give the hand-waving "by the way, that RFC has been updated, and you can probably find the updates in the RFC-INDEX" that previous instances included.<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IAB provides oversight of the protocol parameters registries of<br>&nbsp;  the IETF, and is responsible for selecting appropriate operator(s)<br>&nbsp;  and related per-registry arrangements.&nbsp; Especially when relationships<br>&nbsp;  among protocols call for it, many registries are operated by, or in<br>&nbsp;  conjunction with, other bodies.&nbsp; Unless the IAB or IETF has concluded<br>&nbsp;  that special treatment is needed, the operator for registries is<br>&nbsp;  currently ICANN.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't think the last sentence is right. Is it correct to say "ICANN is currently the operator for all registries, except for specific registries where the IAB or IETF has concluded that special treatment is needed"? The current text reads like ICANN as the operator is all or nothing.<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  We think the structures that sustain the protocol parameters<br>&nbsp;  registries function need to be strong enough that they can be offered<br>&nbsp;  independently by the Internet technical community, without the need<br>&nbsp;  for backing from external parties.&nbsp; And we believe we largely are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  there already, although the system can be strengthened further, and<br>&nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  continuous improvements are being made.<br>&nbsp;  <br>The indicated phrase seems very breezy. Perhaps "And we believe those structures are strong enough now"?<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; V.&nbsp; NTIA Requirements<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, NTIA has established that the transition proposal<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; must meet the following five requirements:<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; "Support and enhance the multistakeholder model;"<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>&nbsp;  IETF Response:<br><br>&nbsp;  Everyone is welcome to participate in IETF activities.&nbsp; The policies<br>&nbsp;  and procedures are outlined in the documents we named above.&nbsp; In-<br>&nbsp;  person attendance is not required for participation, and many people<br>&nbsp;  participate in email discussions that have never attended an IETF<br>&nbsp;  meeting.&nbsp; An email account is the only requirement to participate.<br>&nbsp;  The IETF makes use of both formal and informal lines of communication<br>&nbsp;  to collaborate with other organizations within the multistakeholder<br>&nbsp;  ecosystem.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Is it worth explicitly pointing out that there is no cost of membership?<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  This proposal maintains the existing open framework that allows<br>&nbsp;  anyone to participate in the development of IETF standards, including<br>&nbsp;  the IANA protocol parameters registries policies.&nbsp; Further, an<br>&nbsp;  implementer anywhere in the world has full access to the protocol<br>&nbsp;  specification published in the RFC series and the protocol parameters<br>&nbsp;  registries published at <a href="http://iana.org">iana.org</a>.&nbsp; Those who require assignments in<br>&nbsp;  the IANA protocol registries will continue to be able to do so, as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  specified by the existing policies for those registries.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't think that parses. Is this "will continue to be able to request these assignments"?<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  IETF Response:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IESG established the IANAPLAN working group to develop this<br>&nbsp;  response.&nbsp; Anyone was welcome to join the discussion and participate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  in the development of this response.&nbsp; An open mailing list<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="mailto:ianaplan@ietf.org">ianaplan@ietf.org</a>) was associated with the working group.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  addition, IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the broader<br>&nbsp;  community, and all input is welcome.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I wonder if this text reflects how open the IETF is. It would be correct to say "Anyone on earth with access to e-mail was able to join ...". That might not be the right thing to say, but is the current text strong enough?<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  Announcement of a public session on the transition:&nbsp; http://<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg13028.html">www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg13028.html</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>I'm not sure "public" is the right adjective. Perhaps something like "Announcement of a face-to-face session with provision for interactive remote participation? I'm asking because the URL just says there's a session at IETF 90, and that would make a random reader of this document think travel, accommodations and meeting fees would be required.<br><br>I think discussion about the IAB Note is headed the right direction, but that matters.</div></td>

I think it would sound more professional to use the full mission statement from 3935 instead of the goal statement:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IETF is a global organization that produces voluntary standards,<br>&nbsp;  whose mission is to produce high quality, relevant technical and<br>&nbsp;  engineering documents that influence the way people design, use, and<br>&nbsp;  manage the Internet in such a way as to make the Internet work<br>&nbsp;  better [<a href="/doc/rfc3595/">RFC3595</a>].<br><br>Maybe too much of a mouthful, but I think it sounds better. Entirely up to the WG.<br><br>Also in section 2:<br><br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; VI.&nbsp; Community Process<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; This section should describe the process your community used for<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; developing this proposal, including:<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt; o The steps that were taken to develop the proposal and to<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;  determine consensus.<br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>&nbsp;  IETF Response:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IESG established the IANAPLAN working group to develop this<br>&nbsp;  response.&nbsp; Anyone was welcome to join the discussion and participate<br>&nbsp;  in the development of this response.&nbsp; An open mailing list<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="mailto:ianaplan@ietf.org">ianaplan@ietf.org</a>) was associated with the working group.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  addition, IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the broader<br>&nbsp;  community, and all input is welcome.<br>&nbsp;  <br>The simple editorial point is that everything else is in the past tense except for the the last sentence, which switches from present perfect to present. Present perfect seems right for everything except the first sentence. The other point about this is that it doesn't quite answer the question about the steps taken to determine consensus. Here's a suggested replacement; the stuff in curly braces is if the group thinks it's worth being more explicit:<br><br>&nbsp;  IETF Response:<br><br>&nbsp;  The IESG established the IANAPLAN working group to develop this<br>&nbsp;  response.&nbsp; Anyone has been welcome to join the discussion and<br>&nbsp;  participate in the development of this response.&nbsp; An open mailing<br>&nbsp;  list (<a href="mailto:ianaplan@ietf.org">ianaplan@ietf.org</a>) has been associated with the working group.<br>&nbsp;  In addition, IETF's IANA practices have been discussed in the broader<br>&nbsp;  community, and all input has been welcome. Normal IETF procedures <br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a>] [<a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a>] were used to determine rough consensus{: The<br>&nbsp;  chairs of the working group reviewed open issues and, after an<br>&nbsp;  internal working group last call, determined that all had been<br>&nbsp;  satisfactorily addressed, and subsequently the IESG did a formal<br>&nbsp;  IETF-wide Last Call followed by a formal review and determined that<br>&nbsp;  the document had rough consensus}.<br><br>Finally, one last editorial bit: When providing the links to announcements, I suggest using the <a href="http://mailarchive.ietf.org">mailarchive.ietf.org</a> ones instead of the mailman ones (which appear in the "Archived-at:" of each message). The <a href="http://mailarchive.ietf.org">mailarchive.ietf.org</a> links I believe are intended to be the place to find mail over the long term.</div></td>

The WG<br>did not agree to this suggestion, and reached rough consensus not to<br>include such statements in output from the WG. In addition, a member<br>of the IAOC pointed out that it would be hard for the IAOC to<br>implement instructions that did not have a fallback position (what to<br>do in case negotiation failed). The WG's charter explicitly required<br>the WG not to constrain the IAB's or IAOC's execution of their<br>respective duties too much, so it is difficult to know how the WG<br>could have produced something incorporating this suggestion, even if<br>it had wanted to.<br><br>Two participants were sufficiently unhappy with the resulting draft,<br>apparently in part because of the previous two decisions, that they<br>requested their names be removed from the Acknowledgements section,<br>despite their contributions to the discussion of the draft.<br><br>3.&nbsp; Intellectual Property<br><br>Each author has confirmed conformance with <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>/79.
