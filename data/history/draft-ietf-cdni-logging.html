I assume these are not intentional, and it's entirely possible I have misread some things. But I would like to make sure they are considered prior to progressing.<br><br>- 3.4.1, c-groupid: The privacy-related guidance about c-groupids indentifying individual clients (in the several bullet list entries with "-" bullets) seems contingent on the MAY in the parent (with the "+" bullet.) The parent says that you MAY structure the field so that parts identify the aggregate and one part aggregates the individual, with the sub-bullets following an "In this case..." clause. I assume the guidance is intended to apply even when an implementation doesn't structure c-groupid that way (or at all.) <br><br>- 7.1: This section seems to effectively say that various protections are required when they are required. But it doesn't give advice on when they may be required. (For example, when c-groupid can be mapped to individual client addresses.)<br><br>- 7.3: "Making detailed CDNI logging<br>&nbsp;  information known to the uCDN does not represent a particular privacy<br>&nbsp;  concern because the uCDN is already exposed at request redirection<br>&nbsp;  time to most of the information that shows up as CDNI logging<br>&nbsp;  information (e.g., enduser IP@, URL, HTTP headers - at least when<br>&nbsp;  HTTP redirection is used between uCDN and dCDN)."<br><br>I agree this is mostly true for HTTP redirection. But as you mention, the assertion seems to fall down for DNS redirection, where the uCDN may have considerably less information. I think some different guidance for that case may be needed.<br><br>-- "Transporting<br>&nbsp;  detailed CDNI logging information over the HTTP based CDNI Logging<br>&nbsp;  Interface does not represent a particular privacy concern because it<br>&nbsp;  is protected by usual IETF privacy-protection mechanism (e.g.,TLS)."<br><br>I don't find normative text that says privacy-sensitive information MUST be protected. Just that information that needs to be protected MUST be protected. The reader is left to infer that privacy-sensitive information is covered by that. (See previous comment about 7.1). Without something explicit there, I think it highly likely that some people will rationalize that their deployments don't need protection for one reason or another.</div></td>

It was originally up for IESG review when I was on leave, so I was not able to review it at that time. The document needs one more ballot to progress, so I told Spencer I would review it. I realize it's probably frustrating to see another DISCUSS at this point but these should be straightforward to resolve I think.<br><br>(1)<br>I am wondering about a potential inconsistency that I see in Section 3.4.1. I see with the definition of the c-groupid field that there is inherent support for reporting about clients as aggregates, which is great, and even when reporting is done about individual clients there are a bunch of normative recommendations to try to reduce the chances that a logging field will be tied back to an individual user or host. Excellent. But then with the definition of the cs(insert_HTTP_header_name_here) field and discussion about it, there is no equivalent normative guidance given about not including headers that could potentially be used to identify an individual user or host. There is discussion about cookies but none of it is normative, and cookies are not the only headers that could be identifying. In fact, one of the examples given -- User-Agent -- is known to be identifying in some cases.<br><br>Given the extent to which the specification of c-groupid goes to support masking the identity of the host, I would expect normative guidance about the use of the header field. That is, if an implementation is using c-groupid to represent an aggregate, it would make sense to me that it MUST NOT include header fields that could be uniquely identifying. I also wonder if the recommendations about cookies in 3.4.1 could be made normative. I will say that based on the use cases for these logs listed in 2.2.5 it's hard to understand what a uCDN needs headers like cookies for on a consistent basis; if they're needed for an occasional troubleshoot, logging them consistently seems like overkill.<br><br>(2)<br>Section 7.1 says:<br><br>"In an environment where any such protection is required, mutually<br>&nbsp;  authenticated encrypted transport MUST be used to ensure<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality of the logging information.&nbsp; To that end, TLS MUST be<br>&nbsp;  used (including authentication of the remote end) by the server-side<br>&nbsp;  and the client-side of the CDNI Logging feed, as well as the server-<br>&nbsp;  side and the client-side of the CDNI Logging File pull mechanism."<br><br>I know this text has been the subject of much discussion and careful editing, and that I raised an issue on this on the redirection draft. What I don't understand from reading this is whether the expectation is that all servers and clients implementing this specification will use TLS. The first sentence seems to indicate that there will be cases when that is not true. The second sentence says MUST use, which means use in every case. Which is it?</div></td>

This would allow a uCDN to calculate the "terminal type" KPI listed in 2.2.5.5.2 without requiring full, potentially identifying User-Agent strings to be logged.<br><br>(2) I think the use of partial-time in 3.4.1 means that the timestamps have no time zone information. It's not clear to me how the uCDN uses these timestamps in an absolute sense anyway, but I'm wondering if that could create problems if the uCDN does not know what time zone the dCDN is in. The time information in that case is somewhat meaningless if the uCDN needs to know the actual time at which something occurred.</div></td>

However, it is our job to provide<br>an API that encourages and effectively supports behaving well<br>in relation to privacy. So, that said...<br><br>(1) 2.2.5.5: there's no interoperability need for this<br>section, and even if there are data retention requirements to<br>be met, I don't see how the logging API is relevant to that.<br>For example, a dCDN would not have it's data retention<br>requirements met by a uCDN I think. I think just deleting<br>this is the right action.<br><br>(2) 3.3: MD5 is no longer good enough for data integrity and<br>128 bits in 32 ascii-hex is too short for SHA-256, which ought<br>be the MUST alg here. (Some variable length is needed or else<br>put the algorithm name in the field name.)<br><br>(3) c-ip-anonymizing: guidance is needed that IPv4 and IPv6<br>aren't the same here. Why isn't the same idea done for c-port<br>and other fields?&nbsp; Has there been any analysis of the<br>effectiveness of this scheme in not allowing identification or<br>re-identification? If not, isn't that really needed if we are<br>serious about defining an API that can protect privacy? If<br>that was discussed on the list, please send some pointers so I<br>can get familiar with the work during the discussion.&nbsp; <br><br>(4) Why is c-ip MTI but the (hopefully) privacy friendly<br>variant is not?<br><br>(5) I'm not clear why you need to be able to send HTTP header<br>values or session IDs via this i/f. Why is that needed? (And<br>it seems very dangerous, e.g. "cs(COOKIE)" could be a doosy.)<br><br>(6) Just checking - given relevations of snooping, why not say<br>"MUST use TLS with mutual-auth"? In particular if we don't end<br>up with a usefully privacy-friendly version of this, where is<br>the safe-but-cleartext use-case described that justifies the<br>current SHOULD?</div></td>

I'm not convinced it's complete and correct. I am certainly willing to be talked out of my concern, but I think this could use a massive edit by someone who knows ABNF, as well as a discussion about intended contents. Details:<br><br>3.1: I always prefer to import the rules you are using simply by reference rather than of copying them. Prevents silly errors.<br><br>On these, let's see if you really mean what you say you mean:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMEFORMAT = ALPHANUM *(ALPHANUM / "_" / "-")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>So, are you really OK with a NAMEFORMAT of "1---___---"? Often what people really want is:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NAMEFORMAT = ALPHANUM *(["_" / "-"] ALPHANUM)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Is that what you want?<br><br>On the next bit:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; QSTRING = DQUOTE *NDQUOTE DQUOTE ; where<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NDQUOTE =&nbsp; / 2DQUOTE ; whereby a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  DQUOTE is conveyed inside a QSTRING unambiguously by repeating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NHTABSTRING = *NHTAB ; where<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NHTAB = <br><br>(By way of formatting, outdent NDQUOTE and NHTAB, and get rid of "; where".)<br><br>When you say , is that what you really mean? You want to allow control characters? Seems to me that that is going to introduce a whole new set of security considerations. Also, the fact that you call these things xSTRING sends up a flag for me that you maybe want them to be textual. Are you allowing for things outside of US-ASCII? Section 3.2 seems to say only US-ASCII. Finally, do you really want NDQUOTE to allow for CR, LF, and HTAB? That means that parsers have to be a bit smarter, and the line in 3.2 that says, "Each line ... MUST contain either a directive of a CDNI Logging Record", and the line in 3.4 that says, "CDNI Logging Fields MUST be separated by the HTAB character", both seem bogus. So, assuming you want only US-ASCII and that you don't want CR LF or HTAB in any of these, these should be:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; QSTRING = DQUOTE *NDQUOTE DQUOTE<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NDQUOTE = SP / %x21 / %x23-7E / (DQUOTE DQUOTE)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; DQUOTE is conveyed inside a QSTRING unambiguously by repeating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NHTABSTRING = *NHTAB<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NHTAB = SP / VCHAR<br><br>or if you like, simply:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NHTABSTRING = *( SP / VCHAR )<br><br>If you want non-US-ASCII, I'd include UTF-8 and call that out. I can tell you how to do that, but I hope you're not doing that.<br><br>If you want CR and LF in both QSTRING and NHTABSTRING, and HTAB in QSTRING, you need to fix the lines in 3.2 and 3.4. If don't want them, you're going to have to describe how to unfold and de-tab the HTTP header field values somewhere.<br><br>3.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RECLINE =&nbsp; CRLF<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RECGROUP = *RECLINE<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = 1*<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>These seem kind of a cop-out. Seems like you could easily define RECLINE as:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RECLINE&nbsp; &nbsp; = date HTAB time HTAB time-taken HTAB ...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = DATE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = TIME<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time-taken = DEC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [...]<br><br>The last line is nowhere near legitimate ABNF. How about just defining a proper LOGFILE as:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  LOGFILE&nbsp; &nbsp; = 1*(DIRGROUP RECGROUP)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>If you're going to bother with ABNF, use ABNF. The explanations can still appear in 3.3 and 3.4.1.<br><br>3.3: The top-level ABNF for DIRNAME and DIRVAL give the implementer no help with regard to what is legitimate syntax. You mention the syntax for DIRNAME in 6.1, but that's not where it belongs. At least you should put in:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  DIRNAME = NAMEFORMAT<br><br>For DIRVAL, you should probably have at least the most general format of:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  DIRVAL = NHTABSTRING / QSTRING<br><br>and then give specifics below. But you could also change 3.2 and say something like:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DIRGROUP = version<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  uuid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [claimed-orig]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [established-orig]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1*record-type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1*fields<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [integrity-hash]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *new-dir<br><br>Then in 3.3, you could define:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; version&nbsp;  = "Version:" HTAB "CDNI" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uuid&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = "UUID:" HTAB NHTABSTRING<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new-dir&nbsp;  = <br><br>and indicate that unknown directives must be ignored, or something like that.<br><br>This is wrong:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Fields:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; format: FIENAME *<br><br>Angle brackets don't appear like that in ABNF.<br><br>3.4: Again, incorrect ABNF, if that's what it's meant to be.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This memo specifies the Logging interface between a downstream CDN (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN) that are interconnected as per the CDN Interconnection (CDNI) framework.&nbsp; First, it describes a reference model for CDNI logging.&nbsp; Then, it specifies the CDNI Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI Logging Files.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>We had a lot of discussion regarding the security of the logging files, specifically as it relates to non-repudiation.&nbsp; Originally, the logging draft had text regarding non-repudiation, but later we determined non-repudiation was not as mature of a solution relative the rest of the logging draft and there was other work regarding non-repudiation occurring in the IETF.&nbsp; We decided to remove all references to non-repudiation for the following reasons:&nbsp; 1) Avoid the potential of defining anything for non-repudiation within CDNi and creating a conflict with other IETF work; 2) the requirement for non-repudiation was not a critical requirement for the logging draft.<br><br>Recently, we had discussion and debate over which drafts should define the advertisement of capabilities (I.e., what logging fields are required to be supported).&nbsp; This was specifically related to the Footprint and Capabilities Interface (FCI) draft (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-04">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-04</a>).&nbsp; Ideally, capability advertisement would be defined with the interfaces themselves, but the FCI draft is not as mature as this (and other drafts).&nbsp; As a result of vigorous discussion, we decided to remove a placeholder for the FCI advertisement information from the logging draft.&nbsp; In the future, the FCI draft will define the template for FCI objects and a registry for FCI objects.&nbsp; We will publish a separate RFC for capability advertisement for the logging interface.&nbsp; We determined this approach as the best trade-off between draft publish expediency and necessary functionality.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>CDNI interfaces are still mostly in prototypes with plans for production support.&nbsp; Vendors, such as Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent, continue to progress the development and testing of the CDNI solution space, including the logging draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents.

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This memo specifies the Logging interface between a downstream CDN (dCDN) and an upstream CDN (uCDN) that are interconnected as per the CDN Interconnection (CDNI) framework.&nbsp; First, it describes a reference model for CDNI logging.&nbsp; Then, it specifies the CDNI Logging File format and the actual protocol for exchange of CDNI Logging Files.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>We had a lot of discussion regarding the security of the logging files, specifically as it relates to non-repudiation.&nbsp; Originally, the logging draft had text regarding non-repudiation, but later we determined non-repudiation was not as mature of a solution relative the rest of the logging draft and there was other work regarding non-repudiation occurring in the IETF.&nbsp; We decided to remove all references to non-repudiation for the following reasons:&nbsp; 1) Avoid the potential of defining anything for non-repudiation within CDNi and creating a conflict with other IETF work; 2) the requirement for non-repudiation was not a critical requirement for the logging draft.<br><br>Recently, we had discussion and debate over which drafts should define the advertisement of capabilities (I.e., what logging fields are required to be supported).&nbsp; This was specifically related to the Footprint and Capabilities Interface (FCI) draft (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-04">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-04</a>).&nbsp; Ideally, capability advertisement would be defined with the interfaces themselves, but the FCI draft is not as mature as this (and other drafts).&nbsp; As a result of vigorous discussion, we decided to remove a placeholder for the FCI advertisement information from the logging draft.&nbsp; In the future, the FCI draft will define the template for FCI objects and a registry for FCI objects.&nbsp; We will publish a separate RFC for capability advertisement for the logging interface.&nbsp; We determined this approach as the best trade-off between draft publish expediency and necessary functionality.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>CDNI interfaces are still mostly in prototypes with plans for production support.&nbsp; Vendors, such as Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent, continue to progress the development and testing of the CDNI solution space, including the logging draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Daryl Malas (co-chair of CDNI) is the document shepherd, and Spencer Dawkins is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I completed a full review of the draft prior to submission to the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>I have no concerns.&nbsp; We completed a WGLC, a 3rd party review and expert&nbsp; (Ops Area – David Harrington) review of this draft.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>Due to the Ops nature of this draft, we requested and received a thorough review from an expert in this area, David Harrington.&nbsp; We discussed and included necessary changes based on this review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>I have no concerns with this draft.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors confirmed there is no IPR to be disclosed on this draft.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>We have solid consensus with no concerns.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>Nits have been checked, and there are no “boilerplate” issues.&nbsp; We have a few miscellaneous issues, which can be resolved during IESG review, if necessary.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>N/A<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>I have reviewed the IANA considerations section to ensure it aligns with the body of the work whereas new registry items are properly defined in prior sections.&nbsp; Everything appears to be well defined, referenced and instructions described for future allocations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>[Question: If the format is followed as described in the draft, is an expert review required?&nbsp; Is it recommended? I would like guidance on this as a document shepherd.&nbsp; Thanks.]<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>We have not completed an formal reviews of the included XML code.&nbsp; I request guidance on the right contact for pursing this.<br></div></td>
