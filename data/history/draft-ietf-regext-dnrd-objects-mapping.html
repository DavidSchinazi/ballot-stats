 o&nbsp; A&nbsp; element that contains the number of objects in the SRS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at a specific point in time (watermark) regardless of the type of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deposit: Differential, Full or Incremental.&nbsp; The&nbsp; element<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supports the following attributes:<br><br>If the count is supposed to be for objects in the SRS, why do we have<br>the "uri" that distinguishes between the XML and CSV models?&nbsp;

 This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas<br>&nbsp;  conforming to a registry mechanism described in [<a href="/doc/rfc3688/">RFC3688</a>].&nbsp; Fourteen<br>&nbsp;  URI assignments have been registered by the IANA.<br><br>"Fourteen" does not seem accurate any more.<br><br>(Also, it is maybe a bit overzealous to use the generic "csv" prefix<br>for the RDE CSV usage, though I do not specifically object to doing so.)<br><br>Section 13<br><br>Thanks for what's here already; it covers a lot of good stuff.<br><br>We should also say something about the level of trust placed in the<br>escrow agent.&nbsp; One might imagine a scenario where the data placed in<br>escrow is signed by the registry in a way that can be verified<br>post-facto by not only the escrow agent but other entities as well; in<br>this case the escrow agent is trusted only to preserve an accurate copy<br>and provide "new enough" data.&nbsp; That does not seem to be the trust model<br>used by this scheme, since we also must trust the escrow agent to<br>provide a faithful copy of what the registry gave it, in the case when a<br>recovery is needed.&nbsp; Whether or not this presents significant risk is a<br>policy and perhaps contractual matter, so it's not problematic from the<br>specification point of view, but we should document that we make this<br>strong assumption of trust of the escrow agent.&nbsp; (This is particularly<br>true due to the number of things that are negotiated out of band between<br>registry and escrow agent, which would of course not be covered by any<br>in-protocol indication of source authenticity.)<br><br>In a similar vein, we might mention that there's no protocol mechanism<br>to detect a registry providing bogus data to an escrow agent.&nbsp; (I'm sure<br>there are legal/contractual mechanisms in place to do so, though!)<br><br>It's also important to discuss the vagaries of quoting/escaping in the<br>CSV format, especially so since we allow for the separator to be<br>specified manually.&nbsp; The parser needs to ensure that only the intended<br>separators are treated as separators and ignore that character when it<br>is quoted or escaped (as appropriate) for appearance in the body of a<br>given field.<br><br>I would suggest some mention that the various datastructures include a<br>few places that have some internal redundancy, and that if the values<br>become inconsistent there can be harmful consequences (e.g., if<br>different entities use different fields as their reference).<br><br>&nbsp;  Note: if Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used when providing an<br>&nbsp;  escrow services, the recommendations in [<a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a>] MUST be<br>&nbsp;  implemented.<br><br>Please cite this as <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a>.<br><br>Section 19<br><br>Perhaps the YYYYMMDD could be replaced with non-placeholder values to<br>make the example more realistic?<br><br>Should there also be examples for the CSV contents of the indicated<br>files?&nbsp; (This would also give the opportunity to show that the checksum<br>of the content matches the value indicated in the example XML.)<br><br>Section 21.1<br><br>If it is not needed for the textual representation of an IPv4 address,<br><a href="/doc/rfc791/">RFC 791</a> seems to otherwise not be referenced.<br><br>Section 21.2<br><br>Since SHA-256 is a "MAY", that might qualify <a href="/doc/rfc6234/">RFC 6234</a> as a normative<br>reference (per<br><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/</a>)<br><br>Likewise for <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC 7525</a>, which is a MUST when TLS is used.</div></td>

The authors<br>thought that the changes were not substantive, but there were enough of<br>them to warrant a second working group last call. That last call was<br>initiated on 26 October and ended on 8 November. This second last call<br>was extended to 22 November due to a lack of last call feedback. The<br>second last call was completed successfully with multiple expressions of<br>support and no expressions of concern.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>The data format specifications contained in this document have been<br>implemented in support of more than 1,200 generic Top-Level Domains.

The document completed a working group last<br>call on 4 October 2019. Eight individuals expressed support for<br>publication of the document and no dissent was recorded. This last call<br>identified an interoperability issue and a number of editorial issues, so<br>a new version of the document was produced and a second working group<br>last call was started on 26 October 2019. There were no expressions of<br>concern raised during the working group last call process.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>The AD is asking for further review from the Internationalization<br>Directorate, specifically on Section 10, which RECOMMENDS UTF-8 but allows<br>UTF-16.&nbsp; The working group cites <a href="/doc/rfc5730/">RFC 5730</a>, Section 5, and aligns with that.<br>The AD would prefer to deprecate UTF-16, and notes that <a href="/doc/rfc5730/">RFC 5730</a>, is now<br>well over 10 years old.&nbsp; Other opinions will be useful.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has<br>indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I have no specific concerns or issues with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>I could not find any IPR disclosures on the IETF IPR disclosure page<br>(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/</a>). Given that there are no known<br>disclosures, there has been no discussion of IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Multiple people expressed support for the document, but it's more of a<br>"concurrence of a few individuals" situation (primarily those associated<br>with ICANN's generic Top-Level Domain program) than the WG as a whole.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No one has threatened an appeal or expressed extreme discontent.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>The idnits tool notes normative references to non-RFC documents.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>There are no normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>The document includes normative references to an ISO specification (ISO<br>Standard 3166) and an ITU specification (ITU-T Recommendation E.164). The<br>document also includes a normative reference to <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a>. All other<br>normative references are to Standards Track documents.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No, this document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.<br>Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed<br>specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations<br>procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name<br>for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>The document requests IANA registration of an XML namespace and an XML<br>schema. These are subject to expert review. I've reviewed the<br>registration requests and suggested a modification:<br><br>"The IANA Considerations section requests registration of multiple XML<br>namespaces and XML schemas. For example,<br>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rdeCsv-1.0 and<br>urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:rdeCsv-1.0. Recent convention has been to<br>include “epp” in the URIs for EPP-associated namespaces and schemas, e.g.<br>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:. That convention should be<br>followed here, making the requested values<br>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:rdeCsv-1.0 and<br>urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:rdeCsv-1.0."<br><br>The authors have declined to make this change due to the large number of<br>deployed, operational implementations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.

These escrow deposists are intended to provide a source of backup data to reconstitute a domain name registry in the unlikely situation of unrecoverable data loss.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>This document was first published as an individual submission Internet-Draft in March, 2012. It was adopted by the REGEXT working group in June, 2019. A working group last call was started on 20 September, 2019. Multiple people expressed support for progression of the document. The authors of the document found interoperability issues during the working group last call and had to produce a new version. The authors thought that the changes were not substantive, but there were enough of them to warrant a second working group last call. That last call was initiated on 26 October and ended on 8 November. This second last call was extended to 22 November due to a lack of repeated expressions of support for progression. More TBD...<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>The data format specifications contained in this document have been implemented in support of more than 1,200 generic Top-Level Domains.

The document completed a working group last call on 4 October 2019. Eight individuals expressed support for publication of the document and no dissent was recorded. This last call identified an interoperability issue and a number of editorial issues, so a new version of the document was produced and a second working group last call was started on 26 October 2019.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No additional reviews are required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of?
