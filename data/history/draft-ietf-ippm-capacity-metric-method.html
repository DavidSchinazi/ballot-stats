Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This memo revisits the problem of Network Capacity metrics first<br>&nbsp;  examined in <a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>.&nbsp; The memo specifies a more practical Maximum<br>&nbsp;  IP-layer Capacity metric definition catering for measurement<br>&nbsp;  purposes, and outlines the corresponding methods of measurement.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group has consensus to publish this document. There was no particular controversy in the working group regarding this document, but the group did provide useful and detailed feedback and review.<br><br>The IESG did provide feedback that led to substantial revisions, and a second working group last call on the revision had WG consensus.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document represents a standardized definition of concepts that have existed and been documented informationally previously (<a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>). This document covers the background and motivation for providing a clearer definition of the metric and method for IP capacity.<br><br>The document received detailed review from several (4+) involved working group members, which improved the quality and clarity of the document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Tommy Pauly is the Document Shepherd. Martin Duke is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has reviewed the document since before its adoption, and has tracked the updates. The shepherd believes this version is ready to forward to the IESG. There are a few nits (see below), but those can be addressed with any AD review comments.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns; the document has received a good amount of review, among the more detailed for an IPPM document for the time it was in the group.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No, the IPPM WG has the correct expertise for this topic.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus for this document represented various different communities in IPPM, and was a strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There is one nit around updating the boilerplate for <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> language.<br><br>There are also several normative references to Informational RFCs that should be updated to informative.<br><a href="/doc/rfc2330/">RFC 2330</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc2544/">RFC 2544</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc3148/">RFC 3148</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7312/">RFC 7312</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7594/">RFC 7594</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC 7799</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8337/">RFC 8337</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8468/">RFC 8468</a><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes, but some need updating (see above).<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Yes (see above). These likely should be updated.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No status changes.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA Considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>None applicable.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>No YANG module.</div></td>

Method of Measurement<br><br>I think the metrics are fine, what makes me quite worried here is the measurement method. My concerns with it are the following.<br><br>1. The application of this measurement method is not clearly scoped. Therefore I will assume that across the Internet measurements are possible. However in that context I think the definition and protection against severe congestion has significant short comings. The main reason is that the during a configurable time period (default 1 s) the sender will attempt to send at a specified rate by a table independently on what happens during that second. <br><br>2. The algorithm for adjusting rate is table driven but give no guidance on how to construct the table and limitations on value changes in the table. In addition the algorithm discusses larger steps in the table without any reflection of what theses steps sides may represent in offered load. <br><br>3. Third the algorithms reaction to any sequence number gaps is dependent on delay and how it is related to unspecified delay thresholds. Also no text discussion how these thresholds should be configured for safe operation. <br><br>B) Section 8. Method of Measurement<br><br>There are no specification of the measurement protocol here that provides sequence numbers, and the feedback channel as well as the control channel. Is this intended to use TWAMP? <br><br>From my perspective this document defines the metrics on standards track level. However, the method for actually running the measurements are not specified on a standards track level. No one can build implementation. And if the section is intended to provide requirements on a protocol that performs these measurements I think several aspects are missing. There appear several ways forward here to resolve this; one is to split out the method of measurement and define it separately to standard tracks level using a particular protocol, another is to write it purely as requirements on a measurement protocols.</div></td>

 This section sets requirements for the following components to<br>&nbsp;  support the Maximum IP-layer Capacity Metric.<br><br>editorial/nit: I don't think I understand what "the following<br>components" are.&nbsp; Is this referencing some preexisting template for a<br>metric definition?&nbsp; (Same for §6 and §7.)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The number of these IP-layer bits is designated n0[dtn,dtn+1] for a<br>&nbsp;  specific dt.<br><br>(editorial) I'm a little confused by this notation for n0.&nbsp; In Section 4<br>we say that "dtn" references a specific sub-interval, but the brackets<br>and two items look like they should be the start an end of an interval,<br>for which perhaps just the 'n' would be more appropriate (but we'd want<br>a half-open interval, and would need to worry about 0- vs 1-indexing for<br>n, etc.).<br><br>&nbsp;  Anticipating a Sample of Singletons, the interval dt SHOULD be set to<br>&nbsp;  a natural number m so that T+I = T + m*dt with dtn+1 - dtn = dt and<br>&nbsp;  with 1 &lt;= n &lt;= m.<br><br>nit: "dt [...] set to m" doesn't make any sense.<br>nit: this looks like more of a "for 1 &lt;= n &lt;= m" than an "and with".<br><br>&nbsp;

I think the introductory text should mention<br>something about "for each n" or for a given interval dtn" or similar.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; n0 is the total number of IP-layer header and payload bits that<br>&nbsp;

 o&nbsp; PM represents other performance metrics [see section 5.4 below];<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their measurement results SHALL be collected during measurement of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP-layer Capacity and associated with the corresponding dtn for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; further evaluation and reporting.<br><br>(nit) this seems to duplicate (be a subset of) the paragraph before<br>"Mathematically, this definition can be represented".<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The bit rate of the physical interface of the measurement device<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; must be higher than that of the link whose C(T,I,PM) is to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; measured.<br><br>(nit) I thought we were measuring a path, not a link.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;

 The interval dt SHOULD be set to a natural number m so that T+I = T +<br>&nbsp;  m*dt with dtn+1 - dtn = dt and with 1 &lt;= n &lt;= m.<br><br>nit: "dt [...] set to m" doesn't make any sense.<br>nit: this looks like more of a "for 1 &lt;= n &lt;= m" than an "and with".<br><br>&nbsp;

 If traffic conditioning (e.g., shaping, policing) applies along a<br>&nbsp;  path for which Maximum_C(T,I,PM) is to be determined, different<br>&nbsp;  values for dt SHOULD be picked and measurements be executed during<br>&nbsp;  multiple intervals [T, T+I].&nbsp; A single constant interval dt SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  chosen so that is an integer multiple of increasing values k times<br>&nbsp;  serialisation delay of a path MTU at the physical interface speed<br>&nbsp;  where traffic conditioning is expected.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: "so that is an integer multiple" seems to be missing a word.<br><br>Also, this seems to say that different values for dt SHOULD be picked,<br>but also that a constant dt SHOULD be chosen.&nbsp; How can those both be<br>recommended and be consistent with each other?&nbsp; (I mean, I assume that<br>the intent is to multiple runs with different (fixed) dt, but that's not<br>what the text seems to say.)<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Define the IP-layer Sender Bit Rate, B(S,st), to be the number of IP-<br>&nbsp;  layer bits (including header and data fields) that are transmitted<br>&nbsp;  from the Source during one contiguous sub-interval, st, during the<br>&nbsp;  test interval S (where S SHALL be longer than I), and where the<br>&nbsp;  fixed-size packet count during that single sub-interval st also<br>&nbsp;  provides the number of IP-layer bits in any interval: n0[stn-1,stn].<br><br>(1) there doesn't seem to be any restriction that the observed packets<br>list Dst as the destination address, so formally it seems this would<br>count *all* traffic generated by Sender, not just the traffic relevant<br>for the (path capacity) test.<br>(2) It seems a little unfortunate that we reuse the 'n0' symbol here for<br>a different meaning than in the earlier capacity metrics.<br><br>&nbsp;  Measurements according to these definitions SHALL use the UDP<br>&nbsp;  transport layer.&nbsp; Any feedback from Dst host to Src host received by<br>&nbsp;  Src host during an interval [stn-1,stn] MUST NOT result in an<br>&nbsp;  adaptation of the Src host traffic conditioning during this interval<br>&nbsp;  (rate adjustment occurs on st boundaries).<br><br>Hmm, this "MUST NOT" is interesting, as it seems to imply extremely<br>tight coordination between the measurement point for this metric and the<br>Source itself.&nbsp; (Note that the toplevel §7 admits the possibility that<br>measurement will occur at a location other than the Src host to network<br>path interface, via "(or as close as practical)".)<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  At the beginning of a test, the sender begins sending at rate R1 and<br>&nbsp;  the receiver starts a feedback timer at interval F (while awaiting<br><br>It's a little hard to search for, but I didn't find any previous mention<br>of 'F' or it being defined as a parameter or term.&nbsp; Should it be a<br>listed parameter somewhere?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the feedback indicates that sequence number anomalies were<br>&nbsp;  detected OR the delay range was above the upper threshold, the<br>&nbsp;  offered load rate is decreased.&nbsp; Also, if congestion is now confirmed<br>&nbsp;  by the current feedback message being processed, then the offered<br>&nbsp;  load rate is decreased by more than one rate (e.g., Rx-30).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Does "congestion is now confirmed" mean that "congestion confirmed" is<br>like a one-way latch and this transition only occurs at most once over<br>the course of a test?&nbsp; Or could the Rx-30 happen multiple times?<br>(The pseudocode indicates the former.)<br><br>&nbsp;  If the feedback indicates that there were no sequence number<br>&nbsp;  anomalies AND the delay range was above the lower threshold, but<br>&nbsp;  below the upper threshold, the offered load rate is not changed.<br><br>The way this is written suggests that there will always be a lower and<br>an upper threshold for delay, but the rest of the document so far didn't<br>give me that impression.&nbsp; E.g., we talk about PM only as "at least one<br>fundamental metric and target performance threshold MUST be supplied",<br>and to me having both upper and lower thresholds would be two<br>thresholds, not one.<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Here, as with any Active Capacity test, the test duration must be<br>&nbsp;  kept short. 10 second tests for each direction of transmission are<br>&nbsp;  common today.&nbsp; The default measurement interval specified here is I =<br>&nbsp;  10 seconds).&nbsp; In combination with a fast search method and user-<br>&nbsp;  network coordination, the concerns raised in <a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a>[<a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC6815</a>] are<br>&nbsp;  alleviated.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I skimmed <a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a> and had a bit of a hard time making the connection<br>for why combining a 10-second interval, fast search method, and<br>user-network coordination alleviate the concerns of <a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a>.&nbsp; There<br>doesn't seem to be much in 6815 itself about how testing in production<br>can be done safely, so my current working assumption is that the<br>conclusion presented here reflects the results of "new work" being<br>recorded for the first time (in the RFC series) in this document.&nbsp; If<br>that assumption is correct, I'd suggest spending some more words to<br>support the conclusion, e.g., making analogies to other "normal" traffic<br>patterns and how the benchmarking setup is not qualitatively different<br>from them.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  As testing continues, implementers should expect some evolution in<br>&nbsp;  the methods.&nbsp; The ITU-T has published a Supplement (60) to the<br>&nbsp;  Y-series of Recommendations, "Interpreting ITU-T Y.1540 maximum IP-<br>&nbsp;  layer capacity measurements", [Y.Sup60], which is the result of<br>&nbsp;  continued testing with the metric and method described here.<br><br>I pulled up the [Y.Sup60] reference, and it does not seem to reference<br>this draft by name.&nbsp; On what basis do we conclude that it "is the result<br>of continued testing with the metric and method described here"?<br>Skimming/searching, I do see many similar formulae and methods<br>presented, but how do we conclude they are precisely the same?<br><br>Section 10<br><br>Should we say something about making sure that I is reasonably bounded?<br>IIRC we say so elsewhere in the text but not exactly here.<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; A REQUIRED user client-initiated setup handshake between<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  cooperating hosts and allows firewalls to control inbound<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  unsolicited UDP which either go to a control port [expected and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  w/authentication] or to ephemeral ports that are only created as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  needed.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: the grammar is odd in the first part of this sentence; the part<br>before the "and" doesn't seem like it can join up with anything after<br>the "and".&nbsp; Is the intent something like "It is REQUIRED to have a user<br>client-initiated setup handshake between cooperating hosts that allows<br>firewalls to [...]"?<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; Integrity protection for feedback messages conveying measurements<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  is RECOMMENDED.<br><br>(In some sense you want authentication as well as integrity protection.)<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; Senders MUST be rate-limited.&nbsp; This can be accomplished using the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  pre-built table defining all the offered load rates that will be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  supported (Section 8.1).&nbsp; The recommended load-control search<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  algorithm results in "ramp up" from the lowest rate in the table.<br><br>nit: since (effectively) each implementation will have their own<br>pre-built table, I think it should be "using a pre-built table".<br><br>Appendix 13<br><br>If we start at Rx (row) 1, is it going to cause problems when we drop<br>down to Rx = 0 in the loss/congestion cases?<br><br>The mechcanism in the pseudocode to stop taking large increments in<br>sending rate above the "hSpeedThresh" does not seem to be described in<br>the prose in §8.1.&nbsp;

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard, which is appropriate for a specification of a standard way to measure and report maximum IP-layer capacity. The status is indicated in the header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This memo revisits the problem of Network Capacity metrics first<br>&nbsp;  examined in <a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>.&nbsp; The memo specifies a more practical Maximum<br>&nbsp;  IP-layer Capacity metric definition catering for measurement<br>&nbsp;  purposes, and outlines the corresponding methods of measurement.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group has consensus to publish this document. There was no particular controversy in the working group regarding this document, but the group did provide useful and detailed feedback and review.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document represents a standardized definition of concepts that have existed and been documented informationally previously (<a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>). This document covers the background and motivation for providing a clearer definition of the metric and method for IP capacity.<br><br>The document received detailed review from several (4+) involved working group members, which improved the quality and clarity of the document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Tommy Pauly is the Document Shepherd. Martin Duke is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has reviewed the document since before its adoption, and has tracked the updates. The shepherd believes this version is ready to forward to the IESG. There are a few nits (see below), but those can be addressed with any AD review comments.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns; the document has received a good amount of review, among the more detailed for an IPPM document for the time it was in the group.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No, the IPPM WG has the correct expertise for this topic.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus for this document represented various different communities in IPPM, and was a strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There is one nit around updating the boilerplate for <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> language.<br><br>There are also several normative references to Informational RFCs that should be updated to informative.<br><a href="/doc/rfc2330/">RFC 2330</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc2544/">RFC 2544</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc3148/">RFC 3148</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7312/">RFC 7312</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7594/">RFC 7594</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC 7799</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8337/">RFC 8337</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8468/">RFC 8468</a><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes, but some need updating (see above).<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Yes (see above). These likely should be updated.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No status changes.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA Considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>None applicable.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>No YANG module.</div></td>

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard, which is appropriate for a specification of a standard way to measure and report maximum IP-layer capacity. The status is indicated in the header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This memo revisits the problem of Network Capacity metrics first<br>&nbsp;  examined in <a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>.&nbsp; The memo specifies a more practical Maximum<br>&nbsp;  IP-layer Capacity metric definition catering for measurement<br>&nbsp;  purposes, and outlines the corresponding methods of measurement.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group has consensus to publish this document. There was no particular controversy in the working group regarding this document, but the group did provide useful and detailed feedback and review.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document represents a standardized definition of concepts that have existed and been documented informationally previously (<a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a>). This document covers the background and motivation for providing a clearer definition of the metric and method for IP capacity.<br><br>The document received detailed review from several (4+) involved working group members, which improved the quality and clarity of the document.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Tommy Pauly is the Document Shepherd. Martin Duke is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has reviewed the document since before its adoption, and has tracked the updates. The shepherd believes this version is ready to forward to the IESG. There are a few nits (see below), but those can be addressed with any AD review comments.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns; the document has received a good amount of review, among the more detailed for an IPPM document for the time it was in the group.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No, the IPPM WG has the correct expertise for this topic.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The consensus for this document represented various different communities in IPPM, and was a strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There is one nit around updating the boilerplate for <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> language.<br><br>There are also several normative references to Informational RFCs that should be updated to informative.<br><a href="/doc/rfc2330/">RFC 2330</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc2544/">RFC 2544</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc3148/">RFC 3148</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc5136/">RFC 5136</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc6815/">RFC 6815</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7312/">RFC 7312</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7594/">RFC 7594</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC 7799</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8337/">RFC 8337</a><br><a href="/doc/rfc8468/">RFC 8468</a><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes, but some need updating (see above).<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Yes (see above). These likely should be updated.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No status changes.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA Considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>None applicable.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>No YANG module.</div></td>
