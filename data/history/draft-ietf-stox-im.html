Thanks for that.<br><br>I have a couple of you-need-smarter-ADs questions. As prologue, please remember I have a decent understanding of SIP, an indecent understanding of SIMPLE, and mostly, I just stare uncomprehendingly when I see raw XMPP.<br><br>It did not jump out at me when reading this specification, whether there is any assurance to a sender on one side of the gateway that a message was delivered successfully to a receiver on the other side of the gateway. If there's not, that might be worth pointing out a bit earlier than a Note: halfway through page 5.<br><br>Is there a possible mismatch between what a sender thinks is happening, TLS-wise, on one side of the gateway, and what a receiver actually receives, TLS-wise, on the other side? I'm not smart enough to ask the right question, but if an XMPP sender knows she's sending over TLS, but the XMPP-to-SIP gateway maps that into a non-TLS SIP transaction on the other side, is the kind of scenario I'm thinking of. If so, perhaps it's worth pointing that out someplace (the Security Considerations section would be fine).</div></td>

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This document has been initially reviewed in the DISPATCH WG as per the RAI area process for new work. The STOX WG has been chartered as a result of the submission of this and other documents that aim to define specifications for interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based systems. This document has been subjected to a number of thorough reviews initially in the DISPATCH WG and in the STOX WG after its creation. All comments and suggestions of the reviewers have been taken into account in the document subsequent updates. The document is short and focused on one specific mapping definition and there were no controversial points regarding it.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol?
