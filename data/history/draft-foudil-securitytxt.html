I think it will be an easy discussion and quick resolution.<br><br>— Section 3.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  A "security.txt" file that is found in a file system MUST only apply<br>&nbsp;  to the folder in which it is located and that folder's subfolders.<br>&nbsp;  The file does not apply to any of the folder's parent or sibling<br>&nbsp;  folders.<br><br>You don’t say what happens if there are nested security.txt files.&nbsp; What’s the scope in this situation (which file applies to folder1; which applies to folder1/subfolder)?:<br><br>/example/security.txt<br>/example/folder1/<br>/example/folder1/security.txt<br>/example/folder1/subfolder/<br><br>I think the document needs to make this clear.<br><br>&nbsp;  # This security.txt file applies to IPv4 address of 192.0.2.0.<br>&nbsp;  https://192.0.2.0/.well-known/security.txt<br><br>I’m uncomfortable with trying to restrict the scope depending upon how the file was retrieved.&nbsp; If <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> resolves to 192.0.2.0, then it should not matter whether the file is retrieved via&nbsp; or&nbsp; (or via the corresponding v6 address).<br><br>— Section 3.6 —<br><br>Your examples lack the EXPIRES field that you say MUST be present.<br><br>— Section 5 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The expected file format of the security.txt file is plain text (MIME<br>&nbsp;  type "text/plain") as defined in section 4.1.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc2046/">RFC2046</a>] and is<br>&nbsp;  encoded using UTF-8 [<a href="/doc/rfc3629/">RFC3629</a>] in Net-Unicode form [<a href="/doc/rfc5198/">RFC5198</a>].<br><br>In Section 3 you say that for HTTP:<br><br>&nbsp;  It MUST have a Content-Type of "text/plain" with the<br>&nbsp;  default charset parameter set to "utf-8" (as per section 4.1.3 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc2046/">RFC2046</a>]).<br><br>It would be best to have the format requirement be consistent, however it’s retrieved, so “MUST” (rather than “expected”) is right, no?<br><br>The ABNF needs some work.&nbsp; DISCUSS-level issues here, with less important ones below:<br><br>&nbsp; signed&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  =&nbsp; sign-header unsigned sign-footer<br><br>No, the signed body doesn’t just have a header and footer around the unsigned plain text.&nbsp;

But while the order of the fields mostly doesn’t matter, the order of the Contact fields, if there are more than one, does matter.&nbsp; So you’ll have to tweak this a bit.<br><br>Give the above, I suggest this:<br><br>&nbsp;

Most protocols have settles on CRLF definitively.&nbsp; Why not here also?<br><br>— Section 3.5.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  If this field indicates a web URL<br><br>“URI”, please, and throughout the document (I see 9 instances).<br><br>Also, you might consider just factoring that bit out to avoid repeating it, and putting into Section 3.5 something like:<br><br>&nbsp;

I can see that in most cases, this information would reasonably have a lifetime of years (if I’m not using fields such as “Hiring”).&nbsp; I guess it’s not really a problem, as I could just ignore the RECOMMENDED and specify 31 Dec 2525, or some such [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Year_2525]">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Year_2525]</a>.<br><br>— Section 3.5.8 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The order in which they appear MUST NOT be interpreted as an<br>&nbsp;  indication of priority - rather these MUST be interpreted as all<br>&nbsp;  being of equal priority.<br><br>This seems like an oddly heavy use of “MUST”, as there’s no interoperability issue here.&nbsp; I suggest phrasing this without <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> key words, as:<br><br>&nbsp;  The order in which they appear is not an indication of priority;<br>&nbsp;  the listed languages are intended to have equal priority.<br><br>— Section 4.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Researchers should perform additional triage<br><br>“Triage” refers to sorting into priority groups, and doesn’t seem to be the right word here.&nbsp; I think “analysis” works better.<br><br>— Section 4.2 —<br><br>I can see many use cases where other mechanisms are preferable, and it might be best to talk about that.&nbsp; For instance, one might prefer something like this:<br><br>/users/<br>/users/admin/<br>/users/admin/security.txt<br>/users/alice/<br>/users/carol/<br><br>Or for file systems containing product code:<br><br>/products/vendor1/<br>/products/vendor1/product1/<br>/products/vendor1/product1/security.txt<br>/products/vendor1/product2/<br>/products/vendor1/product2/security.txt<br>/products/company2/<br>/products/company2/security.txt<br>/products/company2/productA/<br>/products/company2/productB/<br><br>I’m not suggesting a lot of text here, but just something to show that the SHOULD is talking about typical situations, and that there are other valid deployments.<br><br>I’ll also note that the example in Section 3.1 violates this recommendation.<br><br>— Section 5 —<br><br>&nbsp; lang-values&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; lang-tag *(*WSP "," *WSP lang-tag)<br><br>Is there really a reason to allow WSP throughout the lang-tag entries?&nbsp; Why not just have them packed together, as:<br><br>&nbsp; lang-values&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; lang-tag *(“,”lang-tag)<br><br>…so you have &lt;&lt; Preferred-Languages: en,es,fr &gt;&gt; ?&nbsp; That just seems simpler, unless there’s real value in allowing the WSP.<br><br>&nbsp; uri&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; &lt; URI as per [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] &gt;<br><br>3986 is big; I suggest “URI imported from Section 3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>]” to make it easier on the reader and to be consistent with the other definitions here.<br><br>— Section 6.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Security researchers should triage the "security.txt" file including<br>&nbsp;  verifying the digital signature and checking any available historical<br>&nbsp;  records before using the information contained in the file.<br><br>As above, “triage” is not the right word.&nbsp; I think “validate” works here.<br><br>— Section 6.7 —<br><br>&nbsp;  To protect a "security.txt" file from being tampered with in transit,<br>&nbsp;  implementors should use HTTPS (as per [<a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>]) when serving the<br>&nbsp;  file itself<br><br>Well, this is actually a MUST (rather than “should”) earlier in the draft.&nbsp; It needs to be changed to “MUST” here in order to be consistent.<br><br>&nbsp;  invalid certificate, additional human triage is recommended since the<br>&nbsp;  contents may have been modified while in transit.<br><br>Again, “triage” is wrong: “validation” or “analysis” here.<br><br>— Section 6.8 —<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, there is an increased likelihood of<br>&nbsp;  reports being sent in an automated fashion and/or as result of<br>&nbsp;  automated scans without human triage.<br><br>Again, “triage” is wrong: “analysis” here, I think.<br><br>&nbsp;  Organizations need to weigh the advantages of publishing this file<br>&nbsp;  versus the possible disadvantages and increased resources required to<br>&nbsp;  triage security reports.<br><br>“analyze”<br><br>— Section 7 —<br><br>At least the first two paragraphs are unnecessary (and I’m not sure the third is useful either, but it might have some value).<br><br>— Section 7.2 —<br><br>&nbsp;

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  When security risks are discovered by independent security<br>&nbsp;  researchers, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly.<br>&nbsp;  As a result, security issues may be left unreported.&nbsp; This document<br>&nbsp;  defines a standard ("security.txt") to help organizations describe<br>&nbsp;  the process for security researchers to follow in order to disclose<br>&nbsp;  security vulnerabilities securely.<br><br> Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was the document considered in any WG, and if so, why was<br>&nbsp; it not adopted as a work item there? Was there controversy<br>&nbsp; about particular points that caused the WG to not adopt the<br>&nbsp; document?<br><br>&nbsp; This is an AD sponsored draft and was discussed on the SAAG mailing list.&nbsp; This draft was also presented at IETF 101 in the SecDispatch session, resulting in the consensus decision that this document go forward as an AD sponsored document.&nbsp; There was quite a bit of discussion on the SAAG list and all technical comments seem to have been addressed.&nbsp; There was one suggestion that RDAP might be better suited, saying that if the system were to be compromised , there would be no way of noticing if the security.txt had been modified (assuming new signature is placed on the file).&nbsp; Otherwise, there was agreement to publish and there was active experiments to test this process early in the draft's history.<br><br> Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>There are active implementations of the security.txt file that were noted by reviewers of the draft on list in addition to the UK NCSC mentioned off-list. Contributors are mentioned by way of reference to the SAAG list.&nbsp; There are a few that could merit being called out specifically as they did influence some positive updates to the draft.<br><br> Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Kathleen Moriarty is the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; Benjamin Kaduk is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>The shepherd provided a published technical review of the draft to the SAAG list.&nbsp; Once that was addressed, the shepherd checked with authors/editors on knowledge of IPR finding xxxxx.&nbsp; Next the shepherd reviewed all list communication on the draft to find that all actionable comments had been addressed.&nbsp; The shepherd also reached out to Paul Woulters who was in opposition to this approach to solve the problem and found he remains not in favor. <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/WoVRqcqmWdbE4mZo42XHBCKb9vg">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/WoVRqcqmWdbE4mZo42XHBCKb9vg</a> <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No, it describes a text file.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs<br>is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why<br>the interested community considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No. This document does not update any existing document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.
