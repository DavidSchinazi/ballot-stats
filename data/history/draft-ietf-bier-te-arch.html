I agree with TSVART reviewer (Thanks Tommy Pauly) that this seems useful to reduce duplicate packets to avoid unnecessary effects in the higher layers.<br><br>I have two clarification questions:<br><br>* Section 5.3.6.2: if there is 6 SIs in the example then why does the it loops through only 5 of them? see the text below -<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; On all area edge BFR, bea in<br>&nbsp;  BIFT:SI=k|k=2...6 is populated with forward_routed(BFRka) and beb in<br>&nbsp;  BIFT:SI=k with forward_routed(BFRkb).<br><br>&nbsp;  For BIER-TE forwarding of a packet to a subset of BFERs across all<br>&nbsp;  areas, a BFIR would create at most 6 copies, with SI=1...SI=6, <br><br>* This might be completely my misunderstanding, however, I understood that BIER-TE supports multiple domains and subdomains, where multiple domains may not be under same implementer. In that case, would their not be issues for BIER-TE controllers to show robust behavior if there is no default ECMP algorithm? Also the implementer is expected to document their ECMP of choice, I didn't understand in what format and to who the documentation applies. Also there is no discussions on what happens if there is no such documentation.</div></td>

Even if section 6 is really light on the topic.<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>Please expand "BIFT" and "BFR" at first use as other BIER terms are expanded.<br><br>-- Section 2.4 --<br>The blanket/broad statement that "Forwarding of BIER-TE is designed to easily build/program common forwarding hardware with BIER." is it applicable to all hardware handling BIER ? Or is it vendor specific ?<br><br>-- Section 3.2.1 --<br>As BIER-TE is basically centralized in a control, "such YANG/Netconf/RestConf" is a little hand waving. Does the BIER WG have already started work on this control protocol ?<br><br>-- Section 4.2.3 --<br>What is the "entropy parameter" ? where is it defined ? (to repeat myself, I am not a BIER expert) if the entropy is part of the BIER header then strong suggestion to s/entropy parameter/value of the entropy field of the BIER header/.<br><br>-- Section 4.3 --<br>Do the authors have an idea on how to share the BIFT-id address space among BIER (which is decentralized AFAIK) and BIER-TE (which is centralized) without overlapping and keeping the separation during all operations (including when nodes/links appear/disappear) ?<br><br>-- Section 6 --<br>While discussing about SR, did the WG think about using <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> network programming to achieve the same results as BIER-TE ?<br><br>Unsure whether the note about "BIER itself" brings any value in this BIER-TE document.<br><br>Unsure what the last § has to do with segment routing.<br><br>To be honest, this section is really light and the document would gain by removing it.<br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>Please use the all uppercase "YANG" rather than "Yang" as it is an acronym.<br><br><br>-- Section 2.3 --<br>s/that is forwarding plane is a simple extension/that its forwarding plane is a simple extension/ ?</div></td>

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd has reviewed the version 8 of draft-ietf-bier-te-arch. Her concerns where addressed by the authors in version 9. She believes this version is now ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>Yes. See acknowledgement section for list of key reviewers, including Lou Berger, TEAS chair. This document has been reviewed, and there is no concern about depth or breadth about the previous reviews.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd has no concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The Shepherd received confirmation from all authors that all IPR they are aware of has been disclosed to the IETF:<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-bier-te-arch">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-bier-te-arch</a> <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There is no IPR-related discussion. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The WG consensus for this draft is very solid.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Negative.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>The shepherd has verified idnits.

The intend status of the document is correctly indicated, formal review criteria are met (are not applicable).<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Not relevant.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes the document is split to normative and informative references. Documents that are normative references are in a clear state (no pending or downrevs).<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>This document requests no action by IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>Not relevant.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>Not relevant.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Bitstring sematic of BIER-TE is different from BIER defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8279/">RFC 8279</a>, which indicates adjacencies, but it could reuse the forwarding engine of BIER. The BIFT of each BFR only contains the BPs that are adjacent to the BFR in BIER-TE topology. BIER-TE doesn’t depend on any IGP protocols as routing underlay.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>The name of the mechanism defined in the draft has been discussed during last call, which was changed from “BIER traffic engineering” to “BIER tree engineering”, considering that it only covers the path steering function in the overall solution of traffic engineering. Any BIER traffic engineering mechanism could use this mechanism.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>After full discussions and multiple revisions, there is solid consensus for this document in WG.
