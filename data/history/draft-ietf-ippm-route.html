I had to read it multiple time and am still having a hard time with the nested clauses. Perhaps:<br>"This also specifies a framework for active methods of measurement which uses the techniques described in [PT], as well as a framework for hybrid active-passive methods of measurement(such as the Hybrid Type I method [<a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC7799</a>])."<br><br>3: " Node Identity&nbsp; The unique address for Nodes communicating within the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network domain.&nbsp; For Nodes communicating on the Internet with IP,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it is the globally routable IP address(es) which the Node uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when communicating with other Nodes under normal or error<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conditions. "<br>I'm not sure I understand -- this says the "unique address" and also "IP address(es)" - it cannot be both singular/unique and multiple. This definition needs clarification or a pointer to later in the document.<br><br>4: "Cooperating Node&nbsp; Nodes that MUST respond to direct queries for their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Node identity as part of a previously agreed and established<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interrogation protocol.

I recognize that this terminology comes from <a href="/doc/rfc2330/">RFC2330</a>, but it is till confusing. An additional clarification that this term is being used because of history would probably help.&nbsp; <br><br>7: "Next define a *singleton* definition for a Hop on the path, with sufficient indexes to identify all Hops identified in a measurement interval."<br>I'm not sure that "singleton" is a well understood term outside of software engineering, and that you need to better explain it (esp because you have felt it important enough to emphasize). Perhaps "data structure to uniquely identify a hop" or similar? <br><br>8: "&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If a pair of discovered Nodes identify two different addresses,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then they will appear to be different Nodes.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If a pair of discovered Nodes identify two different IP addresses,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IP addresses resolve to the same Node name (in the DNS),<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then they will appear to be the same Nodes."<br>Please either include "IP" in both or neither of the above, otherwise it sounds like it is a differentiating factor. <br><br>9: " UDP and TCP are used when a particular characteristic needs to<br>&nbsp;  be verified, such as filtering or traffic shaping on specific ports<br>&nbsp;  (i.e., services). "<br>TCP traceroute is also used when ICMP responses are not received - while "such as filtering" *could* cover this, it would require squinting...<br><br>10: "Furthermore, either Paris-traceroute or<br>&nbsp;  Scamper is capable of unveiling the many available paths between a<br>&nbsp;  source and destination (which are visible to this method)." <br>Visible to *which* method?

 techniques.&nbsp; The former scenario is defined according to [<a href="/doc/rfc2991/">RFC2991</a>],<br>&nbsp;  while the latter generates a round-robin scheme to deliver every new<br>&nbsp;  outgoing packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I was surprised to see "packet-based techniques" refer to a round-robin<br>scheme for queuing outgoing packets across interfaces, but assume this<br>just means I need to do more background reading.&nbsp; Any tips for where to<br>start?<br><br>&nbsp;  Formally, to maintain the same flow in the measurements to a<br>&nbsp;  particular hop, the Type-P-Route-Ensemble-Method-Variant packets<br>&nbsp;  should be[PT]:<br><br>It's not entirely clear that we need a reference for these attributes;<br>they seem to be fairly easy to verify independently, IIUC.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; TCP case: For IPv4, the fields Src, Dst, port-Src, port_Dst,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sequence number, and Diffserv Field SHOULD be the same.&nbsp; For IPv6,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the field FlowLabel, Src and Dst SHOULD be the same.<br><br>Are we happy to pair "to maintain the same flow" (previous paragraph)<br>with "SHOULD be the same" (here, and subsequent bullet points)?<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; SHOULD occasionally check path portions which have exhibited<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  stable results over time, particularly ingress and egress<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  portions of the path.<br><br>Do we want to give any (e.g., order of magnitude) guidance for<br>"occasionally"?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition to node identity, nodes may also identify the ingress and<br>&nbsp;  egress interfaces utilized by the tracing packet, the time of day<br>&nbsp;  when the packet was processed, and other generic data (as described<br><br>nit: I'd consider "absolute time" over "time of day", since the latter<br>may have connotations of implying that there is 24-hour-periodic<br>behavior.&nbsp; (It may also be subject to local time zone on the node<br>inserting the value.)<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Nodes at the ingress to the domain SHOULD be both Discoverable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and Cooperating, and SHOULD reveal the same Node Identity in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  response to both active and hybrid methods.<br><br>The second clause here seems redundant with point (2) that follows.<br>(Similarly for point (3)'s similar clause.)&nbsp; That is, the recommendation<br>to use the same identity for both methods can only ever apply when the<br>node in question is both Discoverable and Cooperating -- if it's only<br>one, then there will only be one identity available, and no need for<br>consistency across methods.<br><br>&nbsp;  When Nodes follow these requirements, it becomes a simple matter to<br><br>Perhaps a philosophical question, but are "SHOULD"-level directives more<br>of "requirements" or "guidelines"?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  traffic load is not stationary.&nbsp; Nonetheless, as the first approach,<br>&nbsp;  a link seems to be congested if, after sending several traceroute<br>&nbsp;  probes, it is possible to detect congestion observing different<br>&nbsp;  statistics parameters (e.g., see [IDCong]).&nbsp; Finally, to recognize<br><br>nit: please check the wording of this sentence; I think there may be a<br>missing word or similar.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  every hop.&nbsp; This procedure could be done for a single Member Route<br>&nbsp;  flow, with parameter E set as False, or for every detected Route<br>&nbsp;  Ensemble flow (E=True).<br><br>nit: I don't think we define 'E' until the full procedure, a few<br>paragraphs below.<br><br>&nbsp;  made.&nbsp; Line 8 and 13 set a timer for each cycle of measurements.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  cycle comprises the traceroutes packets, considering every possible<br>&nbsp;  Hop and the alternatives paths in the Alt variable (ensured in lines<br>&nbsp;  9-12).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I recognize that this is pseudocode, but "what if the<br>advanced-traceroute() operation takes longer than the i_t time?"<br><br>Section 7<br><br>We could consider some bland statement about the measurement<br>technologies (e.g., ICMP) not providing cryptographic protection for the<br>requested/returned data, and the risks of processing untrusted data in<br>general.&nbsp; This is particularly true for reverse DNS data, used in<br>determining whether node identities represent the same node or not,<br>since DNSSEC deployment remains inconsistent (especially for the reverse<br>zone).<br><br>&nbsp;  The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of<br>&nbsp;  live paths are relevant here as well.&nbsp; See [<a href="/doc/rfc4656/">RFC4656</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc5357/">RFC5357</a>].<br><br>(The security considerations of 5357 don't seem to be adding much<br>discussion, here, though I don't object to referencing it.)<br><br>Section 9<br><br>Should we intuitively know who the "original 3 authors" are?<br><br>Section 11.1<br><br>I was surprised to see <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data/">draft-ietf-ippm-ioam-data</a> in the normative<br>references section, as all the previous discussion was consistent with<br>merely an informative reference.<br><br>Similarly, RFCs 5388, 5835, 6437, and 7312 do not seem to be referenced<br>in a fashion that requires a normative reference.</div></td>
