The requirements identified in this document are<br>&nbsp;  related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of Point-<br>&nbsp;  to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the<br>&nbsp;  standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential<br>&nbsp;  applications, Point-to-Multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the<br>&nbsp;  support of multicast layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service<br>&nbsp;  and Virtual Private Multicast Service) as defined in the Layer 2<br>&nbsp;  Virtual Private Network Working Group.<br><br>I thought common practice was that we didn't refer to working groups (which conclude) in RFCs (that last forever)?<br><br>More than a nit, but not a Discuss: This draft contains a fair number of SHOULDs with no guidance on why you might not or what happens if you don't. I don't have anywhere near the background to question specific SHOULDs ... with maybe one or two exceptions, like:<br><br>3.4.5. Failure Detection and Reporting<br><br>&nbsp;  -&nbsp; In case of failure, it SHOULD correctly report which Leaf PEs are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; affected.&nbsp; This SHOULD be realized by enhancing existing PW<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; methods, such as LDP Status Notification.&nbsp; The notification<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message SHOULD include the type of fault (P2MP PW, AC or PSN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel).<br><br>Are there network operators who think it will be awesome to see failure reports that don't tell them what Leaf PEs are affected, or don't tell them the type of fault? <br><br>Maybe that's normal in the PW world, and that would be fine if it's true, but I'm imagining seeing a failure report that says "Something bad happened, but I can't tell you much about it. You should worry. Good luck on finding it" :D</div></td>

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>Informational. It's a requirements and frameworks draft, there is no protocol being specified. Yes, it's on the title page.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract<br>&nbsp; and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be<br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract<br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for<br>providing a Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire (PW) over MPLS PSNs.&nbsp; The<br>requirements identified in this document are related to architecture,<br>signaling and maintenance aspects of Point-to-Multipoint PW<br>operation.&nbsp; They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization<br>of such mechanisms.&nbsp; Among other potential applications, Point-to-<br>Multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast layer<br>2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast<br>Service) as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network Working<br>Group.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For<br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or<br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly<br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This draft has taken a while as it required extensive rewriting by a new editor following the previous time it was submitted to the IESG. This added quite a bit of time to the process, but has greatly improved the quality of the draft.<br><br>There was a bit of controversy regarding a late IPR declaration. That is discussed in section 8 below.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a<br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to<br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that<br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review,<br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If<br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review,<br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type<br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>As this is a requirements and framework draft, there can be no implementations.<br><br>Stewart Bryant deserves special mention as the AD that resulted in the document largely being re-written, which improved its quality.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>Andy Malis, Stewart Bryant.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd has worked with the authors through the draft's later revisions, and proposed new text to clear the IPR situation discussed in section 8.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>None at this point.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>Yes. This IPR disclosure, #2249, came in very late in the process, and the inventors were two of the co-authors. While one could argue that it's hard to worry about IPR when there's no protocol being defined or anything to implement, the WG chairs (with the consensus of the WG) decided to be extra cautious, and new text was written that removed the optional procedure that was the subject of the IPR disclosure. Thus, to be precise, that IPR disclosure no longer applies to the revision of the draft that is now being submitted to the IESG, but rather to an earlier revision.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Yes, it has good WG consensus. Given the IPR and other discussions, the WG is very aware of this draft.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>There is one miscellaneous warning regarding pre-RFC5378 text. The -00 version of this draft is dated 9/4/08, which is pre-RFC5378. The RFC Editor can ensure that the proper boilerplate is used for this case.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No, but there is one informative reference still in progress, draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpms-frmwk-requirements-05. Note that this draft expired about 10 months ago. The IESG may wish to simply remove this reference, or leave it as a work in progress and see if it can be renewed or progressed.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in<br>the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified.

Does the Document Shepherd have<br>any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that<br>have been performed?<br><br>Yes, the document has received adequate discussion and review. The<br>document went through last call in the PWE3 working group, and the<br>only comment received during last call was regarding a single typo,<br>which can be corrected following IESG review. That typo is:<br><br>In the title of section 4.2<br>replace "P2MP SS-PW Underlying Layer"<br>by "P2MP MS-PW Underlying Layer"<br><br>(1.c) Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document<br>needs more review from a particular or broader perspective,<br>e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with<br>AAA, internationalization or XML?<br><br>No.<br><br>(1.d) Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or<br>issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he<br>or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or<br>has concerns whether there really is a need for it.

Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with<br>others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and<br>agree with it?<br><br>I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants.<br><br>(1.f) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in<br>separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

This document is not subject to MIB<br>doctor or other reviews.<br><br>(1.h) Has the document split its references into normative and<br>informative? Are there normative references to documents that<br>are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear<br>state? If such normative references exist, what is the<br>strategy for their completion? Are there normative references<br>that are downward references, as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC3967</a>]? If<br>so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure for them [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC3967</a>].<br><br>Yes, the references are split appropriately. All of the normative<br>references are to published RFCs, with no downrefs (the intended<br>category is Informational). The two informative references are both WG<br>drafts (but in other working groups).<br><br>(1.i) Has the Document Shepherd verified that the document IANA<br>consideration section exists and is consistent with the body<br>of the document? If the document specifies protocol<br>extensions, are reservations requested in appropriate IANA<br>registries? Are the IANA registries clearly identified? If<br>the document creates a new registry, does it define the<br>proposed initial contents of the registry and an allocation<br>procedure for future registrations? Does it suggest a<br>reasonable name for the new registry? See [<a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC5226</a>]. If the<br>document describes an Expert Review process has Shepherd<br>conferred with the Responsible Area Director so that the IESG<br>can appoint the needed Expert during the IESG Evaluation?<br><br>The IANA considerations section exists.

The requirements identified in this document are related to<br>architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of a<br>Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for<br>the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential<br>applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the<br>support of multicast services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual<br>Private Multicast Service) as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private<br>Network working group.<br><br>This document is a product of the PWE3 working group.<br><br>This document is INFORMATIONAL.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>One of the major ongoing projects in the PWE3 working group is<br>extending pseudowires from just a simple point-to-point connection to<br>also supporting point-to-multipoint connections.
