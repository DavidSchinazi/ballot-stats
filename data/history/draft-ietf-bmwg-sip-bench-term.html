Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>All networking devices have a limited capacity to serve their<br>purpose. In some cases these limits can be ascertained by counting<br>physical features (e.g., interface card slots), but in other cases<br>standardized tests are required to be sure that all vendors count<br>their protocol-handling capacity in the same way, to avoid specmanship.<br>This draft addresses one such case, where the SIP session-serving <br>capacity of a device can only be discovered and rigorously compared<br>with other devices through isolated laboratory testing.<br><br>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session<br>-or-<br>This document describes the terminology for benchmarking Session<br>Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIP<br>benchmarking terminology document.&nbsp; The methodology and terminology<br>are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with<br>varying signaling and media load.&nbsp; Both scale and establishment rate<br>are measured by signaling plane performance.&nbsp; The SIP Devices to be<br>benchmarked may be a single device under test or a system under<br>test.&nbsp; Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different<br>types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, Session Border Controller,<br>and server paired with a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There were periods of intense and constructive feedback on this draft,<br>but also several pauses in progress during development. The most lively<br>discussions were prompted by presentation of actual test results using<br>the draft methods, which require significant time investment but are well-<br>worth the result. These drafts serve a useful purpose for the industry.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are existing implementations of the method, as noted above.<br><br>Dale Worley conducted an early review, following BMWG's request<br>of the RAI area.&nbsp; Dales's comments were addressed in version 05.<br>Henning Schulzrinne commented on the original work proposal.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Al Morton is Shepherd, Joel Jaeggli is Responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The shepherd has reviewed the drafts many times, and his comments are<br>in the BMWG archive. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No. Cross-area review has been obtained, however it impossible to get<br>the attention of everyone who considers themselves a SIP expert.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No concerns, this is still a valuable memo, as mentioned above.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>There are not outstanding IPR disclosures, according to the authors.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Although the comments and review intensity was highly variable,<br>it now appears that the WG is satisfied.&nbsp; <br>The first WGLC was completed on 5 April 2010 with comments.<br>The second WGLC was completed on 18 May 2012 with comments.<br>The third WGLC was completed on 10 Dec 2012 with comments, and the 1st Pub Request.<br>A IETF Last Call followed, and completed on 30 Jan 2013 with comments.<br>A fourth WGLC was completed 11 June 2014 with comments from expert review.<br>The current versions (11) address Dale Worley's RAI area early review<br>and Robert Spark's reviews.<br>The fifth WGLC completed quietly on July 14th, 2014.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>Nits are warnings requiring no action for these drafts.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The -term and -meth drafts are proceeding toward publication as a pair.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>No requests of IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>All networking devices have a limited capacity to serve their<br>purpose. In some cases these limits can be ascertained by counting<br>physical features (e.g., interface card slots), but in other cases<br>standard ized tests are required to be sure that all vendors count<br>their protocol-handling capacity in the same way, to avoid specmanship.<br>This draft addresses one such case, where the SIP session-serving <br>capacity of a device can only be discovered and rigorously compared<br>with other devices through isolated laboratory testing.<br><br>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session<br>-or-<br>This document describes the terminology for benchmarking Session<br>Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIP<br>benchmarking terminology document.&nbsp; The methodology and terminology<br>are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with<br>varying signaling and media load.&nbsp; Both scale and establishment rate<br>are measured by signaling plane performance.&nbsp; The SIP Devices to be<br>benchmarked may be a single device under test or a system under<br>test.&nbsp; Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different<br>types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, Session Border Controller,<br>and server paired with a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There were periods of intense and constructive feedback on this draft,<br>but also several pauses in progress during development. The most lively<br>discussions were prompted by presentation of actual test results using<br>the draft methods, which require significant time investment but are well-<br>worth the result.
