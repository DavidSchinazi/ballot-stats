This text should rather be in Section 4.<br><br>3) Traceroute with TTL expiring, will it require the 'expiring' LSR to check for capability discovery ? Or is it a 2-step procedure (discover the path, then ask for capabilities)?<br><br>4) Section 8, unclear to me where "Local Interface Index" is coming from... is it an opaque value for the initiator or does it have any semantic ? Same question applies to section 9 of course.<br><br>5) Section 10, in IPv6 any interface can have multiple IPv6 addresses, so, the text such as "or the interface address" is not applicable, suggestion "or any interface global address" (which can be ambiguous as well, perhaps the 'lowest' address ?)<br><br>NITS<br><br>N1) Section 3.1, "it can send an MPLS each request message" I cannot parse this part of the sentence<br><br>N2)Section 3.2, "When a responder LSR received" the use of past tense seems weird in this sentence, esp when present tense is use after.</div></td>

If so, then perhaps the moniker "LSR Capability" is overly<br>generic.<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Label switching over some member links of the LAG is successful,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but will be failed over other member links of the LAG.<br><br>nit: there's some verb tense inconsistency here; maybe "but fails over<br>other member links" would help.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines an optional TLV to discover the capabilities of<br>&nbsp;  a responder LSR and extensions for use with the MPLS LSP Ping and<br><br>nit: is it only the *responder* LSR we care about, or are there<br>potentially intermediaries in play?<br><br>&nbsp;  The solution consists of the MPLS echo request containing a DDMAP TLV<br>&nbsp;  and the optional LSR capability TLV to indicate that separate load<br><br>nit: Is this "optional capability TLV" the same "optional TLV" that we are<br>defining in this document?&nbsp; If so, calling it "the new optional LSR<br>capability" would aid clarity.&nbsp; (Also, we seem to use both the<br>"capability" and "Capability" capitzliations for describing this TLV.)<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  Capability TLV in the MPLS echo request message.&nbsp; When the responder<br>&nbsp;  LSR receives an MPLS echo request message with the LSR Capability TLV<br>&nbsp;  included, if it knows the LSR Capability TLV, then it MUST include<br>&nbsp;  the LSR Capability TLV in the MPLS echo reply message with the LSR<br>&nbsp;  Capability TLV describing features and extensions supported by the<br>&nbsp;  local LSR.&nbsp; Otherwise, an MPLS echo reply MUST be sent back to the<br>&nbsp;  initiator LSR with the return code set to "One or more of the TLVs<br>&nbsp;  was not understood".&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This last MUST seems like something that this document cannot mandate<br>(as it attempts to apply to non-implementations of this document); it<br>could only work if it was an existing requirement from the core MPLS<br>spec, in which case lower-case "must" is appropriate (possibly with<br>section reference).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the responder LSR does not understand the "LAG Description<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indicator flag":<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Clear both the "Downstream LAG Info Accommodation flag" and the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "Upstream LAG Info Accommodation flag".<br><br>Similarly, if an LSR does not understand a flag, it cannot give special<br>treatment to packets containing that flag.&nbsp; (Why an LSR would not<br>understand a flag defined in the same document that defines the<br>Capabilities TLV is beyond me, but you seem to want to allow for that<br>case.)<br><br>&nbsp;  If the responder does not know the LSR Capability TLV, an MPLS echo<br>&nbsp;  reply with the return code set to "One or more of the TLVs was not<br>&nbsp;  understood" MUST be sent back to the initiator LSR.<br><br>This duplicates the content I quoted at the top of this section's<br>comments.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the initiator LSR knows the capabilities that a responder<br>&nbsp;  supports, then it sends an MPLS echo request carrying a DDMAP with<br>&nbsp;  the "LAG Description Indicator flag" (G) set to the responder LSR.<br> <br>nit: I think the key point is not that the initiator knows the<br>capabilities of the peer, but rather that the initiator knows that the<br>peer supports this specific mechanism.<br>Also, is this "a DDMAP TLV"?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>Reading this makes it sound like the "LAG Description Indicator flag" is<br>completely orthogonal to regular DDMAP functionality, so that if I set<br>the LAG description indicator flag but do not otherwise request detailed<br>descriptions, only the LAG interfaces are returned.&nbsp; However, the flag<br>in question has to be inside a DDMAP TLV (and we should really say so,<br>perhaps as "[flag] set *in the DDMAP TLV*"!), so it seems like in practice<br>the LAG information can only be obtained in conjunction with full<br>detailed description information.&nbsp; (The specific suggestion here is to<br>note clearly that the flag is se in the DDMAP TLV.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; The responder LSR MUST include a DDMAP TLV when sending the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MPLS echo reply.<br><br>I got confused on my first pass through this section; adding "There is a<br>single DDMAP TLV for the LAG interface, with member links described<br>using sub-TLVs" here would have kept me from veering onto the wrong path.<br>(I thought there was going to be one DDMAP TLV per member link, plus one<br>for the LAG aggregate, with lots of duplication.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Based on the procedures described above, every LAG member link will<br>&nbsp;  have a Local Interface Index Sub-TLV and a Multipath Data Sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  entries in the DDMAP TLV.&nbsp; The order of the Sub-TLVs in the DDMAP TLV<br>&nbsp;  for a LAG member link MUST be Local Interface Index Sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  immediately followed by Multipath Data Sub-TLV.&nbsp; A LAG member link<br>&nbsp;  MAY also have a corresponding Remote Interface Index Sub-TLV.&nbsp; When a<br>&nbsp;  Local Interface Index Sub-TLV, a Remote Interface Index-Sub-TLV and a<br>&nbsp;  Multipath Data Sub-TLV are placed in the DDMAP TLV to describe a LAG<br>&nbsp;  member link, they MUST be placed in the order of Local Interface<br>&nbsp;  Index Sub-TLV, Remote Interface Index-Sub-TLV and Multipath Data Sub-<br>&nbsp;  TLV.<br><br>This last MUST contradicts the previous MUST.&nbsp; I suggest some more text<br>to clarify under which conditions each requirement applies.<br><br>I'd also suggest not using the figure for conveying a (apparent?) mandatory<br>requirement, and instead adding some text at the end: "The block of local<br>interface index, (optional remote interface index) and multipath data<br>sub-TLVs for each member link MUST appear adjacent to each other in<br>order of increasing local interface index."<br><br>It's confusing to label the multiplath data sub-TLV as "MANDATORY" when<br>the body text says "MUST add an [sic] Multipath data Sub-TLV [...] if<br>the received DDMAP TLV requested multipath information", i.e., it is not<br>always present, based on the contents of the echo request.<br><br>&nbsp;  When none of the received multipath information maps to a particular<br>&nbsp;  LAG member link, then the responder LSR MUST still place the Local<br>&nbsp;  Interface Index Sub-TLV and the Multipath Data Sub-TLV for that LAG<br>&nbsp;  member link in the DDMAP TLV, the value of Multipath Length field of<br>&nbsp;  the Multipath Data Sub-TLV is set to zero.<br><br>nit: the last comma is a comma splice.<br><br>Section 5.1.2<br><br>It seems like this places a slightly stronger burden on the responder<br>than stock 8029 does, in that there is a MUST-level requirement to act<br>on the 'I' flag in combination with the 'G' flag, whereas for the 'I'<br>flag alone 8029 only has a SHOULD-level requirement to respond<br>accordingly.&nbsp; We may want to call this out as a change in behavior.<br><br>Section 5.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Expectation is that there's a relationship between the interface<br>&nbsp;  index of the outgoing LAG member link at TTL=n and the interface<br>&nbsp;  index of the incoming LAG member link at TTL=n+1 for all discovered<br>&nbsp;  entropies.&nbsp; In other words, set of entropies that load balances to<br><br>nit: "The expectation"<br>nit: "discovered entropies" is a strange wording given how the entropy<br>label works; is this more like "all entropies examined"?<br><br><br>&nbsp;  The initiator LSR sends two MPLS echo request messages to traverse<br>&nbsp;  the two LAG member links at TTL=n+1:<br><br>How does the initiator know (which entropy label values?) to get the echo<br>requests to traverse different member links?<br><br>&nbsp;

 This document defines a new optional TLV which is referred to as the<br>&nbsp;  "LSR Capability TLV.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is this optional to use or comprehension-optional?&nbsp; (We elsewhere rely<br>on comprehension-mandatory behavior, so in the <a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC 8029</a> terminology this<br>seems to be a "mandatory TLV" even if it is not mandatory to use.)<br><br>&nbsp;

(I guess this is conventional for MPLS, though?&nbsp; So<br>maybe it's not a problem.)&nbsp; Just "Reserved" would be fine.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document defines two flags.&nbsp; The remaining flags MUST be set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to zero when sending and ignored on receipt.&nbsp; Both the U and the D<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flag MUST be cleared in the MPLS echo request message when<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sending, and ignored on receipt.&nbsp; Neither, either or both the U<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the D flag MAY be set in the MPLS echo reply message.<br><br>Similarly, I think we want to say "unallocated flags" rather than "the<br>remaining flags".<br><br>It also seems like the semantics being described here are "the TLV value<br>is ignored in the echo request and only has meaning in the response"<br>(i.e., this is a "tell me your capabilities" exchange, not a "here are<br>mine;

 The Detailed Interface and Label Stack TLV format is derived from the<br>&nbsp;  Interface and Label Stack TLV format (from [<a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC8029</a>]).&nbsp; Two changes<br>&nbsp;  are introduced.&nbsp; The first is that the label stack is converted into<br>&nbsp;  a sub-TLV.&nbsp; The second is that a new sub-TLV is added to describe an<br>&nbsp;  interface index.&nbsp; These fields of Detailed Interface and Label Stack<br>&nbsp;  TLV have the same use and meaning as in [<a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC8029</a>].&nbsp; A summary of<br>&nbsp;  these fields is as below:<br><br>nit: Are "These fields" just "The other fields"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Address Type indicates if the interface is numbered or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  unnumbered.&nbsp; It also determines the length of the IP Address<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and Interface fields.&nbsp; The resulting total length of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  initial part of the TLV is listed as "K Octets".&nbsp; The Address<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Type is set to one of the following values:<br><br>nit: is it better to list the currently allocated values or just refer<br>to the IANA registry?<br><br>I seee that this "index assigned to the interface" language for<br>unnumbered address types originates from <a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC 8029</a>, but both this<br>document and 8029 leave me confused as to the encoding used for this<br>index (for either/both IPv4 or IPv6 address types).<br><br>[My comment about "Must Be Zero" and allocatable bits also applies here]<br><br>Section 12<br><br>This document also adds a capability "negotiation" mechanism for MPLS<br>echo request/reply exchanges.&nbsp; As MPLS does not offer integrity<br>protection for its messages, this negotiation is only as trustworthy as<br>the network from which messages are accepted as valid, and initiators<br>have no recourse but to accept faithfully the echo replies received.<br><br>&nbsp;  To prevent leakage of vital information to untrusted users, a<br>&nbsp;  responder LSR MUST only accept MPLS echo request messages from<br>&nbsp;  designated trusted sources via filtering source IP address field of<br>&nbsp;  received MPLS echo request messages.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'd prefer to see a note added here about how "source IP address<br>filtering provides only a weak form of access control and is not, in<br>general, a reliable security mechanism.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is required<br>here in the absence of any more robust mechanism that might be used."<br><br>Section 13<br><br>Should we ask IANA to update the "Interface and Label Stack Address<br>Types" registry to also refer to this document, since we are sharing the<br>registry between the Interface and Label Stack TLV and the Detailed<br>version?<br><br>Section 13.2<br><br>The range 4-31743 spans two different allocation procedures (Standards<br>Action and Specification Required - Experimental RFC needed);

If so, then perhaps the moniker "LSR Capability" is overly<br>generic.<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Label switching over some member links of the LAG is successful,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but will be failed over other member links of the LAG.<br><br>nit: there's some verb tense inconsistency here; maybe "but fails over<br>other member links" would help.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines an optional TLV to discover the capabilities of<br>&nbsp;  a responder LSR and extensions for use with the MPLS LSP Ping and<br><br>nit: is it only the *responder* LSR we care about, or are there<br>potentially intermediaries in play?<br><br>&nbsp;  The solution consists of the MPLS echo request containing a DDMAP TLV<br>&nbsp;  and the optional LSR capability TLV to indicate that separate load<br><br>nit: Is this "optional capability TLV" the same "optional TLV" that we are<br>defining in this document?&nbsp; If so, calling it "the new optional LSR<br>capability" would aid clarity.&nbsp; (Also, we seem to use both the<br>"capability" and "Capability" capitzliations for describing this TLV.)<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  Capability TLV in the MPLS echo request message.&nbsp; When the responder<br>&nbsp;  LSR receives an MPLS echo request message with the LSR Capability TLV<br>&nbsp;  included, if it knows the LSR Capability TLV, then it MUST include<br>&nbsp;  the LSR Capability TLV in the MPLS echo reply message with the LSR<br>&nbsp;  Capability TLV describing features and extensions supported by the<br>&nbsp;  local LSR.&nbsp; Otherwise, an MPLS echo reply MUST be sent back to the<br>&nbsp;  initiator LSR with the return code set to "One or more of the TLVs<br>&nbsp;  was not understood".&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This last MUST seems like something that this document cannot mandate<br>(as it attempts to apply to non-implementations of this document); it<br>could only work if it was an existing requirement from the core MPLS<br>spec, in which case lower-case "must" is appropriate (possibly with<br>section reference).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the responder LSR does not understand the "LAG Description<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indicator flag":<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Clear both the "Downstream LAG Info Accommodation flag" and the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "Upstream LAG Info Accommodation flag".<br><br>Similarly, if an LSR does not understand a flag, it cannot give special<br>treatment to packets containing that flag.&nbsp; (Why an LSR would not<br>understand a flag defined in the same document that defines the<br>Capabilities TLV is beyond me, but you seem to want to allow for that<br>case.)<br><br>&nbsp;  If the responder does not know the LSR Capability TLV, an MPLS echo<br>&nbsp;  reply with the return code set to "One or more of the TLVs was not<br>&nbsp;  understood" MUST be sent back to the initiator LSR.<br><br>This duplicates the content I quoted at the top of this section's<br>comments.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the initiator LSR knows the capabilities that a responder<br>&nbsp;  supports, then it sends an MPLS echo request carrying a DDMAP with<br>&nbsp;  the "LAG Description Indicator flag" (G) set to the responder LSR.<br> <br>nit: I think the key point is not that the initiator knows the<br>capabilities of the peer, but rather that the initiator knows that the<br>peer supports this specific mechanism.<br>Also, is this "a DDMAP TLV"?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>Reading this makes it sound like the "LAG Description Indicator flag" is<br>completely orthogonal to regular DDMAP functionality, so that if I set<br>the LAG description indicator flag but do not otherwise request detailed<br>descriptions, only the LAG interfaces are returned.&nbsp; However, the flag<br>in question has to be inside a DDMAP TLV (and we should really say so,<br>perhaps as "[flag] set *in the DDMAP TLV*"!), so it seems like in practice<br>the LAG information can only be obtained in conjunction with full<br>detailed description information.&nbsp; (The specific suggestion here is to<br>note clearly that the flag is se in the DDMAP TLV.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; The responder LSR MUST include a DDMAP TLV when sending the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  MPLS echo reply.<br><br>I got confused on my first pass through this section; adding "There is a<br>single DDMAP TLV for the LAG interface, with member links described<br>using sub-TLVs" here would have kept me from veering onto the wrong path.<br>(I thought there was going to be one DDMAP TLV per member link, plus one<br>for the LAG aggregate, with lots of duplication.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Based on the procedures described above, every LAG member link will<br>&nbsp;  have a Local Interface Index Sub-TLV and a Multipath Data Sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  entries in the DDMAP TLV.&nbsp; The order of the Sub-TLVs in the DDMAP TLV<br>&nbsp;  for a LAG member link MUST be Local Interface Index Sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  immediately followed by Multipath Data Sub-TLV.&nbsp; A LAG member link<br>&nbsp;  MAY also have a corresponding Remote Interface Index Sub-TLV.&nbsp; When a<br>&nbsp;  Local Interface Index Sub-TLV, a Remote Interface Index-Sub-TLV and a<br>&nbsp;  Multipath Data Sub-TLV are placed in the DDMAP TLV to describe a LAG<br>&nbsp;  member link, they MUST be placed in the order of Local Interface<br>&nbsp;  Index Sub-TLV, Remote Interface Index-Sub-TLV and Multipath Data Sub-<br>&nbsp;  TLV.<br><br>This last MUST contradicts the previous MUST.&nbsp; I suggest some more text<br>to clarify under which conditions each requirement applies.<br><br>I'd also suggest not using the figure for conveying a (apparent?) mandatory<br>requirement, and instead adding some text at the end: "The block of local<br>interface index, (optional remote interface index) and multipath data<br>sub-TLVs for each member link MUST appear adjacent to each other in<br>order of increasing local interface index."<br><br>It's confusing to label the multiplath data sub-TLV as "MANDATORY" when<br>the body text says "MUST add an [sic] Multipath data Sub-TLV [...] if<br>the received DDMAP TLV requested multipath information", i.e., it is not<br>always present, based on the contents of the echo request.<br><br>&nbsp;  When none of the received multipath information maps to a particular<br>&nbsp;  LAG member link, then the responder LSR MUST still place the Local<br>&nbsp;  Interface Index Sub-TLV and the Multipath Data Sub-TLV for that LAG<br>&nbsp;  member link in the DDMAP TLV, the value of Multipath Length field of<br>&nbsp;  the Multipath Data Sub-TLV is set to zero.<br><br>nit: the last comma is a comma splice.<br><br>Section 5.1.2<br><br>It seems like this places a slightly stronger burden on the responder<br>than stock 8029 does, in that there is a MUST-level requirement to act<br>on the 'I' flag in combination with the 'G' flag, whereas for the 'I'<br>flag alone 8029 only has a SHOULD-level requirement to respond<br>accordingly.&nbsp; We may want to call this out as a change in behavior.<br><br>Section 5.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Expectation is that there's a relationship between the interface<br>&nbsp;  index of the outgoing LAG member link at TTL=n and the interface<br>&nbsp;  index of the incoming LAG member link at TTL=n+1 for all discovered<br>&nbsp;  entropies.&nbsp; In other words, set of entropies that load balances to<br><br>nit: "The expectation"<br>nit: "discovered entropies" is a strange wording given how the entropy<br>label works; is this more like "all entropies examined"?<br><br><br>&nbsp;  The initiator LSR sends two MPLS echo request messages to traverse<br>&nbsp;  the two LAG member links at TTL=n+1:<br><br>How does the initiator know (which entropy label values?) to get the echo<br>requests to traverse different member links?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Error case:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; One MPLS echo request message reaches TTL=n+1 on an LAG member<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  link 1.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; The other MPLS echo request message also reaches TTL=n+1 on an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  LAG member link 1.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One or two MPLS echo request messages sent by the initiator LSR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cannot reach the immediate downstream LSR, or the two MPLS echo<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request messages reach at the immediate downstream LSR from the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same LAG member link.<br><br>The description paragraph doesn't seem to match up the scenario<br>described in the sub-bullets, which leaves me confused as to what<br>scenario(s) are intended to be considered as the "error case".<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines a new optional TLV which is referred to as the<br>&nbsp;  "LSR Capability TLV.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is this optional to use or comprehension-optional?&nbsp; (We elsewhere rely<br>on comprehension-mandatory behavior, so in the <a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC 8029</a> terminology this<br>seems to be a "mandatory TLV" even if it is not mandatory to use.)<br><br>&nbsp;

Neither, either or both the U<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the D flag MAY be set in the MPLS echo reply message.<br><br>Similarly, I think we want to say "unallocated flags" rather than "the<br>remaining flags".<br><br>It also seems like the semantics being described here are "the TLV value<br>is ignored in the echo request and only has meaning in the response"<br>(i.e., this is a "tell me your capabilities" exchange, not a "here are<br>mine; what are yours?" exchange).&nbsp; As written, that applies only to the<br>U and D bits, and is not a general property.&nbsp; That may well be a fine<br>choice if we think we might want the two-way exchange for some future<br>allocated bit, but if we do think it's a general property of the<br>mechanism, I'd suggest rewording the text.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>(Per IANA, bits 4 and 5 are already assigned but are not reflected in the<br>diagram.)<br><br>Section 10<br><br>&nbsp;  The Detailed Interface and Label Stack TLV format is derived from the<br>&nbsp;  Interface and Label Stack TLV format (from [<a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC8029</a>]).&nbsp; Two changes<br>&nbsp;  are introduced.&nbsp; The first is that the label stack is converted into<br>&nbsp;  a sub-TLV.&nbsp; The second is that a new sub-TLV is added to describe an<br>&nbsp;  interface index.&nbsp; These fields of Detailed Interface and Label Stack<br>&nbsp;  TLV have the same use and meaning as in [<a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC8029</a>].&nbsp; A summary of<br>&nbsp;  these fields is as below:<br><br>nit: Are "These fields" just "The other fields"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Address Type indicates if the interface is numbered or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  unnumbered.&nbsp; It also determines the length of the IP Address<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and Interface fields.&nbsp; The resulting total length of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  initial part of the TLV is listed as "K Octets".&nbsp; The Address<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Type is set to one of the following values:<br><br>nit: is it better to list the currently allocated values or just refer<br>to the IANA registry?<br><br>I seee that this "index assigned to the interface" language for<br>unnumbered address types originates from <a href="/doc/rfc8029/">RFC 8029</a>, but both this<br>document and 8029 leave me confused as to the encoding used for this<br>index (for either/both IPv4 or IPv6 address types).<br><br>[My comment about "Must Be Zero" and allocatable bits also applies here]<br><br>Section 12<br><br>This document also adds a capability "negotiation" mechanism for MPLS<br>echo request/reply exchanges.&nbsp; As MPLS does not offer integrity<br>protection for its messages, this negotiation is only as trustworthy as<br>the network from which messages are accepted as valid, and initiators<br>have no recourse but to accept faithfully the echo replies received.<br><br>&nbsp;  To prevent leakage of vital information to untrusted users, a<br>&nbsp;  responder LSR MUST only accept MPLS echo request messages from<br>&nbsp;  designated trusted sources via filtering source IP address field of<br>&nbsp;  received MPLS echo request messages.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'd prefer to see a note added here about how "source IP address<br>filtering provides only a weak form of access control and is not, in<br>general, a reliable security mechanism.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is required<br>here in the absence of any more robust mechanism that might be used."<br><br>Section 13<br><br>Should we ask IANA to update the "Interface and Label Stack Address<br>Types" registry to also refer to this document, since we are sharing the<br>registry between the Interface and Label Stack TLV and the Detailed<br>version?<br><br>Section 13.2<br><br>The range 4-31743 spans two different allocation procedures (Standards<br>Action and Specification Required - Experimental RFC needed); I assume<br>that we want the 4-16383 range for Standards Action - mandatory TLVs.<br><br>Section 13.4<br><br>We don't say what range we want this to be allocated from -- I assume<br>4-16383 since this is a negotiated feature and sending it outside the<br>negotiated scenario should be an error.<br><br>Section 13.4.1<br><br>(I note that some existing sub-TLV registries have "Experimental RFC<br>required" for the experimental ranges, but that is arguably more<br>stringent than necessary; Specification Required seems more appropriate<br>for this case.)<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>I was kind of hoping for some more guidance on what an initiator could<br>do in these scenarios to try to get better visibility into the switch<br>behavior (and, hopefully, a workaround to get reliable echo responses<br>that cover all LAG member links).&nbsp; AFAICT there's not a better option<br>than "try a bunch of entropy labels and see what responses you can get<br>back" and that's the same remedy in all the described topologies, but it<br>would be nice to have this stated explicitly for the reader.<br><br>Section A.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the worst case, MPLS echo request messages with<br>&nbsp;  specific entropies to exercise every LAG members from R1 to S1 can<br>&nbsp;  all reach R2 via same LAG member.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm confused by the phrase "specific entropies to exercise every LAG<br>members [sic] from R1 to S1" -- is there some deterministic algorithm by<br>which a specific entropy label value will force a specific LAG member<br>link?&nbsp; My understanding was that the entropy was used as input to an<br>opaque hash function and that trial-and-error was the only way to<br>explore the mapping from entropy value to LAG member link taken.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents.

At one point <br>&nbsp; in time the wg chairs thought the document would be abandonned, but<br>&nbsp; when we solicitited the interest for progressing the document we <br>&nbsp; found quite a bit of interest.<br>&nbsp; The working group chairs then appointed an editor and the progress <br>&nbsp; has been smooth after that. However, as a result the document has now <br>&nbsp; six authors. The authors, wg chairs and the working group are <br>&nbsp; comfortable with 6 authors.<br><br>&nbsp; There were two working group last calls. The second one was issued<br>&nbsp; because there was a long time between the first and the point in <br>&nbsp; time when all comments were addressed.<br><br>&nbsp; There is a solid support for this document within the working group.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Yes we know of implementations of this protocol.<br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Loa ANdersson is the Document Shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Deborah Brungard is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd reviewed the document when it was first<br>&nbsp;  posted, as part of the working group adoption process and when <br>&nbsp;  preparing the two wglcs.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp;  This document was initiated because operational problems were<br>&nbsp;  found in deployed networks. The working groups agreed that this<br>&nbsp;  problem had to be resolved and is fully behind the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document passes the nits-tool clean, manual checks have not <br>&nbsp;  revealed any other nits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No formal review necessary.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes all the references are correctly split in normative and informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No, all normative references are to existing RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document will not change any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The Shepherd has reviewed that IANA section and IANA allocation<br>&nbsp;  requests several times.
