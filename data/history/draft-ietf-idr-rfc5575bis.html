 becomes necessary to enforce it for security reasons.<br><br>nit: missing word (e.g., "necessary to enforce it here" or "necessary to<br>enforce it in processing flow specifications").<br><br>&nbsp;  The best-match unicast route may change over the time independently<br>&nbsp;  of the Flow Specification NLRI.&nbsp; Therefore, a revalidation of the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification NLRI MUST be performed whenever unicast routes<br>&nbsp;  change.&nbsp; Revalidation is defined as retesting that clause a and<br>&nbsp;  clause b above are true.<br><br>IMPORTANT: Why does clause c not need to be retested?<br><br>&nbsp;  The neighboring AS is the immediate destination of the traffic<br>&nbsp;  described by the Flow Specification.&nbsp; If it requests these flows to<br>&nbsp;  be dropped, that request can be honored without concern that it<br>&nbsp;  represents a denial of service in itself.&nbsp; Supposedly, the traffic is<br>&nbsp;  being dropped by the downstream autonomous system, and there is no<br>&nbsp;  added value in carrying the traffic to it.<br><br>(This presumes that there is some integrity protection applied to the<br>received data, which might be worth making more explicit.)<br>Also, nit: I'd suggest s/Supposedly,/The reasoning is that this is as if/<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Please be consistent about "ASN" vs. "AS" in Table 2.<br><br>Should the "traffic-action" and "traffic-marking" actions list the encoded<br>length for the reader's convenience?<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This draft includes numerous editorial changes which clarifies the unclear specifications in <a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC5575</a>. There were questions/discussion about the precedence order and combination of numeric operators, which have been resolved. There were also some discussions about the validation of flowspec components, which has been resolved as well. A later discussion is about whether and how existing implementations are complied with the suggested behavior in this -bis document. There were several options under consideration, and consensus was reached on the option chosen in the current version .<br><br>After WGLC had completed and shortly after the document was submitted for publication, an implementor brought forward a remaining bug in the specification. The chair (John) thought it seriously enough to bring the document back to the WG for further consideration. The bug was fixed and a subsequent WGLC held to cover the change.

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This draft clarifies the unclear specifications in <a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC5575</a> and provide the clear rules for actions which interfere with each other. There were questions/discussion about the precedence order and combination of numeric operators, which have been resolved. There were also some discussions about the validation of flowspec components, which has been resolved as well. Recent discussion is about whether and how existing implementations are complied with the suggested behavior in this -bis document. There were several options under consideration, and consensus was reached on the option chosen in the current version .<br><br>After WGLC had completed and shortly after the document was submitted for publication, an implementor brought forward a remaining bug in the specification. The chair (John) thought it seriously enough to bring the document back to the WG for further consideration. The bug was fixed and a subsequent WGLC held to cover the change.

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This draft clarifies the unclear specifications in <a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC5575</a> and provide the clear rules for actions which interfere with each other. There were questions/discussion about the precedence order and combination of numeric operators, which have been resolved. There were also some discussions about the validation of flowspec components, which has been resolved as well. Recent discussion is about whether and how existing implementations are complied with the suggested behavior in this -bis document. There were several options under consideration, and consensus was reached on the option chosen in the current version .<br><br>After WGLC had completed and shortly after the document was submitted for publication, an implementor brought forward a remaining bug in the specification. The chair (John) thought it seriously enough to bring the document back to the WG for further consideration. The bug was fixed and a subsequent WGLC held to cover the change.

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>This draft clarifies the unclear specifications in <a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC5575</a> and provide the clear rules for actions which interfere with each other. There were questions/discussion about the precedence order and combination of numeric operators, which have been resolved. There were also some discussions about the validation of flowspec components, which has been resolved as well.

There were questions/discussion about the precedence order and combination of numeric operators, which have been resolved. There were also some discussions about the validation of flowspec components, which has been resolved as well. Recent discussion is about whether and how existing implementations are complied with the suggested behavior in this -bis document. Currently there are several options under consideration, hopefully this will be solved in next revision.<br>&nbsp; <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC 5575</a> has been widely implemented. <br>Depends on the solution chosen for the interfering actions, This document may require some modification to the existing <a href="/doc/rfc5575/">RFC 5575</a> implementation.
