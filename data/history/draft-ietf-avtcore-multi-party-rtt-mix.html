Should that be reflected in the<br>document?<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  mixer model.&nbsp; The possibility to implement the solution in a wide<br>&nbsp;  range of existing RTP implementations made the RTP-mixer model be<br>&nbsp;  selected to be fully specified in this document.<br><br>It's a little surprising to see this claim given the absence (per the<br>shepherd writeup) of any actual implementations.<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Multiple sources per packet<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A new "text" media subtype would be specified with up to 15<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sources in each packet.&nbsp; The mechanism would make use of the RTP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mixer model specified in RTP [<a href="/doc/rfc3550/">RFC3550</a>].&nbsp; Text from up to 15<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sources can be included in each packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(How was the "15" number determined?)<br><br>Section 2.3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A party receiving an offer containing the "rtt-mixer" SDP attribute<br>&nbsp;  and being willing to use the RTP-mixer-based method of this<br>&nbsp;  specification for sending or receiving or both sending and receiving<br>&nbsp;  SHALL include the "rtt-mixer" SDP attribute in the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  "text" media section in the answer.<br><br>This requirement doesn't quite seem to match up with what I expect -- an<br>answerer that's willing to use rtt-mixer and also willing to use<br>something else seems to still be bound by the "SHALL include" in the<br>first paragraph, which makes the willingness to use something else a bit<br>irrelevant and precludes choosing the other option.&nbsp; Perhaps we want to<br>say only "chooses to use the RTP-mixer-based method of this<br>specification"?<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>What purpose does the initial BOM serve?&nbsp; I note that, e.g., <a href="/doc/rfc5198/">RFC 5198</a><br>has an explicit BOM "MUST NOT appear at the beginning of these text<br>strings" and that <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> specifies UTF-8 encoding of the text.<br>I see in Section 3.17.4 (and 4.2.1) we mention that it might be used for<br>keepalive, but in rtt-mix don't we have lots of non-BOM keepalive<br>options?<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp;  If the "CPS" value is reached, longer transmission intervals SHALL be<br>&nbsp;  applied and only as much of the text queued for transmission SHALL be<br>&nbsp;  sent at the end of each transmission interval that can be allowed<br>&nbsp;  without exceeding the "CPS" value, until the transmission rate falls<br>&nbsp;  under the "CPS" value again.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This doesn't seem as precisely specified as it could be, given that the<br>CPS rate is supposed to be enforced over "any 10-second interval".&nbsp; As<br>written, this seems to suggest that the entire 10-second history of<br>packet size/spacing needs to be retained, so that at each transmission<br>the earliest time for next transmission can be computed that retains the<br>CPS limit.&nbsp; It's not clear that there's real need for such a complicated<br>solution vs something that more bluntly backs off the transmit rate and<br>uses bucketed averages for tracking the transmission rate.<br><br>(I have no idea why it's 330ms for a mixer and 300ms for a non-mixer,<br>but assume there is some reason for the difference.)<br><br>Section 3.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Text received by a mixer from a participant SHOULD NOT be included in<br>&nbsp;  transmission from the mixer to that participant, because the normal<br>&nbsp;  behavior of the endpoint is to present locally-produced text locally.<br><br>When would the SHOULD NOT be ignored?&nbsp; (How might a mixer know that the<br>other endpoint is not using the "normal behavior" of presenting<br>locally-produced text locally?)<br><br>Section 3.7<br><br>&nbsp;  A mixer SHALL handle reception, recovery from packet loss, deletion<br>&nbsp;  of superfluous redundancy, marking of possible text loss and deletion<br>&nbsp;  of 'BOM' characters from each participant before queueing received<br>&nbsp;  text for transmission to receiving participants.<br><br>Are there specific references available for each of these operations?<br><br>Section 3.9<br><br>&nbsp;  The source with the oldest text received in the mixer or oldest<br>&nbsp;  redundant text SHALL be next in turn to get all its available unsent<br>&nbsp;  text transmitted.&nbsp; Any redundant repetitions of earlier transmitted<br><br>Just to confirm: this is really *all* its available unsent text, not<br>just however much will fit in one packet/flight/etc.?&nbsp; Can a participant<br>"hog the mic" by continuing to append to that list even as transmission<br>has commenced?<br><br>Section 3.13<br><br>It took me a bit of searching to realize that it is <a href="/doc/rfc2198/">RFC 2198</a> that<br>specifies the additional header that includes the "timestamp offset"<br>field.&nbsp; A specific reference here (or maybe from an earlier section?)<br>would have helped me out.<br><br>Section 3.14<br><br>&nbsp;  The SSRC of the mixer for the RTT session SHALL be inserted in the<br>&nbsp;  SSRC field of the RTP header.<br><br>As written, this could be taken to say that the non-mixer endpoint<br>should also use the SSRC of the mixer.<br><br>Section 3.16<br><br>&nbsp;  Confidentiality SHALL be considered when composing these fields.<br><br>I think "privacy considerations" would be more relevant than<br>"confidentiality".<br><br>&nbsp;  Similar considerations SHALL be taken as for other media.<br><br>This seems rather vague and it's not really clear how the implementor is<br>supposed to take action based on it.&nbsp; (Note that media are typically<br>straight over (S)RTP, but these reports are (S)RTCP, which admittedly is<br>also over (S)RTP, but is still different.)<br><br>Section 3.17.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If it is known that only one source is active in the RTP session,<br>&nbsp;  then it is likely that a gap equal to or larger than the agreed<br>&nbsp;  number of redundancy generations (including the primary) causes text<br>&nbsp;  loss.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Some more care in description may be needed here, as the gap in RTP<br>sequence numbers is measured in the RTP sequence units (e.g., time), but <br>the redundancy generation number is just a dimensionless generation<br>count.&nbsp; We need to assume the max inter-packet spacing in order to<br>convert that into a time value that is suitable for assuming loss.<br><br>&nbsp;  evaluate if three or more packets were lost within one second.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  this simple method is used, then a t140block SHOULD be created with a<br>&nbsp;  marker for possible text loss [T140ad1] and associated with the SSRC<br>&nbsp;  of the transmitter as a general input from the mixer.<br><br>Does "input from the mixer" mean that it uses the mixer's SSRC value?<br>Or is this injected by the mixer (in contrast to the previous paragraph,<br>where it was the receiver that injects the marker for possible text<br>loss)?<br><br>Section 3.17.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If the packet is not the first packet from a source, then if the<br>&nbsp;  second generation redundant data is available, its timestamp SHALL be<br>&nbsp;  created by subtracting its timestamp offset from the RTP timestamp.<br>&nbsp;  If the resulting timestamp is later than the latest retrieved data<br>&nbsp;  from the same source, then the redundant data SHALL be retrieved and<br>&nbsp;  appended to the receive buffer.&nbsp; The process SHALL be continued in<br>&nbsp;  the same way for the first generation redundant data.&nbsp; After that,<br>&nbsp;  the primary data SHALL be retrieved from the packet and appended to<br>&nbsp;  the receive buffer for the source.<br><br>I think I can come up with reordering scenarios that cause this<br>procedure to discard data that would otherwise have recovered from loss.<br><br>Also, this procedure as written says that the primary data shall always<br>be appended to the receive buffer (with no time check), which could<br>result in doubled content in the case of reordering.<br><br>Section 3.19<br><br>&nbsp;  Security SHOULD be applied when possible regarding the capabilities<br>&nbsp;  of the participating devices by use of SIP over TLS by default<br><br>"Security" is not some all-encompassing attribute that can be<br>generically applied; there are specific security properties that may or<br>may not be achieved by any given mechanism, and it's generally worth<br>being precise about what properties are (or are not) achieved.&nbsp; So here<br>we might say "security mechanisms to provide confidentiality and<br>integrity protection and peer authentication SHOULD be applied".&nbsp; We<br>cannot in general achieve source authenticity with just SRTP when a<br>mixer is involved, though <a href="/doc/rfc8723/">RFC 8723</a> does specify a double-encryption<br>mechanism that applies in some cases when there is a central media<br>distributor.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In<br>&nbsp;  applications where legacy endpoints without security may exist, a<br>&nbsp;  negotiation SHOULD be performed to decide if encryption on the media<br>&nbsp;  level will be applied.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>How would endpoints know if legacy endpoints might exist?<br><br>How would this negotiation be performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  security levels.&nbsp; The mixing for conference-unaware endpoints has<br>&nbsp;  lower security level than the mixing method for conference-aware<br>&nbsp;  endpoints, because there may be an opportunity for a malicious mixer<br>&nbsp;  or a middleman to masquerade the source labels accompanying the text<br>&nbsp;  streams in text format.&nbsp; This is especially true if support of un-<br>&nbsp;  encrypted SIP and media is supported because of lack of such support<br>&nbsp;  in the target endpoints.&nbsp; However, the mixing for conference-aware<br>&nbsp;  endpoints as specified here also requires that the mixer can be<br>&nbsp;  trusted.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As the last sentence indicates, the provided reasoning in the first<br>sentence is not really accurate, since the mixer could just as easily<br>adjust the CSRC value in the header as change the label in the in-band<br>text stream.&nbsp; This does not inherently invalidate the claim that there<br>are different security levels, though, as the correct behavior of the<br>mixer seems easier to independently validate in the conference-aware<br>endpoint case (with the well-formed RTP payloads providing information<br>that can be validated out-of-band with other participants).&nbsp; But I don't<br>think this description should be left in the document as-is; it doesn't<br>seem accurate.<br><br>In the case of unencrypted media, it does seem technically true that it<br>is easier for a non-mixer middleman to masquerade the source labels,<br>since in that case it only adjusts the payload directly without needing<br>to keep state on the RTP sender information and produce well-formed RTP<br>headers after its adjustment.&nbsp; But this is only a modest level of<br>additional difficulty and does not reflect any kind of effective<br>security control, so it may not be worth mentioning at all.<br><br>&nbsp;  End-to-end encryption would require further work and could be based<br>&nbsp;  on WebRTC as specified in Section 1.2.<br><br>Is <a href="/doc/rfc8723/">RFC 8723</a> not applicable to these scenarios at all?&nbsp; I do not think it<br>is WebRTC-specific.<br><br>Section 3.21<br><br>&nbsp;

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are no existing implementations of the specification.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd is Bernard Aboba. Responsible AD is Barry Leiba. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document and provided comments here: <br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/</a><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The specification has not been implemented yet, so it is possible that issues could arise in implementation. This is more of a concern than for typical AVTCORE documents, since this specification is likely to become a regulatory requirement prior to advancing beyond Proposed Standard. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document does not raise any unique security, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML or internationalization issues.<br>Since there are no implementations yet, it is possible that operational complexity concerns will arise that have not been forseen. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>During review, the question was raised as to whether the specification will require development of an RTT mixer, or whether it could be made compatible with existing conferencing servers implementing Selective Forwarding. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix</a><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The document has been reviewed by people knowledgeable about emergency services and the role of Realtime Text within those services. <br>It has also had some review from implementers of general communication services. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Emergency call use of <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> "RTP Payload for Text Conversation"<br>&nbsp;  requires multi-party mixing.&nbsp; Real-time text mixers for multi-party<br>&nbsp;  sessions need to identify the source of each transmitted group of<br>&nbsp;  text so that the text can be presented by endpoints in suitable<br>&nbsp;  grouping with other text from the same source, while new text from<br>&nbsp;  other sources is also presented in readable grouping as received<br>&nbsp;  interleaved in real-time.<br><br>&nbsp;  Enhancements for <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> real-time text mixing are provided in this<br>&nbsp;  document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables<br>&nbsp;  source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text<br>&nbsp;  from different sources.&nbsp; The intended use is for real-time text<br>&nbsp;  mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient<br>&nbsp;  presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text<br>&nbsp;  session.&nbsp; The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the<br>&nbsp;  CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.&nbsp; The method<br>&nbsp;  makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-<br>&nbsp;  party sessions.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>WG Last Call of "RTP-mixer formatting of multi-party Real-time text" was<br>announced on November 25, 2020:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/</a><br><br>WGLC concluded on December 9, 2020.<br><br>Of the 6 participants responding to the WGLC, 3 supported Advancement to<br>Proposed Standard, and 3 respondents provided comments, which were addressed<br>by the author. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are no existing implementations of the specification.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd is Bernard Aboba. Responsible AD is Barry Leiba. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document and provided comments here: <br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/</a><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The specification has not been implemented yet, so it is possible that issues could arise in implementation. This is more of a concern than for typical AVTCORE documents, since this specification is likely to become a regulatory requirement prior to advancing beyond Proposed Standard. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document does not raise any unique security, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML or internationalization issues.<br>Since there are no implementations yet, it is possible that operational complexity concerns will arise that have not been forseen. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>During review, the question was raised as to whether the specification will require development of an RTT mixer, or whether it could be made compatible with existing conferencing servers implementing Selective Forwarding. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix</a><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The document has been reviewed by people knowledgeable about emergency services and the role of Realtime Text within those services. <br>It has also had some review from implementers of general communication services. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No appeal threats or extreme discontent expressed.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Emergency call use of <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> "RTP Payload for Text Conversation"<br>&nbsp;  requires multi-party mixing.&nbsp; Real-time text mixers for multi-party<br>&nbsp;  sessions need to identify the source of each transmitted group of<br>&nbsp;  text so that the text can be presented by endpoints in suitable<br>&nbsp;  grouping with other text from the same source, while new text from<br>&nbsp;  other sources is also presented in readable grouping as received<br>&nbsp;  interleaved in real-time.<br><br>&nbsp;  Enhancements for <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> real-time text mixing are provided in this<br>&nbsp;  document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables<br>&nbsp;  source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text<br>&nbsp;  from different sources.&nbsp; The intended use is for real-time text<br>&nbsp;  mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient<br>&nbsp;  presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text<br>&nbsp;  session.&nbsp; The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the<br>&nbsp;  CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.&nbsp; The method<br>&nbsp;  makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-<br>&nbsp;  party sessions.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>WG Last Call of "RTP-mixer formatting of multi-party Real-time text" was<br>announced on November 25, 2020:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/</a><br><br>WGLC concluded on December 9, 2020.<br><br>Of the 6 participants responding to the WGLC, 3 supported Advancement to<br>Proposed Standard, and 3 respondents provided comments, which were addressed<br>by the author. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are no existing implementations of the specification.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd is Bernard Aboba. Responsible AD is Barry Leiba. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document and provided comments here: <br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/</a><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The specification has not been implemented yet, so it is possible that issues could arise in implementation. This is more of a concern than for typical AVTCORE documents, since this specification is likely to become a regulatory requirement prior to advancing beyond Proposed Standard. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document does not raise any unique security, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML or internationalization issues.<br>Since there are no implementations yet, it is possible that operational complexity concerns will arise that have not been forseen. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>During review, the question was raised as to whether the specification will require development of an RTT mixer, or whether it could be made compatible with existing conferencing servers implementing Selective Forwarding. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix</a><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The document has been reviewed by people knowledgeable about emergency services and the role of Realtime Text within those services. <br>It has also had some review from implementers of general communication services. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No appeal threats or extreme discontent expressed.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>Section 10.1 of the document requests registration of the "rtt-mixer" sdp media attribute.&nbsp; There are no other IANA actions requested.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Emergency call use of <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> "RTP Payload for Text Conversation"<br>&nbsp;  requires multi-party mixing.&nbsp; Real-time text mixers for multi-party<br>&nbsp;  sessions need to identify the source of each transmitted group of<br>&nbsp;  text so that the text can be presented by endpoints in suitable<br>&nbsp;  grouping with other text from the same source, while new text from<br>&nbsp;  other sources is also presented in readable grouping as received<br>&nbsp;  interleaved in real-time.<br><br>&nbsp;  Enhancements for <a href="/doc/rfc4103/">RFC 4103</a> real-time text mixing are provided in this<br>&nbsp;  document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables<br>&nbsp;  source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text<br>&nbsp;  from different sources.&nbsp; The intended use is for real-time text<br>&nbsp;  mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient<br>&nbsp;  presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text<br>&nbsp;  session.&nbsp; The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the<br>&nbsp;  CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.&nbsp; The method<br>&nbsp;  makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-<br>&nbsp;  party sessions.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>WG Last Call of "RTP-mixer formatting of multi-party Real-time text" was<br>announced on November 25, 2020:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/tjGlWlXL5a54nhgl5nRV3jkD_tk/</a><br><br>WGLC concluded on December 9, 2020.<br><br>Of the 6 participants responding to the WGLC, 3 supported Advancement to<br>Proposed Standard, and 3 respondents provided comments, which were addressed<br>by the author. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>As far as I know, there are no existing implementations of the specification.&nbsp; <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd is Bernard Aboba. Responsible AD is Barry Leiba. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document and provided comments here: <br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/WJ5Yb5Qm-LrQXcIYxaOeLZD1i-c/</a><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>As far as I know, the specification has not been implemented yet, so it is possible that issues could arise in implementation. This is more of a concern than for typical AVTCORE documents, since this specification is likely to become a regulatory requirement prior to advancing beyond Proposed Standard. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The SDP section of the document needs to be reviewed by the SDP Directorate.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>During review, the question was raised as to whether the specification will require development of an RTT mixer, or whether it could be made compatible with<br>existing conferencing servers implementing Selective Forwarding. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR disclosures: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?submit=draft&amp;id=draft-ietf-avtcore-multi-party-rtt-mix</a><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The document has been reviewed by people knowledgeable about emergency services and the role of Realtime Text within those services. <br>It has also had some review from implementers of general communication services. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No appeal threats or extreme discontent expressed.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are some ID nits.
