I am happy to include both in the same document, but the specification of the protocol mechanisms falls short and results in a document that lacks clarity.&nbsp; While YANG is the preferred management mechanism, it should be possible to implement and manage the feature without the model.<br><br>Most of my concerns are from Section 2 (line numbers from idnits):<br><br><br>154	&nbsp;

The point here is that this document's specification part is incomplete because it doesn't specify which parameters "SHOULD be configurable".<br><br><br>(B) The YANG model offers global and per-interface configuration options.&nbsp; The specification doesn't discuss hierarchical configuration or whether one type should take precedence over the other.&nbsp; [Related to Rob's DISCUSS.]<br><br>This point was discussed on the mailing list, where it was pointed out that per-interface configuration should override global configuration [1], but that discussion is not reflected in the document.<br><br>[1] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rtg-bfd/GI_eNtxcEeh2_vTl9zfq7K6V1X4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rtg-bfd/GI_eNtxcEeh2_vTl9zfq7K6V1X4</a><br><br><br>171	&nbsp;

The<br>174	&nbsp;  source address of the BFD Control packet SHOULD be validated against<br>175	&nbsp;  expected routing protocol peer addresses on that interface.<br><br>(C) "SHOULD be validated" <br><br>What does validating the source address "against expected routing protocol peer addresses on that interface" entail?&nbsp;

Where does this "expected" list come from?&nbsp; On a LAN, it seems like any address would be valid since a router doesn't know the list of IGP neighbors beforehand.<br><br><br>177	&nbsp;  The passive side MUST then start sending BFD Control packets and<br>178	&nbsp;  perform the necessary procedure for bringing up, maintaining and<br>179	&nbsp;  tearing down the BFD session.&nbsp; If the BFD session fails to get<br>180	&nbsp;  established within certain specified time, or if an established BFD<br>181	&nbsp;  session goes down, the passive side SHOULD stop sending BFD Control<br>182	&nbsp;  packets and MAY delete the BFD session created until BFD Control<br>183	&nbsp;  packets are initiated by the active side again.<br><br>(D) "If the BFD session fails to get established within certain specified time..."<br><br>[nit] s/within certain specified time/within a certain specified time<br><br>Where does a "certain specified time" come from?&nbsp;

 the exchange of BFD discriminators over an out-of-band channel before<br>140	&nbsp;  BFD session bring-up.<br><br>Given that this proposal claims to be better (or at least simpler) than S-BFD, what should an operator consider when deciding which to use?&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; with "TTL=255" [<a href="/doc/rfc5082/">RFC5082</a>].<br><br>GTSM is already required in <a href="/doc/rfc5880/">rfc5880</a>/rfc5881.&nbsp; Does it need to be required again?<br><br><br>466	&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Apply "policy" to allow BFD packets only from certain subnets or<br>467	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hosts.<br><br>[nit] s/allow BFD packets/process BFD packets<br><br>Given the statement in the Introduction about this document applying only to single IP hops, it seems that "certain subnets" are unnecessary as all the addresses on connected interfaces should fall on the same subnet.<br><br>468	&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Deploy the feature only in certain "trustworthy" environment,<br>469	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.g., at an IXP, or between a provider and its customers.<br><br>If this measure is mandatory, please expand on what a ""trustworthy" environment" is.<br><br><br>470	&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Use BFD authentication, see [<a href="/doc/rfc5880/">RFC5880</a>].&nbsp; In some environments, e.g.<br>471	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when using an IXP, BFD authentication can not be used because of<br>472	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the lack of coordination into the operation of the two endpoints<br>473	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the BFD session.&nbsp; In other environments, e.g. when BFD is used<br>474	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to track the next hop of static routes, it is possible to use BFD<br>475	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authentication: this comes with the extra cost of configuring<br>476	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; matching key-chains at the two endpoints.&nbsp; If BFD authentication<br>477	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is used, the Meticulous Keyed SHA1 mechanism SHOULD be used.</div></td>

My subsequent discuss comments assume the latter.&nbsp; Either way, it would be helpful for this text in this section (and probably the YANG module) to be a bit more explicit on this regard.&nbsp; &nbsp;

When a past IESG approved BFD for<br>standardization in that form, it was exactly because both endpoints<br>needed to be configured, which significantly reduces the<br>possibility/impact of unilateral misconfiguration. I don't believe<br>the suggestions above provide nearly the same level of protection.<br>Also, if (all of?) these are mandatory, that needs to be made very<br>clear, i.e., using <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> terms here and elsewhere in the document<br>(where it currently says these mechanisms are recommended...)</div></td>

Why is this the proper<br>: type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard, since this provides updates to the BFD YANG module.<br><br>: (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>: Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be<br>: found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>: announcement contains the following sections: <br>: <br>: Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes a profile for the Bi-directional Forwarding Detection<br>(BFD) protocol for "sessionless" applications.&nbsp; This permits a single active<br>side to initiate a BFD session with a passive "unsolicited" side.&nbsp; The<br>unsolicited side does not require per-session configuration.<br><br>An example of such a session is protecting the reachability of a static route's<br>nexthop by configuring BFD on the static route without requiring the device<br>with the target nexthop to have the other half of the session configured.<br><br>: Working Group Summary:<br>: <br>: Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there<br>: controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus<br>: was particularly rough? <br><br>This document was considered non-controversial and has been previously deployed<br>in multiple implementations.&nbsp; Since the document includes an extension to the<br>BFD YANG module, publication was delayed until the dependent YANG module was on<br>its way to IETF publication as an RFC.<br><br>: Document Quality:<br>: <br>: Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number<br>: of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any<br>: reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g.,<br>: one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no<br>: substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other<br>: expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type<br>: review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are multiple implementations of this mechanism.&nbsp; Since the BFD YANG module is<br>new (<a href="/doc/rfc9127/">RFC 9127</a>) as of this writeup, there are currently no implementations of the<br>augmentation module contained in this document. <br><br>: Personnel:<br>: <br>: Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd: Jeffrey Haas, BFD co-chair.<br>Responsible Area Director: John Scudder, Routing.<br><br>: (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>: Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>: publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>This document has been through multiple Working Group review cycles.&nbsp; A number<br>of minor clarifications were done in the final revisions of the document as<br>part of resolving the last portion of Working Group Last Call comments.&nbsp; These<br>revisions increased the clarity of the document.<br><br>: (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of<br>: the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>: (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>: perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>: internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>: (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has<br>: with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be<br>: aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of<br>: the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any<br>: event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still<br>: wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>: (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>: required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>: already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The IPR attestations from the authors are documented in this mail thread:<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rtg-bfd/sFDEO17QJ2h-zqOncfEwLclGpvs/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/rtg-bfd/sFDEO17QJ2h-zqOncfEwLclGpvs/</a><br><br>All authors have confirmed that there are no IPR declarations vs. the document.<br><br>: (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>: summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>: (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>: strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br>: WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The BFD Working Group has a small number of technically informed participants.<br>This document received good review from active Working Group members.<br><br>: (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>: If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>: Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>: questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>: (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.<br>: (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist).<br>: Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>ID-Nits shows 3 long-line errors.&nbsp; Since these errors are related to formatting style<br>for the YANG module, the shepherd would prefer that these are resolved by the <br>RFC Editor as they normalize the module for publication.<br><br>Similarly, the error of a reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a> is being deferred for resolution by<br>the RFC Editor as part of their style choices for this document.<br><br>: (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such<br>: as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The YANG module in this document was reviewed by the YANG doctors and the<br>points raised had been resolved.<br><br>The publication of this document was deferred until the BFD YANG module was<br>ready to hit RFC.&nbsp; (That RFC-to-be is <a href="/doc/rfc9127/">RFC 9127</a>.)<br><br>: (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>: normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>: (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>: advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references<br>: exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>: (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so,<br>: list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call<br>: procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>: (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>: Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>: discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>: Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>: relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>: information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it<br>: unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>There was Working Group discussion as to whether this document would be an<br>update to <a href="/doc/rfc5881/">RFC 5881</a>.&nbsp; After discussion within the working group and the Area<br>Director at the time, it was determined that there are no normative protocol<br>changes created in this document to that RFC.&nbsp; This document merely documents a<br>profile of <a href="/doc/rfc5881/">RFC 5881</a>.<br><br>: (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>: section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>: document.
