Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>* Technical Summary:<br><br>The present document and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-sid/">draft-ietf-core-sid</a> together provide the foundation to extend YANG-based management down to constrained devices (<a href="/doc/rfc7228/">RFC 7228</a>).<br><br>In particular, the present document defines encoding rules for serializing YANG using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/rfc8949/">RFC8949</a>], specifically configuration data, state data, RPC input and RPC output, action input, action output, notifications and yang-data extension defined within YANG modules.<br><br>The companion document <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-sid/">draft-ietf-core-sid</a> defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID) and a file format used to persist and publish assigned YANG SIDs.<br><br>The two other documents <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-comi/">draft-ietf-core-comi</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-yang-library/">draft-ietf-core-yang-library</a> apply the two documents above, by using the CoAP protocol (<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>) for access and providing information to be used in conjunction with CoRE resource discovery (<a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a>).<br><br>* Working Group Summary:<br><br>The suite of documents spans specific areas of interest of several WGs, in particular NETMOD, CBOR, and CORE, as well as NETCONF. This required coordination between authors and reviewers that see different of these WGs as their central point of activity. While the documents were stable already for a while, a specific issue on representing YANG unions required somewhat unsavory resolutions, which held up the process considerably.<br><br>* Document Quality:<br><br>Since the document became a WG document in April 2016, several reviews were provided by members of the concerned WGs.<br><br>Of particular interest is the review by Jürgen Schönwälder : <br><br>Jürgen as well as Andy Bierman were very helpful in resolving remaining issues about this document as well. Andy is also is a co-author of the <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-comi/">draft-ietf-core-comi</a> specification using the present document and the companion document draft-ietf-core-sid.<br><br>Version -16 addressed Last-Call review comments received from Yangdoctors and Genart.<br><br>A review was requested on the media-types. No objections were raised. <br><br><br>* Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Marco Tiloca <br>Area Director: Francesca Palombini <br><br>Carsten Bormann served as Document Shepherd up until version -15 included, thus taking care of most of the shepherding process and especially providing the original version of this writeup.<br><br><br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The original document shepherd actively followed the creation of this document and provided a shepherd review that included nits fixed in the most recent versions. The original document shepherd believes this document is ready for publication.<br><br>The current document shepherd has further reviewed the document, has no concerns and concurs with the judgdment of the original document shepherd.<br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The netconf/netmod perspective was mainly addressed in physical side meetings at IETFs and in personal reviews. Briefly, there was traffic on the mailing list <a href="mailto:yot@ietf.org">yot@ietf.org</a>, as well, approximately 100 messages by some 12 individuals.<br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>(N/A)<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that they do not have any direct, personal knowledge of any patent claim ("IPR") related to each of the drafts where they are listed as author.<br><br>&gt; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>As of 2021-06-21, no.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Many members of the WG do not see YANG as a primary management interface for their work on constrained devices. There has been little opposition against pursuing this as an additional approach though. Between the individuals who want to make use of YANG for constrained devices, there is strong consensus.<br><br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>ID nits found during the shepherd review were addressed in the most recent versions.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>We are waiting for feedback on the request for media-type review (see above).<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>This document has normative references to RFCs only. Also, it has informative references to the other CORECONF documents <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-comi/">draft-ietf-core-comi</a> and draft-ietf-core-sid.<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>This document has a relatively plain IANA considerations section, only adding items to existing registries.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

Abstract:<br> This document defines encoding rules for serializing configuration<br>&nbsp;  data, state data, RPC input and RPC output, action input, action<br>&nbsp;  output, notifications and the yang-data extension defined within YANG<br>&nbsp;  modules using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, <a href="/doc/rfc8949/">RFC<br>&nbsp;  8949</a>).<br>&nbsp;  <br>When I read the abstract, it raises the question about what is left out.&nbsp; Hence, I am wondering whether it wouldn't be better to just describe it as encoding<br>YANG data tree instance data.&nbsp; However, I see that the description effectively mirrors the abstract for the YANG JSON encoding (<a href="/doc/rfc7951/">RFC 7951</a>), so it is at least<br>consistent.<br><br><br>2. I find this document (along with the SID draft), somewhat confusing in that it references YANG schema nodes, but in most cases, it probably<br>only cares about the subset of YAND schema nodes that represent itemsthat are present in data tree instantiation.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC 7950</a> calls such 'schema nodes' as 'data nodes'.&nbsp; For example, 'choice', 'case', 'input' and 'output' exist as nodes in the YANG schema tree, but are not data nodes and don't appear as instantiated data nodes.<br><br>Where this causes problems are in the definitions of: 'child' - (e.g., 'case' cannot be a child of a 'container' only a child of a 'choice', and equivalently for the definition of 'parent'.&nbsp; This definitions are not heavily used and could perhaps be removed?<br><br>Hence my suggestion to clarify the text are:<br> - potentially import and use data node rather than schema node.&nbsp; Note that data node, as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC 7950</a>, is a subset of schema nodes, so you still need the text saying an instance of a data node.&nbsp; Arguably, the <a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC 7950</a> definition of a data node is somewhat confusing.<br> - please check everywhere where 'schema node' or 'data node' turns up in the text to ensure that you are referencing instances of that schema node rather than the schema node itself.&nbsp; E.g., the second paragraph in section 3 states 'where each child schema node is encoded ...', but this should be an instance of child schema node.<br> - ensure that if you are referring to the parent or child of a 'schema node' that the logic skip out the schema nodes that don't get encoded in the data tree.&nbsp; E.g., when calculating SIDs.<br><br><br>3. I think that some of the references to submodules are not quite right.&nbsp; Basically, the CBOR encoding should not need to concern itself about submodules at all, since logically, it works with the module schema (which logically incorporates the submodules).&nbsp; E.g., perhaps you could mention this in the introduction, referencing section 4.2.1 (4th paragraph in particular) of <a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC 7950</a>?<br><br>Hence:<br>In section 2:<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; item: A schema node, an identity, a module, a submodule, or a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; feature defined using the YANG modeling language.<br><br>I think that this should exclude submodule (and possibly feature as well).<br><br>In section 3.2:<br>&nbsp;  YANG modules, submodules, and features<br><br>I don't think that you want submodules in this list (and perhaps not features either).<br><br>And in: <br>	6.13.1.&nbsp; SIDs as instance-identifier<br><br>	&nbsp;  SIDs uniquely identify a schema node.&nbsp; In the case of a single<br>	&nbsp;  instance schema node, i.e., a schema node defined at the root of a<br>	&nbsp;  YANG module or submodule or schema nodes defined within a container,<br>	&nbsp;  the SID is sufficient to identify this instance.<br><br>I would remove "or submodule" from this text.&nbsp; Effectively, the text about<br>modules already covers this.<br><br><br>4. Please check the text that describes how lists are encoded.&nbsp; Section 4.2 seems to suggest that they are encoded as a CBOR Map, section 4.4 states that they are encoded as an array.&nbsp; I presume that the answer is that they encode the list is an array, and each list entry is a Map.<br><br><br>5.<br>&nbsp;  Values of 'bits' types defined in a 'union' type MUST be encoded<br>&nbsp;  using a CBOR text string data item (major type 3) and MUST contain a<br>&nbsp;  space-separated sequence of names of 'bits' that are set<br>&nbsp;  <br>It might be helpful to have a quick sentence to justify why this is done.<br><br>Regards,<br>Rob</div></td>

 This specification supports two types of CBOR keys; SID as defined in<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.2 and names as defined in Section 3.3.<br><br>I suggest making an explicit statement about whether the two types of<br>keys can be comingled in the same container/etc, possibly just by<br>forward-reference to the media-type parameter.<br><br>Section 4.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In the context of containers and other nodes from the data tree, CBOR<br>&nbsp;  map keys within inner CBOR maps can be encoded using deltas or SIDs.<br>&nbsp;  In the case of deltas, they MUST be encoded using a CBOR unsigned<br>&nbsp;  integer (major type 0) or CBOR negative integer (major type 1),<br>&nbsp;  depending on the actual delta value.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's a little surprising that we only get this extended discussion on<br>SID use in §4.2.1, when we already had §4.1.1 "Using SIDs in keys" that<br>said almost nothing about it.<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] A namespace-qualified name<br>&nbsp;  MUST be used each time the namespace of a schema node and its parent<br>&nbsp;  differ.&nbsp; In all other cases, the simple form of the name MUST be<br>&nbsp;  used.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>We have a similar statement in §3.3 that is only "the simple form of the<br>name SHOULD be used" for the latter sentence.&nbsp; It's not entirely clear<br>to me what causes the strength of requirement to be different between<br>the two cases.<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>Do we want to explicitly acknowledge the mismatch between the "xml" in<br>"anyxml" and the actual CBOR contents?<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The yang-data extensions encoded using names are carried in a CBOR<br>&nbsp;  map containing a single item pair.&nbsp; The key of this item is set to<br>&nbsp;  the namespace qualified name of the yang-data extension container;<br>&nbsp;  the value is set to the CBOR encoding of this container as defined in<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.3.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is a nit or not, so putting it here: is §3.3 the<br>right reference for the encoding of the container (vs. §4.2)?<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>Requiring the string form for enumeration constants in a union seems<br>like a big loss on encoded size.&nbsp; Is it worth putting some discussion in<br>the document (or an appendix thereto) about why other options like<br>tagged integer are not usable?&nbsp; (Similar discussion might be relevant<br>for the bits-in-union case.)<br><br>While it's banal, we might also put an example of the integer-encoded<br>form (as used by non-union contexts) so that the tagged-text-string<br>example isn't the only one given.<br><br>&nbsp;  Leafs of type enumeration MUST be encoded using a CBOR unsigned<br>&nbsp;  integer (major type 0) or CBOR negative integer (major type 1),<br>&nbsp;  depending on the actual value.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think we should also mention the tagged-text-string case here.<br><br>Section 6.7<br><br>&nbsp;  In a number of cases the array would only need to have one element -<br>&nbsp;  a byte string with a small number of bytes inside.&nbsp; For this case, it<br>&nbsp;  is expected to omit the array element and have only the byte array<br>&nbsp;  that would have been inside.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think it is actually required (not just "expected") based on some<br>later text.<br><br>Section 6.10, 6.13<br><br>I strongly encourage explicit mention of the use of a CBOR tag when<br>these elements appear inside a union, analogous to the text in §6.6 and<br>6.7.&nbsp; The list in §6.12 is pretty easy to miss, and the word "tag" does<br>not appear at all in these sections.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification defines the media-type "application/yang-<br>&nbsp;  data+cbor", which can be used without parameters or with the<br>&nbsp;  parameter "id=name" or "id=sid".<br><br>I think the media-type discussions should refer to the "id" parameter<br>and the two possible values for that parameter ('=' is not allowed in a<br>parameter name).<br><br>&nbsp;  This media-type represents a CBOR YANG document containing one or<br>&nbsp;  multiple data node values.&nbsp; Depending on the presence and value of<br>&nbsp;  the media-type parameter "id", each data node is identified by its<br>&nbsp;  associated namespace qualified name as defined in Section 3.3<br>&nbsp;  ("id=name"), by its associated YANG SID (represented as a SID delta<br>&nbsp;  or via tag 47) as defined in Section 3.2 ("id=sid"), or either of<br>&nbsp;  these (no "id" parameter given).<br><br>I think that for identityref and instance-identifier we don't use the<br>tag 47 for absolute (non-delta) SIDs, at least outside of a union<br>context.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>It might be worth mentioning that when the 'id' parameter to the media<br>type is used, it's important to properly reject identifiers of the other<br>type, to avoid scenarios where different implementations interpret a<br>given content in different ways.<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>It's not clear to me that <a href="/doc/rfc6241/">RFC 6241</a> needs to be classified as normative,<br>at least based on the one place in the text where we reference it.<br><br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; child: A schema node defined as a child node of a container, a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list, a case, a notification, an RPC input, an RPC output, an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; action input, or an action output.<br><br>Is this enumeration of "parent" node types guaranteed to be fixed for<br>all time, or should we consider a more generic wording to describe it?<br>(Likewise for the "parent" definition.)<br><br>Section 4<br><br>The example from <a href="/doc/rfc7317/">RFC 7317</a> may have truncated a little too much of the<br>content; "mandatory true" for choice transport, the "inet:" prefix for<br>"type inet:host" and "inet:port-number", etc.<br><br>Section 4.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Deltas of list members are equal to the SID of the current schema<br>&nbsp;  node minus the SID of the 'list'.<br><br>This seems redundant with the list of "Delta values are computed as<br>follows" from §4.2.1.<br><br>Section 4.5<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CBOR map keys of any inner schema nodes MUST be set to valid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deltas or names.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The CBOR array MUST contain either unique scalar values (as a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leaf-list, see Section 4.3), or maps (as a list, see Section 4.4).<br><br>I think a parallel list structure would be "CBOR arrays MUST contain<br>[...]".<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; CBOR map values MUST follow the encoding rules of one of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; datatypes listed in Section 4.<br><br>(A recursive reference, though I mostly trust the reader to pick out the<br>relevant subsections.)<br><br>Section 4.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In some implementations, it might be simpler to use the absolute SID<br>&nbsp;  tag encoding for the anydata root element.&nbsp; The resulting encoding is<br>&nbsp;  as follows:<br><br>Pedantically, what follows is diagnostic notation, not a CBOR encoding.<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>&nbsp;  An anyxml schema node is used to serialize an arbitrary CBOR content,<br>&nbsp;  i.e., its value can be any CBOR binary object. anyxml value MAY<br>&nbsp;  contain CBOR data items tagged with one of the tags listed in<br>&nbsp;  Section 9.3.&nbsp; The tags listed in Section 9.3 SHALL be supported.<br><br>The second sentence seems to both not start with a capital letter and<br>have a singular/plural mismatch, both of which could be resolved by<br>adding "An" at the start.<br><br>Section 6.13.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Single instance schema nodes MUST be encoded using a CBOR unsigned<br>&nbsp;  integer data item (major type 0) and set to the targeted schema node<br>&nbsp;  SID.<br><br>Should we say something about the lack of a delta encoding in this<br>context, analogous to §6.10.1?</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>* Technical Summary:<br><br>The two drafts provide the foundation to extend YANG-based management<br>down to constrained devices (<a href="/doc/rfc7228/">RFC 7228</a>).&nbsp; The parts are:<br><br>yang-cbor:<br>:&nbsp; encoding rules for serializing YANG using the Concise Binary Object<br>&nbsp;  Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/rfc8949/">RFC8949</a>], specifically configuration data,<br>&nbsp;  state data, RPC input and RPC output, action input, action output,<br>&nbsp;  notifications and yang-data extension defined within YANG modules.<br><br>sid:<br>:&nbsp; the semantics, the registration, and assignment processes of YANG<br>&nbsp;  Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SIDs), globally unique 63-bit<br>&nbsp;  unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.&nbsp; To enable these<br>&nbsp;  processes, also defines a file format used to persist and publish<br>&nbsp;  assigned YANG SIDs.<br><br>The other two drafts, comi and yang-library, apply these drafts by<br>using the CoAP protocol (<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>) for access and providing<br>information to be used in conjunction with CoRE resource discovery<br>(<a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a>).<br><br>* Working Group Summary:<br><br>The suite of documents spans specific areas of interest of several<br>WGs, in particular NETMOD, CBOR, and CORE, as well as NETCONF.<br>This required coordination between authors and reviewers that see<br>different of these WGs as their central point of activity.<br>While the documents were stable already for a while, a specific issue<br>on representing YANG unions required somewhat unsavory resolutions,<br>which held up the process considerably.<br><br>* Document Quality:<br><br>Since the documents became WG documents (in Apr 2016 and Oct 2016),<br>several reviews were provided by members of the concerned WGs.<br><br>Of particular interest are the reviews by Jürgen Schönwälder:<br>yang-cbor-12: <br>sid: <br>Jürgen as well as Andy Bierman were very helpful in resolving<br>remaining issues about these documents as well (Andy also is a<br>co-author on the comi specification using these two documents).<br><br>The SID process is implemented in PYANG modules.<br>Various parts of the protocol are implemented in proprietary software,<br>however there is no single go-to implementation that could be<br>mentioned here.<br><br>We are waiting for feedback on the media-types review request,<br>archived at:<br><br><br><br>* Personnel:<br><br>Carsten Bormann serves as Document Shepherd.<br>Barry Leiba is the Responsible Area Director for the CoRE WG.<br><br><br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd has actively followed the creation of these two<br>document and has provided a shepherd review that included nits fixed<br>in the most recent versions.<br>The document shepherd believes these documents are ready for publication.<br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The netconf/netmod perspective was mainly addressed in physical side<br>meetings at IETFs and in personal reviews.&nbsp; Briefly, there was traffic<br>on the mailing list <a href="mailto:yot@ietf.org">yot@ietf.org</a>, as well, approximately 100 messages<br>by some 12 individuals.<br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>(N/A)<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that they do not have any direct, personal<br>knowledge of any patent claim ("IPR") related to each of the drafts<br>where they are listed as author.<br><br>&gt; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>As of 2021-02-04, no.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Many members of the WG don't see YANG as a primary management<br>interface for their work on constrained devices.&nbsp; There has been<br>little opposition against pursuing this as an additional approach<br>though.&nbsp; Between the individuals who want to make use of YANG for<br>constrained devices, there is strong consensus.<br><br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>ID nits the shepherd found were addressed in the most recent versions.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The YANG module in sid (a data format specification) does not have warnings.<br><br>We are waiting for feedback on the request for media-type review (see above).<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>yang-cbor has normative references to RFCs only.<br>sid has a normative reference to yang-cbor.<br>(Both have informative references to some of the other CORECONF documents.)<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>yang-cbor has a relatively plain IANA considerations section, only<br>adding items to existing registries.<br>sid has some real innovations in the interactions with IANA, which<br>were the result of extensive interactions between IANA and the<br>authors and WG chairs.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>sid creates the "YANG SID Mega-Range" registry, the "IETF YANG SID<br>Range" registry, and the "IETF YANG SID Registry".&nbsp; All require Expert<br>Review, both with respect to properly curating a somewhat limited<br>resource, and with respect to technical soundness of the registrations.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>sid defines a YANG module ietf-sid-file that passes the validation<br>provided by the datatracker.<br>yang-cbor contains a single line of ABNF using a production from RFC<br>Pu7950, which validates with "bap".<br>yang-cbor also contains many snippets of YANG that have been<br>eyeball-verified only.<br><br>&gt; (20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>sid defines a YANG module ietf-sid-file that passes the validation<br>provided by the datatracker.<br>This YANG module does not define a datastore, so NMDA does not apply.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Both documents are intended for standards-track (Proposed Standard),<br>as they together with the other two provide the CORECONF<br>specification, but also can be used individually as interoperability<br>protocols outside of that shared context.<br><br>&gt; (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>* Technical Summary:<br><br>The two drafts provide the foundation to extend YANG-based management<br>down to constrained devices (<a href="/doc/rfc7228/">RFC 7228</a>).&nbsp; The parts are:<br><br>yang-cbor:<br>:&nbsp; encoding rules for serializing YANG using the Concise Binary Object<br>&nbsp;  Representation (CBOR) [<a href="/doc/rfc8949/">RFC8949</a>], specifically configuration data,<br>&nbsp;  state data, RPC input and RPC output, action input, action output,<br>&nbsp;  notifications and yang-data extension defined within YANG modules.<br><br>sid:<br>:&nbsp; the semantics, the registration, and assignment processes of YANG<br>&nbsp;  Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SIDs), globally unique 63-bit<br>&nbsp;  unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.&nbsp; To enable these<br>&nbsp;  processes, also defines a file format used to persist and publish<br>&nbsp;  assigned YANG SIDs.<br><br>The other two drafts, comi and yang-library, apply these drafts by<br>using the CoAP protocol (<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>) for access and providing<br>information to be used in conjunction with CoRE resource discovery<br>(<a href="/doc/rfc6690/">RFC 6690</a>).<br><br>* Working Group Summary:<br><br>The suite of documents spans specific areas of interest of several<br>WGs, in particular NETMOD, CBOR, and CORE, as well as NETCONF.<br>This required coordination between authors and reviewers that see<br>different of these WGs as their central point of activity.<br>While the documents were stable already for a while, a specific issue<br>on representing YANG unions required somewhat unsavory resolutions,<br>which held up the process considerably.<br><br>* Document Quality:<br><br>Since the documents became WG documents (in Apr 2016 and Oct 2016),<br>several reviews were provided by members of the concerned WGs.<br><br>Of particular interest are the reviews by Jürgen Schönwälder:<br>yang-cbor-12: <br>sid: <br>Jürgen as well as Andy Bierman were very helpful in resolving<br>remaining issues about these documents as well (Andy also is a<br>co-author on the comi specification using these two documents).<br><br>The SID process is implemented in PYANG modules.<br>Various parts of the protocol are implemented in proprietary software,<br>however there is no single go-to implementation that could be<br>mentioned here.<br><br>We are waiting for feedback on the media-types review request,<br>archived at:<br><br><br><br>* Personnel:<br><br>Carsten Bormann serves as Document Shepherd.<br>Barry Leiba is the Responsible Area Director for the CoRE WG.<br><br><br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd has actively followed the creation of these two<br>document and has provided a shepherd review that included nits fixed<br>in the most recent versions.<br>The document shepherd believes these documents are ready for publication.<br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The netconf/netmod perspective was mainly addressed in physical side<br>meetings at IETFs and in personal reviews.&nbsp; Briefly, there was traffic<br>on the mailing list <a href="mailto:yot@ietf.org">yot@ietf.org</a>, as well, approximately 100 messages<br>by some 12 individuals.<br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>(N/A)<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that they do not have any direct, personal<br>knowledge of any patent claim ("IPR") related to each of the drafts<br>where they are listed as author.<br><br>&gt; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>As of 2021-02-04, no.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Many members of the WG don't see YANG as a primary management<br>interface for their work on constrained devices.&nbsp; There has been<br>little opposition against pursuing this as an additional approach<br>though.&nbsp; Between the individuals who want to make use of YANG for<br>constrained devices, there is strong consensus.<br><br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>ID nits the shepherd found were addressed in the most recent versions.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The YANG module in sid (a data format specification) does not have warnings.<br><br>We are waiting for feedback on the request for media-type review (see above).<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>yang-cbor has normative references to RFCs only.<br>sid has a normative reference to yang-cbor.<br>(Both have informative references to some of the other CORECONF documents.)<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>yang-cbor has a relatively plain IANA considerations section, only<br>adding items to existing registries.<br>sid has some real innovations in the interactions with IANA, which<br>were the result of extensive interactions between IANA and the<br>authors and WG chairs.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>sid creates the "YANG SID Mega-Range" registry, the "IETF YANG SID<br>Range" registry, and the "IETF YANG SID Registry".&nbsp; All require Expert<br>Review, both with respect to properly curating a somewhat limited<br>resource, and with respect to technical soundness of the registrations.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>sid defines a YANG module ietf-sid-file that passes the validation<br>provided by the datatracker.<br>yang-cbor contains a single line of ABNF using a production from RFC<br>Pu7950, which validates with "bap".<br>yang-cbor also contains many snippets of YANG that have been<br>eyeball-verified only.<br><br>&gt; (20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>sid defines a YANG module ietf-sid-file that passes the validation<br>provided by the datatracker.<br>This YANG module does not define a datastore, so NMDA does not apply.<br></div></td>
