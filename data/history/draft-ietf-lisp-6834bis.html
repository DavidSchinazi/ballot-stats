Isn’t the map-version more in the nature of a hint than a critical-for-correctness field? What bad behavior is being protected against by silently dropping this traffic, that has arrived at a correct endpoint albeit with an incorrect hint?<br><br>At various points in the document there's a kind of vague assertion that incorrect map-versions could be an attack. While I don't deny that, the assertion isn't supported or elaborated on anywhere that I saw, which is worrying and also makes it less convincing. Shouldn't the Security Considerations talk about this? I did also go have a look at the Security Considerations in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis/31/">draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis-31</a>, which also didn't help me. <a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC 7835</a> §3.3 does touch on this, suggesting that maybe an attacker could use a spoofed Map-Version to trigger a DoS attack. But this, too, is an unsatisfying rationale, since as you take pains to point out, rate limiting of Map-Requests and such is required. Furthermore, if triggering Map-Requests is the concern, couldn't the packet still be delivered, without triggering a Map-Request?<br><br>When this was an Experimental protocol this kind of thing was probably less crucial to justify and explain, but I would have expected the experiment to produce results that could be fed into this document. At the moment, the "drop any packet that doesn't comply with expectations" design feels arbitrary and potentially brittle. I would appreciate some discussion of this design choice, thanks in advance.<br><br>(I do acknowledge that security matters can be subtle, and I'm not a SEC AD after all... but all the more reason for the document to be explicit about what the security concerns are instead of just gesturing toward them and leaving the reader to guess.)<br><br>Original COMMENT:<br><br>I support Roman Danyliw's DISCUSS position.<br><br>I have a number of further questions and comments --<br><br>1. In §6.1:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If an ETR receives LISP-encapsulated packets with the V-bit<br>&nbsp;  set, when the original mapping in the EID-to-RLOC Database has the<br>&nbsp;  version number set to the Null Map-Version value, then those packets<br>&nbsp;  MUST be silently dropped.<br><br>What does “original” mean in this context? Couldn’t the mapping in the db once have had a value but in a later revision, had its value changed to the null value? Presumably in such a situation packets would be lost until the ITR decided to issue a new map-request. <br><br><br>2. In §7.1 (3):<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to rate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  limitation policy defined in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis</a>] for Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Request messages, after 10 retries Map-Requests are sent every 30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  seconds, if in the meantime the Dest Map-Version number in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  packets is not updated, the ETR SHOULD drop packets with a stale<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Version number. <br><br>What exactly is “the meantime”? Does that mean “after 10 retries”? After 30 seconds? Basically, what precisely is the grace period extended to the ITR have to come into compliance before being blocked? This seems important to be clear about -- even if the clarity is in the form of "it's implementation-dependent".<br><br><br>3. In §7.1, final paragraph:<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP-encapsulated packets cannot transport a Dest Map-Version number<br>&nbsp;  equal to the Null Map-Version number, because in this case the ETR is<br>&nbsp;  signaling that Map-Version numbers are not used for the mapping of<br>&nbsp;  the destination EID (see Section 6.1).<br><br>Considering that the Null Map-Version number is just the distinguished value 0, the first clause is prima facie wrong -- it's possible to encode 0 in that field. I think what you mean is something more along the lines of <br><br>&nbsp;  It is a protocol violation for LISP-encapsulated packets to contain a <br>&nbsp;  Dest Map-Version number equal to the Null Map-Version number, see <br>&nbsp;  Section 6.1.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Please don't try to explain it again in-line as you've done, it just confuses the reader (well, it confused me!). Instead, refer them back to the place where you specified the rule. <br><br>It does seem unfortunate that in this case, it's not possible to include a Source Map-Version number, even if that would be helpful to do, since the V bit is required to be set to 0 and covers both Source and Dest. <br><br><br>4. §7.1 (3), nit: s/The packets arrive/The packet arrives/<br><br><br>5. In §7.1 and §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A check on this version number SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  done, where the following cases can arise:<br>&nbsp;  <br>and<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the ETR has an entry in its EID-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp;  Map-Cache for the source EID, then a check SHOULD be performed and<br>&nbsp;  the following cases can arise:<br><br>What are the cases under which the check can be omitted? Please consider adding discussion about those cases. Alternately, consider making the SHOULD a MUST if there are no such cases.<br><br><br>6. In §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The packet arrives with a Source Map-Version number smaller<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (i.e., older) than the one stored in the local EID-to-RLOC Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Cache.&nbsp; Such a case is not valid with respect to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  specifications.<br><br>The final sentence ("not valid") seems like it must be wrong: consider for example the case of out-of-order packets. Other scenarios also exist, such as transient non-synchronization between ETRs during convergence. I notice that §9 talks about the lack of synchronization mechanisms in LISP, other than diligent consistency of configuration. So, I guess there's a good chance that "convergence" means "someone updating mapping configurations by hand" and so version skew could exist for human-scale periods of time. Of greatest concern is if "human-scale periods of time" means "hours or days" in the case where a mistake with operational procedures leaves the hand-configured databases on two ETRs out of sync with one another.<br><br>I guess a minimum fix would be to simply cut the wrong sentence and slightly re-word, e.g.:<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The packet arrives with a Source Map-Version number smaller<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (i.e., older) than the one stored in the local EID-to-RLOC Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Cache.&nbsp; Note that if the mapping is already present in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache, this means that an explicit Map-Request<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  has been sent and a Map-Reply has been received from an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authoritative source.&nbsp; In this situation, the packet SHOULD be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  silently dropped.&nbsp; Operators can configure exceptions to this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  recommendation, which are outside the scope of this document.<br><br><br>7. In §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  If the ETR does not have an entry in the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache for<br>&nbsp;  the source EID, then the Source Map-Version number MUST be ignored.<br><br>I think it would be nice to have an xref to §A.1, where the reason for this is explained. Otherwise it seems rather arbitrary.<br><br><br>8. In §8:<br><br>I see that in -12 you cut the text that in -11 used to say<br><br>&nbsp;  Map-Versioning MUST NOT be used over the public Internet and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  only be used in trusted and closed deployments.<br><br>I note that the requirement continues to exist however, since normative reference <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/38/">draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis-38</a> §4.1 says<br><br>&nbsp;  Several of the mechanisms in this document are intended for<br>&nbsp;  deployment in controlled, trusted environments, and are insecure for<br>&nbsp;  use over the public Internet.&nbsp; In particular, on the public internet<br>&nbsp;  xTRs:<br>...<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; MUST NOT use Gleaning or Locator-Status-Bits and Map-Versioning,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as described in Section 13 to update the EID-to-RLOC Mappings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead relying solely on control-plane methods.<br><br>Thus it still seems to me that the questions others raised about this requirement may be relevant.<br><br>So, I question whether cutting the text is the right way to fix the concerns. It makes sense in an Experimental document, but perhaps not in a Standards Track one.<br><br><br>9. In §9:<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP requires ETRs to provide the same mapping for the same EID-<br>&nbsp;  Prefix to a requester.<br><br>What does this mean? Same as what? I guess maybe what you mean here is "LISP requires multiple ETRs within the same site to provide identical mappings for a given EID-Prefix"? If so, please say that (or something else clearer than what's there now). If not, please help?<br><br><br>10. In §A.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  The ETR checks only the Dest Map-Version number as described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7, ignoring the Source Map-Version number.<br><br>I would rewrite as<br><br>&nbsp;  The ETR checks only the Dest Map-Version number, <br>&nbsp;  ignoring the Source Map-Version number as specified in<br>&nbsp;  the final sentence of Section 7,.<br><br><br>11. In §A.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISP interworking<br>&nbsp;  defines three techniques to make LISP sites and non-LISP sites,<br>&nbsp;  namely Proxy-ITR, LISP-NAT, and Proxy-ETR. <br><br>This isn't a complete sentence. I guess what you mean is something like "LISP interworking defines three techniques to allow communication between LISP and non-LISP sites"?<br><br><br>12. In §A.2.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  With this setup, LISP Domain A is able to check whether the PITR is<br>&nbsp;  using the latest mapping.<br><br>First, how does Domain A check this? Second, the latest mapping for what? I suppose you might mean something like "Domain A is able to check whether the PITR is using the latest mapping for the destination EID, by inspecting the Destination Map-Version as detailed in Section 7.1"?<br><br><br>13. In §A.2.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  With this setup, the Proxy-ETR, by looking at the Source Map-Version<br>&nbsp;  Number, is able to check whether the mapping has changed.<br><br>Again, what mapping, and how? I guess it must be the source EID. (The version 12 text, which I've quoted here, makes that clearer, although it would still be even clearer to write "... check whether the Source EID-to-RLOC mapping has changed.") Why does the ETR care about that? I guess there's the assumption it might be an ITR/ETR passing traffic bidirectionally, in which case the source EID might be useful, but if that's the reason then some words to that effect would help.</div></td>

In §6.1:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If an ETR receives LISP-encapsulated packets with the V-bit<br>&nbsp;  set, when the original mapping in the EID-to-RLOC Database has the<br>&nbsp;  version number set to the Null Map-Version value, then those packets<br>&nbsp;  MUST be silently dropped.<br><br>What does “original” mean in this context? Couldn’t the mapping in the db once have had a value but in a later revision, had its value changed to the null value? Presumably in such a situation packets would be lost until the ITR decided to issue a new map-request. <br><br><br>2. In §7.1 (3):<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to rate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  limitation policy defined in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis/">I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis</a>] for Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Request messages, after 10 retries Map-Requests are sent every 30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  seconds, if in the meantime the Dest Map-Version number in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  packets is not updated, the ETR SHOULD drop packets with a stale<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Map-Version number. <br><br>What exactly is “the meantime”? Does that mean “after 10 retries”? After 30 seconds? Basically, what precisely is the grace period extended to the ITR have to come into compliance before being blocked? This seems important to be clear about -- even if the clarity is in the form of "it's implementation-dependent".<br><br><br>3. In §7.1, final paragraph:<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP-encapsulated packets cannot transport a Dest Map-Version number<br>&nbsp;  equal to the Null Map-Version number, because in this case the ETR is<br>&nbsp;  signaling that Map-Version numbers are not used for the mapping of<br>&nbsp;  the destination EID (see Section 6.1).<br><br>Considering that the Null Map-Version number is just the distinguished value 0, the first clause is prima facie wrong -- it's possible to encode 0 in that field. I think what you mean is something more along the lines of <br><br>&nbsp;  It is a protocol violation for LISP-encapsulated packets to contain a <br>&nbsp;  Dest Map-Version number equal to the Null Map-Version number, see <br>&nbsp;  Section 6.1.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Please don't try to explain it again in-line as you've done, it just confuses the reader (well, it confused me!). Instead, refer them back to the place where you specified the rule. <br><br>It does seem unfortunate that in this case, it's not possible to include a Source Map-Version number, even if that would be helpful to do, since the V bit is required to be set to 0 and covers both Source and Dest. <br><br><br>4. §7.1 (3), nit: s/The packets arrive/The packet arrives/<br><br><br>5. In §7.1 and §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A check on this version number SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  done, where the following cases can arise:<br>&nbsp;  <br>and<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the ETR has an entry in its EID-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp;  Map-Cache for the source EID, then a check SHOULD be performed and<br>&nbsp;  the following cases can arise:<br><br>What are the cases under which the check can be omitted? Please consider adding discussion about those cases. Alternately, consider making the SHOULD a MUST if there are no such cases.<br><br><br>6.

What bad behavior is being protected against by silently dropping this traffic, that has arrived at a correct endpoint albeit with an incorrect hint?<br><br>At various points in the document there's a kind of vague assertion that incorrect map-versions could be an attack. While I don't deny that, the assertion isn't supported or elaborated on anywhere that I saw, which is worrying and also makes it less convincing. Shouldn't the Security Considerations talk about this? I did also go have a look at the Security Considerations in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis/31/">draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis-31</a>, which also didn't help me. <a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC 7835</a> §3.3 does touch on this, suggesting that maybe an attacker could use a spoofed Map-Version to trigger a DoS attack. But this, too, is an unsatisfying rationale, since as you take pains to point out, rate limiting of Map-Requests and such is required. <br><br>When this was an Experimental protocol this kind of thing was probably less crucial to justify and explain, but I would have expected the experiment to produce results that could be fed into this document. At the moment, the "drop any packet that doesn't comply with expectations" design feels arbitrary and potentially brittle. I would appreciate some discussion of this design choice.<br><br>(I do acknowledge that security matters can be subtle, and I'm not a SEC AD after all... but all the more reason for the document to be explicit about what the security concerns are instead of just vaguely gesturing toward them and leaving the reader to guess.)</div></td>

In §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the ETR has an entry in its EID-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp;  Map-Cache for the source EID, then a check SHOULD be performed and<br>&nbsp;  the following cases can arise:<br><br>What are the cases under which the check can be omitted? Please consider adding discussion about those cases. Alternately, consider making the SHOULD a MUST if there are no such cases.<br><br><br>6. In §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The packet arrives with a Source Map-Version number smaller<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (i.e., older) than the one stored in the local EID-to-RLOC Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Cache.&nbsp; Such a case is not valid with respect to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  specifications.<br><br>The final sentence ("not valid") seems like it must be wrong: consider for example the case of out-of-order packets. Other scenarios also exist, such as transient non-synchronization between ETRs during convergence. (I notice that §9 talks about the lack of synchronization mechanisms in LISP, other than diligent consistency of configuration. So, I guess there's a good chance that "convergence" means "someone updating mapping configurations by hand" and so version skew could exist for human-scale periods of time.)<br><br>I'll grant you that the probability seems pretty low that this situation would legitimately arise, but it's a big Internet and there are some surprisingly high-latency paths that exist. To see how it could happen, consider:<br><br>	time&nbsp; &nbsp; event<br>	----&nbsp; &nbsp; -----<br>	t1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ITR sends packet p1 towards ETR with Src M-V = N. p1 flows along a<br>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; high-latency path.<br>	t2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mapping db on ITR is updated such that Src M-V is now N+1<br>	t3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ITR sends packet p2 towards ETR with Src M-V = N+1. p2 flows along<br>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a low-latency path, as do all subsequent packets.<br>	t4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ETR receives p2, notices the change in Src M-V, sends a Map-Request.<br>	t5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ITR receives Map-Request, sends Map-Reply.<br>	t6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ETR receives Map-Reply, updates Map-Cache.<br>	t7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p1 arrives. <br>	<br>It seems plausible for the interval [t2,t6] to be quite short, say a few hundred milliseconds. It's completely plausible for p1 to follow a path that takes more time than that, e.g. RTT to geosynchronous orbit is &gt; 240 ms. <br><br>Given this is a corner case it seems OK to me that you'll throw the packet away... but the "not valid" thing is wrong. You could fix it by simply cutting that sentence and slightly re-wording, e.g.:<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The packet arrives with a Source Map-Version number smaller<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (i.e., older) than the one stored in the local EID-to-RLOC Map-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Cache.&nbsp; Note that if the mapping is already present in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache, this means that an explicit Map-Request<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  has been sent and a Map-Reply has been received from an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authoritative source.&nbsp; In this situation, the packet SHOULD be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  silently dropped.&nbsp; Operators can configure exceptions to this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  recommendation, which are outside the scope of this document.<br><br><br>7. In §7.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  If the ETR does not have an entry in the EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache for<br>&nbsp;  the source EID, then the Source Map-Version number MUST be ignored.<br><br>I think it would be nice to have an xref to §A.1, where the reason for this is explained. Otherwise it seems rather arbitrary.<br><br><br>8. In §8:<br><br>I see that in -12 you cut the text that in -11 used to say<br><br>&nbsp;  Map-Versioning MUST NOT be used over the public Internet and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  only be used in trusted and closed deployments.<br><br>I note that the requirement continues to exist however, since normative reference <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis/38/">draft-ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis-38</a> §4.1 says<br><br>&nbsp;  Several of the mechanisms in this document are intended for<br>&nbsp;  deployment in controlled, trusted environments, and are insecure for<br>&nbsp;  use over the public Internet.&nbsp; In particular, on the public internet<br>&nbsp;  xTRs:<br>...<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; MUST NOT use Gleaning or Locator-Status-Bits and Map-Versioning,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as described in Section 13 to update the EID-to-RLOC Mappings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead relying solely on control-plane methods.<br><br>Thus it still seems to me that the questions others raised about this requirement may be relevant.<br><br>So, I question whether cutting the text is the right way to fix the concerns. It makes sense in an Experimental document, but perhaps not in a Standards Track one.<br><br><br>9. In §9:<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP requires ETRs to provide the same mapping for the same EID-<br>&nbsp;  Prefix to a requester.<br><br>What does this mean? Same as what? I guess maybe what you mean here is "LISP requires multiple ETRs within the same site to provide identical mappings for a given EID-Prefix"? If so, please say that (or something else clearer than what's there now). If not, please help?<br><br><br>10. In §A.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  The ETR checks only the Dest Map-Version number as described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7, ignoring the Source Map-Version number.<br><br>I would rewrite as<br><br>&nbsp;  The ETR checks only the Dest Map-Version number, <br>&nbsp;  ignoring the Source Map-Version number as specified in<br>&nbsp;  the final sentence of Section 7,.<br><br><br>11. In §A.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; LISP interworking<br>&nbsp;  defines three techniques to make LISP sites and non-LISP sites,<br>&nbsp;  namely Proxy-ITR, LISP-NAT, and Proxy-ETR. <br><br>This isn't a complete sentence. I guess what you mean is something like "LISP interworking defines three techniques to allow communication between LISP and non-LISP sites"?<br><br><br>12. In §A.2.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  With this setup, LISP Domain A is able to check whether the PITR is<br>&nbsp;  using the latest mapping.<br><br>First, how does Domain A check this? Second, the latest mapping for what? I suppose you might mean something like "Domain A is able to check whether the PITR is using the latest mapping for the destination EID, by inspecting the Destination Map-Version as detailed in Section 7.1"?<br><br><br>13. In §A.2.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  With this setup, the Proxy-ETR, by looking at the Source Map-Version<br>&nbsp;  Number, is able to check whether the mapping has changed.<br><br>Again, what mapping, and how? I guess it must be the source EID. (The version 12 text, which I've quoted here, makes that clearer, although it would still be even clearer to write "... check whether the Source EID-to-RLOC mapping has changed.") Why does the ETR care about that? I guess there's the assumption it might be an ITR/ETR passing traffic bidirectionally, in which case the source EID might be useful, but if that's the reason then some words to that effect would help.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is targeting publication as a Standards track RFC.<br>It is the proper type of RFC since it provides updates to <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC 6834</a> Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Map-Versioning, which was an experimental document. <br>The RFC type is clearly marked in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>The document proposes a map versioning mechanism for the LISP mapping system to track the EID-locator bindings. The mechanism is based on versioning the bindings and also carrying the version in LISP hear for LISP encapsulated packets. The proposal allows tunnel end point to inform the other of the version of mapping used and indirectly signaling changes in the mapping. <br><br>The proposed mechanism is optional and transparent for nodes not implementing the feature. <br>This document obsoletes the <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC6834</a>. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document was initially written in May 2018 and has mostly the same text as <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC6834</a>. <br>The changes do not impact the clarity of the document and are:<br>1.	Clarification that the mechanism is optional<br>2.	Updated&nbsp; section 8.4 for clarification<br>3.	Removal of redundant section 9 in <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC6834</a> <br>4.	Updated the security section inline with the main specs.<br>5.	Updated section 11 in <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC6834</a> for deployment considerations .<br>6.	Removal of Appendix A of <a href="/doc/rfc6834/">RFC6834</a>. The very small delay was discussed and there was no objection in the working group and support to go rapidly in wg last call.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>The document is a respin from the <a href="/doc/rfc6438/">RFC6438</a> and does not have significant changes except for few parts that made it coherent with the main specs (namely 6830bis and 6833bis).<br><br>There are at least two known implementations of the proposed mechanism (<a href="/doc/rfc6438/">RFC6438</a>)<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>Padma Pillay-Esnault <br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Alvaro Retana <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd.
