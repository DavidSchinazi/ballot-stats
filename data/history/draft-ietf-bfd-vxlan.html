For example, was there<br>: controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus<br>: was particularly rough?<br><br>In spite of significant discussion prior to submitting this document to the<br>IESG, there was much commentary as part of IESG review.<br><br>A substantial amount of review commentary was generated by the original text<br>related to what VNI is being tested using this protocol extension.&nbsp; The<br>majority of this commentary was the result of the security considerations<br>related to how a tenant VNI may benefit from this feature.&nbsp; In particular,<br>how does the protocol attempt to avoid hijacking tenant MAC addresses and<br>necessary IP addressing of the encapsulated BFD packets.<br><br>As part of addressing this issue, the Working Group decided to reduce the<br>general scope of the feature in this document to validating reachability to<br>the management VNI.&nbsp; This removed the related security considerations for<br>the more general mechanism in the proposal.&nbsp; It should be noted that the<br>encapsulation format remains flexible enough that testing non-management<br>VNIs remains feasible, but is now out of scope for this document.<br><br>While VXLAN implementations appear to regularly have forms of "management<br>VNIs", this concept does not appear in the VXLAN architecture documents.<br>The consensus in this document is that VNI number 1 would be the default VNI<br>for the management VNI number.<br><br>Since the management VNI did not have a well known Destination MAC address,<br>the proposal in this document was that one would be allocated from the IANA<br>pool for unicast MAC addresses for this purpose.<br><br>The internal Destination IP address, using the ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104 network<br>in a fashion similar to the MPLS LSP Ping feature required extensive<br>discussion with the IESG.&nbsp; While this usage is well understood in MPLS OAM<br>functionality, it was controversial with one of the reivewing Area Directors.&nbsp; <br>However, that AD's DISCUSS was removed after long discussion. <br><br>The TTL/Hop Limit value and the application of GTSM (<a href="/doc/rfc5082/">RFC 5082</a>) as per BFD<br>core procedural documents was discussed and the document moved to use that<br>procedure even in encapsulated traffic.<br><br>A final note is that issue tracking became challenging during this review<br>and that the IETF would be well served by re-tooling IESG commentary to<br>include an issue tracker as part of the core infrastructure.<br><br>: Document Quality:<br>: <br>: Are there existing implementations of the protocol?

 indistinguishable from data packets.<br><br>nit(?): I suggest s/indistinguishable from/regular/ -- the tenants' BFD<br>sessions are just regular data to the VXLAN infrastructure, though IIUC<br>a VTEP could, if so inclined, peek inside and "distinguish" them from<br>non-BFD tenant data based on on heuristics and packet format.<br><br>&nbsp;

I note that well-known ports are<br>not reserved ports, and we have no guarangee that only a BFD<br>implementation would be listening on port 3784.<br>I think the rewording would include some phrasing like "RECOMMENDED that<br>the only firewall exception to allow incoming traffic with destination<br>address from the loopback range is when [...]", and of course, mention<br>the need to have BFD configured.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;
