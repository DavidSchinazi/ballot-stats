(I recognize that actually doing<br>anything about many of them would be counter to the "keep diff from <a href="/doc/rfc7482/">RFC<br>7482</a> minimal" goal I just complimented, so I don't expect all of them<br>to be addressed or even get a response.)<br><br>My understanding (based on the draft name and shepherd writeup) is that<br>this document is intended to Obsolete: <a href="/doc/rfc7482/">RFC 7482</a>.&nbsp; If so, that should be<br>indicated in the header, abstract, and introduction, as (in my<br>understanding) the Gen-ART reviewer pointed out.<br><br>Additionally, the specification of the search path segment in Section<br>3.2 seems to be an attempt to replicate the generic HTTP (or even URI)<br>query string concept, but unfortunately it seems to not quite succeed.<br>Specifically, it says that the "HTTP query string is formed" with a<br>single pair of noun/property and search pattern (separated by equals<br>sign), but a generic query string allows multiple simultaneous queries,<br>as in<br><a href="https://example.com/rdap/domains?nsLdhName=*.example.com&amp;nsIp=192.0.2.1">https://example.com/rdap/domains?nsLdhName=*.example.com&amp;nsIp=192.0.2.1</a><br>It seems that we may be inadvertently in conflict with the foundational<br>protocol specification here, and I'm not sure if there are mitigating<br>factors that make it okay to limit to a single query parameter in a<br>divergence from the core HTTP behavior.<br><br>Also, for Section 2, <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a> has an updated <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> boilerplate text to<br>use.<br><br>On to the nits...<br><br>Throughout, we use a four-hex-digit representation of ASCII characters<br>(e.g., "US-ASCII value 0x002A").&nbsp; Wouldn't two hex digits suffice?<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The patterns described in this document purposefully do not encompass<br>&nbsp;  all of the methods employed in the WHOIS and other RESTful web<br>&nbsp;  services used by the RIRs and DNRs.&nbsp; The intent of the patterns<br>&nbsp;  described here is to enable queries of:<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br><br>Is the intent to just not offer a replacement for (all of) those, or is<br>there other work to fill the gaps?&nbsp; (Has the landscape changed since <a href="/doc/rfc7482/">RFC<br>7482</a> was published?)&nbsp; I suspect the first answer is to not offer full<br>replacement, given the later paragraph that responses to these queries<br>may continue to reference the other services, but it seems worth<br>checking.<br><br>&nbsp;  Likewise, future IETF standards may add additional patterns for<br><br>(nit) maybe s/standards/specifications/?&nbsp; It's a long slog to STD...<br><br>&nbsp;  WHOIS services, in general, are read-only services.&nbsp; Therefore, URL<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>] patterns specified in this document are only applicable to<br>&nbsp;  the HTTP [<a href="/doc/rfc7231/">RFC7231</a>] GET and HEAD methods.<br><br>(side note) HTTP defines "safe" methods that might be a more<br>future-proof characterization, though I don't think there's harm in<br>leaving this alone.&nbsp; (I mention it only due to a pedantic objection to<br>the use of the word "therefore", since the chain of reasoning is<br>arguably incomplete.)<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>].&nbsp; For example, if the base URL is<br>&nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/rdap/">https://example.com/rdap/</a>", all RDAP query URLs will begin with<br>&nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/rdap/">https://example.com/rdap/</a>".<br><br>(editorial) Do we want to say that the examples in the rest of the file<br>assume this value of the base URL?<br><br>&nbsp;  The bootstrap registry does not contain information for query objects<br><br>(nit) This is the first instance of the word "bootstrap" in *this*<br>document (vs <a href="/doc/rfc7484/">RFC 7484</a>), so we are implicitly defining the registry as a<br>"bootstrap registry" unless we push the reader more strongly to read <a href="/doc/rfc7484/">RFC<br>7484</a> before this one.&nbsp; It might be a little friendlier to the reader to<br>introduce the "bootstrap" concept earlier and/or separately, e.g., as<br>part of introducing the registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  For help, a base URL is retrieved for any service (domain, address,<br>&nbsp;  etc.) for which additional information is required.&nbsp; The query URL is<br>&nbsp;  constructed by concatenating the base URL to the help path segment<br>&nbsp;  specified in Section 3.1.6.<br><br>nit: I suggest s/concatenating ... to/concatenating ... with/, since the<br>"to" form seems to leave the help path segment as the primary subject of<br>the expression (which might lead the reader to think that it should go<br>first).<br><br>Section 3.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The following URL would be used to find information describing 4-byte<br>&nbsp;  Autonomous System number 65538:<br><br>(side note) Is the distinction between 2- and 4-byte AS numbers useful<br>to make anymore?<br><br>Section 3.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  XXXX is a search pattern representing the "fn" property of an entity<br>&nbsp;  (such as a contact, registrant, or registrar) name as described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 5.1 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-regext-rfc7483bis/">I-D.ietf-regext-rfc7483bis</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(nit) 7483bis seems to not actually define the "fn" property, instead<br>deferring to jCard (<a href="/doc/rfc7095/">RFC 7095</a>), which in turn defers to vCard (<a href="/doc/rfc6350/">RFC 6350</a>),<br>which is perhaps a bit long of a reference chain to ask the reader to<br>follow.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Partial string searching uses the asterisk ('*', US-ASCII value<br>&nbsp;  0x002A) character to match zero or more trailing characters.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  character string representing a domain label suffix MAY be<br>&nbsp;  concatenated to the end of the search pattern to limit the scope of<br>&nbsp;  the search.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As written, this seems like it would allow a domain label suffix to be<br>concatenated to the end of (e.g.) an entity or full-name search, which<br>seems a bit bizzare.&nbsp; Not wrong per se, just ... surprising.<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients SHOULD NOT submit a partial match search of Unicode<br>&nbsp;  characters where a Unicode character may be legally combined with<br>&nbsp;  another Unicode character or characters.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: I suggest clarifying which of "a Unicode character" and "another<br>Unicode character or characters" are in the literal sent by the client<br>and which are to be in the asterisk expansion.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp;

The authors addressed the feedback in the latest draft. Finally, the WG members agreed about elevating the document to "Internet Standard" status considering that no substantial changes were made to <a href="/doc/rfc7482/">RFC 7482</a> and the document included both significant and mature implementations.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document quality is high. It includes a significant number of implementations that are representative of RDAP stakeholders.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Mario Loffredo (<a href="mailto:mario.loffredo@iit.cnr.it">mario.loffredo@iit.cnr.it</a>)<br>Area Director: Barry Leiba (<a href="mailto:barryleiba@gmail.com">barryleiba@gmail.com</a>)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document shepherd has reviewed the document in detail, has actively joined the WG discussion about feedback, has verified that concepts described in this document are both theoretically well-founded and technically feasible through a test implementation.<br>The Shepherd considers the document ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No. The document has been carefully and extensively reviewed by WG members.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No. The document already accounts for IDNs in dealing with RDAP queries on domains and nameservers.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No concerns. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>N/A<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been submitted.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There was a strong WG consensus for the changes made to the existing <a href="/doc/rfc7482/">RFC 7482</a> in this draft. There were other suggestions for changes, but those did not reach consensus and are hence not included in the draft.<br><br>A second Extended WGLC was requested to review the maturity level of the document in order to elevate it from “Proposed Standard” to "Internet Standard” status according to the process described in <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC6410</a>. In the first WGLC, the WG members had merely reviewed the document as "Proposed Standard" because it was not clear that the authors intended to propose it as "Internet Standard". <br>The second WGLC that asked specifically for the review of the elevation requirements got a strong consensus which indicated strong support for the elevation of this document to “Internet Standard”<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.
