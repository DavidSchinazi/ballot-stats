At the same time, we should not preclude<br>| eating it.<br>|<br>| However, I would also note that the homenet charter has something to say<br>| on this topic, and I don't believe this document should be at variance<br>| with what the charter says.<br>|<br>| I think the resolution of this issue is to remove this discussion from <br>| the document. It really has nothing to do with the architecture.<br><br>You originally said:<br>&gt; - have left 3.1.1 in, marked as an open issue (one to be raised in the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; session this week).&nbsp; This principle has had consensus in the WG<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; from the outset.<br><br>Mark said:<br>&gt; I agree that the current text could use improvement, perhaps borrowing<br>&gt; more from what is in the charter already. We can talk about that in our<br>&gt; homenet meeting.<br><br>You have now said:<br>&gt; I understand what you're saying here, but this text has been in the<br>&gt; document pretty much as-is since its first version, for 2+ years, when<br>&gt; it was agreed in the Philadelphia interim meeting, and has not drawn<br>&gt; any comments to remove it previously.&nbsp; So we assume consensus<br>&gt; remains on it being there.<br><br>That bugs me :-)<br>Me: The text is unclear<br>You: Yes, but we have consensus on it<br>I have to say, having consensus does not make it magically any clearer!<br><br>Let me restate my point (which I don't think is a large point, but one that will<br>guide how the WG operates as it works on this topic).<br>If the text intended to say:<br>- If there is an existing protocol that can be used, prefer to use it.<br>- If there is no such existing protocol, use a new or emerging one.<br>- Make no design decisions that make it impossible to use a new or<br>&nbsp; emerging protocol.<br>...then simple rewording can make the difference.<br><br>But charter says:<br> The group will apply existing protocols to handle the five <br> requirements above. For prefix configuration, existing protocols are <br> likely sufficient, and at worst may need some small enhancements, such <br> as new options. For automatic routing, it is expected that existing <br> routing protocols can be used as is, however, a new mechanism may be <br> needed in order to turn a selected protocol on by default<br>...and you can't rewrite your charter in an RFC!<br><br>So, how about...<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  It is desirable to reuse existing protocols where possible, but at<br>&nbsp;  the same time to avoid consciously precluding the introduction of new<br>&nbsp;  or emerging protocols.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Existing protocols will be used to meet the requirements of home<br>&nbsp;  networks. Where necessary, extensions will be made to those<br>&nbsp;  protocols. When no existing protocol is found to be suitable, a<br>&nbsp;  new or emerging protocol may be used. Therefore, it is important<br>&nbsp;  that no design or architectural decisions are made that would<br>&nbsp;  preclude the use of new or emerging protocols.<br>END<br><br>Now, I could live with that despite my philosophical debate with Mark about<br>whether the discussion of which protocols to use belongs in the architecture<br>document, because at least my proposed text brings the topic back to the<br>architecture. (Personally, I think architectures are abstract and functional so<br>they don't mention more than the existence and purpose of protocols.)<br><br>=============<br><br>| 3.5 says...<br>|<br>| As per prefix delegation, it is assumed that a single routing<br>| solution is in use in the homenet architecture.&nbsp; If there is an<br>| identified need to support multiple solutions, these must be<br>| interoperable.<br>|<br>| ...which is internally inconsistent (either there is one solution or<br>| not) and in conflict with the discussion of LLNs within the home.<br><br>You suggested later that <br><br>&gt; - the LLN interoperability would presumably come from a gateway<br>&gt; between the 'regular' homenet and the LLN.<br><br>...and maybe that is what you mean by "interoperable" in this context. If so...<br><br>s/these must be interoperable/it must be possible to achieve interworking<br>through the use of a gateway function/<br><br>(We normally say that two implementations are interoperable when they can speak<br>to each other on the wire.)<br><br>But let's unpick this a bit.<br>You say "a single routing solution is in use in the homenet architecture." You<br>do not say "a single routing solution is in use in any given homenet."<br>There is a big implication here that, for example, there will not be support by<br>the Homenet WG for both OSPF and ISIS solutions. How will the WG choose?<br><br>==============<br><br>| 3.5 says some odd things<br>|<br>|&nbsp; It is desirable, but not absolutely<br>|&nbsp; required, that the routing protocol be able to give a complete view<br>|&nbsp; of the network, and that it be able to pass around more than just<br>|&nbsp; routing information.<br>|<br>| I should think it highly undesirable that the routing protocol be <br>| able to give a complete view of the network. That is neither something<br>| that is the job of a routing protocol, nor something that is good to do<br>| to low-capacity devices be they routers or hosts.<br>|<br>| We can also have a philosophical discussion if you like about whether a<br>| routing protocol should be employed to pass around non-routing <br>| information. Such a use, either by flooding or by more direct means, is<br>| likely to make the routing aspects of the routing protocol slower to <br>| converge and more expensive to run.<br>|<br>| This seems to be in conflict with 3.3.3's preference to avoid flooding<br>| and burning of scarce resources.<br>|<br>| This issue might be resolved by separating out the requirements/desires<br>| in terms of functions (we want to be able to get information between<br>| nodes in a p2p, p2mp, or broadcast way) from how it is achieved (through<br>| routing).<br><br>You said:<br>&gt; - the "complete view' part has been extensively (as in probably 100+ emails)<br>&gt; discussed; I'd be wary of reawakening that if we changed it...<br><br>I have no fear.<br>"Complete view" is clearly not what is intended. You do not want to know the<br>shoe size of the stand-in network operator's third child by his first marriage.<br>So this could be qualified, and easily. For example: "Using information<br>distributed through the routing protocol, each node in the homenet should be<br>able to build a graph of the topology of the whole homenet including links,<br>nodes, connectivity, and link metrics."<br><br>Then you added:<br>&gt; This currently says:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"It is desirable, but not absolutely required, that the routing protocol be<br>&gt; able to give a complete view of the network, and that it be able to<br>&gt; pass around more than just routing information."<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That still leaves room for a separate configuration protocol; there has<br>&gt; been list discussion about this.<br><br>I am not worried that you would preclude a separate configuration protocol. I am<br>not worried that you would preclude a separate management protocol. I *am*<br>worried that you will overload your routing protocol using it for the<br>distribution of other *arbitrary* information not related to routing. As I say,<br>this is contrary to your desire not to burn scarce resources (especially since<br>the use of a flooding protocol seems to be in vogue for the solutioneers).<br><br>It is also something that the Routing Area has come to see as risky. Routing<br>protocol implementations are built with assumptions of network size and network<br>information. We have learned that, as these parameters change, implementations<br>and even protocols become unstable.<br><br>It would really help if the architecture, instead of saying "we could shuffle<br>this information (although we're not quite sure what it is) using the routing<br>protocol" said "we have identified the following types of information that need<br>to be moved around the network from these nodes to those nodes." It could then<br>go on to give advice about which are the appropriate types of mechanism for each<br>type of information</div></td>

Even though this document is labeled an architecture, I am concerned when I see seemingly random requirements documented in various parts of the document.&nbsp; Are there a concrete set of requirements that can be documented in a standalone section (ideally with some justifications)?<br><br>2. Section 1.1 (and other parts of the draft) talks about borders &amp; realms and their impact on forwarding unicast and multicast traffic.&nbsp; I am concerned that these two terms need to be scoped properly to bring them in line with the <a href="/doc/rfc4007/">RFC 4007</a>, specifically the definition of scopes &amp; zones (section 5 of 4007).&nbsp; Of note, this draft says those types of boundaries need to be automagically created, yet 4007 specifically states that boundaries between zones must be configured by an administrator.<br><br>3. The introduction states that this draft is focused on the internals of the homenet "and thus specific features on the WAN side of the CER are out of scope".&nbsp; However, section 2.6 discusses transition scenarios that are already defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6204/">RFC 6204</a> (6204bis).&nbsp; What is the purpose of having transition text in *this* draft?<br><br>5. Does the discussion of walled gardens in section 3.2.4 (next-to-last paragraph) need an explicit reference to section 4.2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc3002/">RFC 3002</a>?&nbsp; The guidance provided in 3002 is very explicit and I would not want homenet to go against that consensus.<br><br>6. This is more of a general concern, but I am seeing a lot of zero-config magic being wished for in this document.&nbsp; While it is a noble goal, I don't see how it dovetails with other aspects such as home vs. guest subnets, device enrollments vs. unmodified hosts, and the need for policies in some scenarios.&nbsp; There are some aspects of a complex network that require some level of human intervention to get right.&nbsp; How would a router know that an attached subnet should be treated as the guest subnet?&nbsp; How does a router know that a particular upstream link is to a corporate VPN?<br><br>7. I think it is inappropriate to discuss IPv6 address allocation policies in section 3.4.1.&nbsp; The fourth paragraph in that section is on dangerous grounds trying to mandate what an ISP allocates to a customer.<br><br>8. Section 3.6.5 seems rather odd to me.&nbsp; Trusting a packet's source address to be correct and use it to affect security settings seems questionable.&nbsp; Especially if it is based on an assumption that border filters are in place and operational.&nbsp; What is the genesis/basis for this text?</div></td>

However, it is a real<br>cause of loss of function and capability in the home network. <a href="/doc/rfc6724/">RFC 6724</a><br>does nothing to ease this because, although it may give advice about<br>selecting a source address, it doesn't handle the case where a device<br>wishes to change its source address.<br><br>A multi-homed home needs to be flexible and resilient. It also needs to<br>support mobility within the home as well as from outside the home into<br>the home. Such resilience and mobility need to be achieved without<br>service disruption and at the network layer.<br><br>SA-based routing is only a sticking plaster since, while it gets the<br>packets to the right CER based on their SA, it doesn't help when the<br>SA needs to be changed.<br><br>The home should become part of the Internet, not a wart on the side, and<br>IP packets should be dynamically routable without the need to ask the <br>sender to change the source address.

It would be better if the document was <br>clearer about the solution model that needs to be applied (section 2.3)<br>is pretty much clear enough, and if it left all resolution of the <br>problem out of scope of this document. If routing changes are needed,<br>perhaps these could be determined within the Routing Area. If<br>operational changes are acceptable, perhaps the Ops Area could make a<br>determination. In short, this document is too open to the passing<br>opinions of how things might be done, and once that has been made into<br>an RFC it will be really hard to do something different.<br><br>This issue (of the document making suggested solutions) may be more <br>general (for example, the end of 3.3.1, or the end of 3.4.3), I just<br>feel it more around routing.<br><br>I think this issue could be resolved by careful grooming of the text so<br>that it describes the requirements (if they exist) such as a host must<br>be able to choose between different addresses and <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> must be assumed<br>to be in use.

Such a use, either by flooding or by more direct means, is<br>likely to make the routing aspects of the routing protocol slower to <br>converge and more expensive to run.<br><br>This seems to be in conflict with 3.3.3's preference to avoid flooding<br>and burning of scarce resources.<br><br>This issue might be resolved by separating out the requirements/desires<br>in terms of functions (we want to be able to get information between<br>nodes in a p2p, p2mp, or broadcast way) from how it is achieved (through<br>routing).<br><br>---<br><br>3.8.2 is an ambitious punt. While there is clearly no need for active<br>configuration management, diagnostics will be required.

Why would you say this an not observe how IS-IS <br>is able to self-configure? Suggest deleting the solution-specific stuff.<br><br>---<br><br>There is no discussion in 3.5 of preferring links or path lengths.

Should self-configuration include assigning<br>metrics according to node/link capabilities? <br><br>---<br><br>It is unclear to me whether 3.5.2 is a statement about routing (it is in<br>section 3.5) or about a more general attribute such that the section <br>should be placed elsewhere.<br><br>BTW, why say "(wireless)"?

None of these rise to the level of requiring a DISCUSSion; t is, after all, just Informational. However, please take these into consideration, and I'd appreciate answers to the queries:<br><br>1.1: You define LLN here. But throughout the document, sometimes you use LLN to mean "home automation device network" (see 2.1 below), where the network might not necessarily be low-power or lossy, and sometimes you truly mean LLN. I suggest you look through the document and make sure you identify which are which. (For example, in 2.4, I don't think you're really talking about LLNs; you're talking about home automation networks.)<br><br>There's no need for a definition for UPnP here. It is only cited once (in 3.6.1), and even there it's simply an example. (I'm not at all clear why this document, even in 3.6.1, has to advertise for UPnP, a non-IETF technology. I'd rather the example simply be removed from 3.6.1 and stick to PCP.)<br><br>You refer to "guest" networks throughout the document, but don't define it here. I find the concept a bit odd myself; I know many corporations have a concept of a guest network, but it's rare for home networks to have such a thing. Can you explain why this is a useful construct in a home network? If it turns out to be, it's probably worth defining here.<br><br>2.1. Instead of "building control", please use the term "home automation" here. "Home automation" encompasses more than "building control" for homes, and "building control" includes things that are not part of home networking. By the way: It is a home automation (or building control) "network" or "subnet", not a home automation "extension", isn't it?<br><br>The use of the word "extension" here and elsewhere (as in "corporate extension" or "extension network") is nothing I've heard used before and it is undefined in this document. In the context of a corporate network, don't you simply mean a "corporate virtual (private?) network"? Or are you really talking about the possibility of corporations providing a dedicated network in a home premise that might be interconnected with the user's ISP and home automation networks?<br><br>2.4: I think you're simply talking about home automation devices here, not LLNs.<br><br>2.5: (Tilting at a windmill) Zeroconf and simple naming are really only useful for ULAs. To avoid the need for manual configuration of GUAs, the ability to configure DDNS (i.e., giving the user the ability to type in a domain name and have it update the AAAA record with the auto-configured address) must be provided. (See also 3.7.3 below.)<br><br>3.1.2: This section seems a little thin, and frankly I can't figure out what it really means: Certainly few home CERs nowadays allow you to plug them into other home CERs from different providers and have anything useful happen, so saying that changes to routers needs to be "minimized" seems unrealistic. Sure, you won't be making wholesale changes to IPv6, but this section seems to be saying something different. What do you mean by "minimized"?<br><br>3.2.2.1: What's the interest of Link F? The Interior Router looks like it's linked to the CER through Network E already. Does having F separate mean anything in particular?<br><br>You mention that B and E are "bridged". Is that any different than in figure 2, where the two CERs are bridged across a single network?<br><br>3.2.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  ...it is important not<br>&nbsp;  to introduce new IPv6 capabilities that would cause a failure if used<br>&nbsp;  alongside IPv4+NAT...<br><br>Are there examples of what you're thinking of here?<br><br>3.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  The home network architecture should be naturally self-organising and<br>&nbsp;  self-configuring under different circumstances relating to the<br>&nbsp;  connectivity status to the Internet, number of devices, and physical<br>&nbsp;  topology.&nbsp; At the same time, it should be possible for advanced users<br>&nbsp;  to manually adjust (override) the current configuration.<br><br>The architecture is not "self-configuring" or configurable. I think you mean that homenet (routing?) *devices* need to be self-configuring and that advanced uses be able to override their configurations. If not, please explain.<br><br>3.4.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  ...it is recommended that the receiving router instead enters an error<br>&nbsp;  state and issues appropriate warnings.<br>&nbsp;  <br>That sure sounds like a recommendation designed to be ignored. You are either saying that manufacturers should make equipment that will fail to function in certain circumstances, or you're encouraging the creation of a "HOMENET certified" brand. Neither one seems like a good thing.<br><br>The last 5 paragraphs of this section strike me as a bit odd: The norm for homenets (from the earlier discussion) seems to be that it must handle users plugging together of devices from different providers and removal of those devices from the network. It seems like handling *that* gracefully will make all issues of renumbering/prefix changes/new ISP/etc. simply degenerate cases of the bigger issue of dealing with networks being plugged together and unplugged randomly.<br><br>3.5.2: This seems a bit hand-wavy. Perhaps that's the best that can be done in this document.<br><br>3.7.3: This section is a bit thin on how global name spaces will work. If homenets are going to have global name spaces, the authoritative server you mention in the first paragraph is going to almost certainly be a DDNS server, and changes are going to be needed on the hosts to support this. We certainly *do* want printers and other services to keep their names up to date with different GUAs coming and going. I think a discussion of this would be useful.</div></td>

Even though this document is labeled an architecture, I am concerned when I see seemingly random requirements documented in various parts of the document.&nbsp; Are there a concrete set of requirements that can be documented in a standalone section (ideally with some justifications)?<br><br>2. Section 1.1 (and other parts of the draft) talks about borders &amp; realms and their impact on forwarding unicast and multicast traffic.&nbsp; I am concerned that these two terms need to be scoped properly to bring them in line with the <a href="/doc/rfc4007/">RFC 4007</a>, specifically the definition of scopes &amp; zones (section 5 of 4007).&nbsp; Of note, this draft says those types of boundaries need to be automagically created, yet 4007 specifically states that boundaries between zones must be configured by an administrator.<br><br>3. The introduction states that this draft is focused on the internals of the homenet "and thus specific features on the WAN side of the CER are out of scope".&nbsp; However, section 2.6 discusses transition scenarios that are already defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6204/">RFC 6204</a> (6204bis).&nbsp; What is the purpose of having transition text in *this* draft?<br><br>4. While I fully support open-source software and recognize its benefit to the IETF, I do not find it appropriate to espouse (borderline require) its use in an architecture document.&nbsp; The text in section 3 and 3.5 is rather inappropriate in this context.<br><br>5. Does the discussion of walled gardens in section 3.2.4 (next-to-last paragraph) need an explicit reference to section 4.2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc3002/">RFC 3002</a>?&nbsp; The guidance provided in 3002 is very explicit and I would not want homenet to go against that consensus.<br><br>6. This is more of a general concern, but I am seeing a lot of zero-config magic being wished for in this document.&nbsp; While it is a noble goal, I don't see how it dovetails with other aspects such as home vs. guest subnets, device enrollments vs. unmodified hosts, and the need for policies in some scenarios.&nbsp; There are some aspects of a complex network that require some level of human intervention to get right.&nbsp; How would a router know that an attached subnet should be treated as the guest subnet?&nbsp; How does a router know that a particular upstream link is to a corporate VPN?<br><br>7. I think it is inappropriate to discuss IPv6 address allocation policies in section 3.4.1.&nbsp; The fourth paragraph in that section is on dangerous grounds trying to mandate what an ISP allocates to a customer.<br><br>8. Section 3.6.5 seems rather odd to me.&nbsp; Trusting a packet's source address to be correct and use it to affect security settings seems questionable.&nbsp; Especially if it is based on an assumption that border filters are in place and operational.&nbsp; What is the genesis/basis for this text?</div></td>

I'm pretty sure I know what you mean, but I didn't see a definition or reference. Could one or both be provided?<br><br>In 3.3.4.&nbsp; Homenet realms and borders<br><br>&nbsp;  It is expected that a realm would span at least an entire subnet, and<br>&nbsp;  thus the borders lie at routers which receive delegated prefixes<br>&nbsp;  within the homenet.&nbsp; It is also desirable, for a richer security<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  model, that hosts are able to make communication decisions based on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  available realm and associated prefix information in the same way<br>&nbsp;  that routers at realm borders can.<br><br>and in 3.6.4.&nbsp; Device capabilities<br><br>&nbsp;  In terms of the devices, homenet hosts should implement their own<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  security policies in accordance to their computing capabilities.<br>&nbsp;  They should have the means to request transparent communications to<br>&nbsp;  be able to be initiated to them through security filters in the<br>&nbsp;  homenet, either for all ports or for specific services.&nbsp; Users should<br>&nbsp;  have simple methods to associate devices to services that they wish<br>&nbsp;  to operate transparently through (CER) borders.<br><br>I wonder if the places where you have expectations about hosts could be gathered into a single higher-level section ("considerations for hosts in homenets", or something). In the current version of the draft, they're buried in descriptions about homenets, and I wonder whether the people who need to see them will actually see them. and you don't have very many of them. I wouldn't expect much text to change (the expectations are clearly stated).

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br>&nbsp; <br>A:&nbsp; The goal of this document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and requirements.&nbsp; The text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.&nbsp; The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.&nbsp; It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.&nbsp; There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>A: The general architectural principles appear to be well supported and understood.&nbsp; Whilst there have been some controversial discussions within the WG, those have tended to be around potential future implementation decisions rather than with the architecture as a whole.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>A: There have been two formal WG last calls, with a number of reviewers. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>A: Ray Bellis, Ted Lemon<br> <br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>A: Document has been reviewed by a number of individuals, the WG Area Director, 100s of emails exchanged, and 10 versions over 2.5 years. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>A: No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>A: Homenet is widely attended and has a large email subscriber base, but, no, we have not reached out for a community-specific review. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>A: The shepherd has no specific concerns.&nbsp; The responsible area director has followed this group closely. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>A: Written confirmation has been received from all authors.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>A: There have been no disclosures filed against this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>A: The WG chairs believe the consensus on what is in this document is not unanimous, but is solid. Areas of concern have been discussed at length, wordsmithed, and general agreement achieved. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>A: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>A: Yes - part of the tool submission<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>A: N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>A: Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>A: No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br><br>A: No.<br><br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>A: N/A<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>A: N/A<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>A: N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>A: N/A</div></td>
