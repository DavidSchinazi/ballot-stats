Only change is to intended status.*<br><br>The most important thing to note about these drafts (this one and its<br>companion) is that they are the last items for the homenet WG - the WG has been<br>moribund for some time but the authors and AD are keen to get these drafts<br>published, for the record and so they could be a basis for further work and<br>possible deployment. While the activity level of the WG is such that one can't<br>claim a broad consensus, over the years this work has been in progress, the<br>drafts have gotten sufficient review and there was no objection to the plan to<br>publish them when the AD proposed doing so on the WG list in April 2022.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>Bit of both. The author team have dilligently progressed<br>the work, with review from WG participants over the years.<br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>No particular controversy.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>No.<br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br><br>N/A.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>N/A.<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>N/A.<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>The document is ready.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>N/A.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Experimental. (Following IETF LC and IEST discussion.)<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>No known IPR issues. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>In progress: DM, MR and RW responded so far. <br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>idnits is happy.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>No.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>N/A.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>There are some downrefs to fix. It looks like all should be fine<br>as informative references:<br><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc4192/">RFC 4192</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc6092/">RFC 6092</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7010/">RFC 7010</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7084/">RFC 7084</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC 7368</a><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7707/">RFC 7707</a><br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>N/A, other than the companion draft being progressed alongside this.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>All good.<br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>N/A.<br><br><br></div></td>

Unless it would use DNS catalog zones, eg<br>draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-catalog-zones.<br><br>Information on how to convey the name to be used as Public Homenet Zone<br>should be added to Section 6.1.<br><br>#4 HNA IP address<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result, the HNA must provide the IP address the DM should use to reach the HNA.<br><br>Note there is an odd lowercase "must" here, which becomes stranger when later on it states:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By default, the IP address used by the HNA in the Control Channel<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is considered by the DM and the explicit specification of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP by the HNA is only OPTIONAL.<br><br>So it seems the HNA doesn't need to "must provide", as its IP as visible by the DM/DOI is<br>used anyway and providing it (explicitly) is deemed OPTIONAL ?</div></td>

Either this locks in where users can host their homenet zone<br>based on CPE preconfiguration, or it is just a fancy way of saying "configure your DNS<br>server with your remote DNS settings" (which would not need anything of this document to run,<br>and I was hoping this document was going to provide some automation for this?)<br><br>&nbsp;  The HNA SHOULD provide the hash of the KSK (DS RRset), so the DOI<br>&nbsp;  provides this value to the parent zone.&nbsp; A common deployment use case<br>&nbsp;  is that the DOI is the registrar of the Registered Homenet Domain and<br>&nbsp;  as such, its relationship with the registry of the parent zone<br>&nbsp;  enables it to update the parent zone.<br><br>This now means that the solution is limited to those scenarios that have:<br>- CPE support for homenet RFCs<br>- ISP support for CPE for HNA for DOI that supports DNSSEC DS submission via EPP, or<br>- A Registrar that is also DNS hoster AND supports DNSSEC AND supports CDS/CDNSKEY AND supports AXFR/IXFR<br>&nbsp; AND supports homenet RFCs<br><br><br>I would argue these requirements are far more restrictive than:<br>- CPE with support for stock Dynamic DNS updates for itself only (eg client registrations,<br>&nbsp; but could also be autoatic conversion of MDNS/.local to its local homenet zone.<br>- CPE that can run recursive with an authoritative zone<br>- Any DNS hoster that supports AXFR/IXFR, DNSSEC and CDS/CDNSKEY<br>- Any Register that supports DNSSEC<br><br>with the only difference that the latter one needs a one step registration of the initial DS record.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Though the HNA may also later directly update the values of the DS<br>&nbsp;  via the Control Channel, it is RECOMMENDED to use other mechanisms<br>&nbsp;  such as CDS and CDNSKEY [<a href="/doc/rfc7344/">RFC7344</a>] for transparent updates during key<br>&nbsp;  roll overs.<br><br>If this is going to be a fully automated enduser CPE solution, this RECOMMENDED<br>is too weak. It should be a MUST because otherwise DNSSEC rollover is just impossible.<br><br><br>Section 4<br><br>this all seems to imply "registered domains". Can these be subdomains? Eg can I own <a href="http://nohats.ca">nohats.ca</a><br>and configure one CPE for <a href="http://toronto.nohats.ca">toronto.nohats.ca</a>. and the other for <a href="http://amsterdam.nohats.ca">amsterdam.nohats.ca</a>. ? This involves<br>talking to NS for <a href="http://nohats.ca">nohats.ca</a> for sub delegation, but I don't see that mentioned anywhere ?<br><br>Section 4.5.1<br><br>How would the bootstrap work. I pick "<a href="http://paulhomenet.com">paulhomenet.com</a>" as my zone, but then my CPE doens't have<br>nameservers for it, so it does AXFR via the Control Channel ? And get a set of NS records back<br>that my CPE adds to <a href="http://paulhomenet.com">paulhomenet.com</a> ? And then it becomes authoritative? How is the ownership<br>of <a href="http://paulhomenet.com">paulhomenet.com</a> tested? if it is registered, who will be the registrar, registrant? Is ".io"<br>supported? Or other TLDs? Or will this all be under "<a href="http://nameyoupick.homenet.cpevender.com">nameyoupick.homenet.cpevender.com</a>" ?<br><br>AXFR is normally based on authentication of domain name plus shared key. How does that work when<br>creating a _new_ domain name by the enduser? How can this be authenticated without knowing the<br>zone name ?<br><br>Section 4.5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The default IP address used by the HNA for the Synchronization<br>&nbsp;  Channel is the IP address of the Control Channel.&nbsp; To provide a<br>&nbsp;  different IP address, the HNA MAY send a DNS UPDATE message.<br><br>What does this DNS UPDATE message contain? It says NS records but what<br>name? And as this is the authoritative server sending an DMS UPDATE<br>message, it would need to send the RRSIG too, which means it needs to<br>set the entire NS RRset? Which means it needs to know the remote NS<br>records, but how can it do that without first already using the proper<br>IP address to talk to the systems?<br><br>Section 4.5.4:<br><br>If a deletion is processed, what happens with the domain name? Will all<br>its NS records be deleted and it is now a lame delegation? How is the enduser<br>supposed to get their domain under their own control again? Is it ever truly<br>theirs?<br><br><br>4.6 Securing the control channel<br><br>Isn't this channel DNS dynamic updates? Are these not secured by TSIG/SIG0 ?<br>Did you mean TLS only for privacy considerations and not security considerations?<br><br>Apparently this is not the case?<br><br>&nbsp;  A pure DNS solution using TSIG and/or SIG(0) to authenticate message<br>&nbsp;  was also considered.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;  A way to translate this OAUTH2 token from HTTPS web space to DNS SIG(0)<br>&nbsp;  space seems overly problematic,<br><br>Why not use TSIG? That is literally the keyed hash of a blob, and the blob can<br>be an OAUTH2 token ?<br><br>ection 4.7<br><br>&nbsp;  Interface Binding:&nbsp; the Hidden Primary Server will almost certainly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; listen on the WAN Interface, whereas a regular Homenet<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authoritative Servers would listen on the internal home network<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interface.<br><br>Does that matter if either one provides a routable public IPv6 address?<br><br>&nbsp;  Limited exchanges:&nbsp; the purpose of the Hidden Primary Server is to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; synchronize with the DM, not to serve any zones to end users, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the public Internet.<br><br>I thought it was serving endusers so that local things would keep working<br>with a broken internet link? Or at least "serve" its "resolver" part. And<br>also serve as auth server to take in DNS Dynamic Updates?<br><br>Section 5:<br><br>&nbsp;  Uploading and dynamically updating the zone file on the DM can be<br>&nbsp;  seen as zone provisioning between the HNA (Hidden Primary) and the DM<br>&nbsp;  (Secondary Server).&nbsp; This can be handled via AXFR + DNS UPDATE.<br><br>I don't see how the start of this works, when the end user tells their CPE<br>the name of their local homenet zone ?<br><br>(also I think you mean AXFR/IXFR ? The DNS UPDATE would be the local machine<br> talking to the local CPE ? Not between HNA and DM?)<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that there is no standard way to distribute a DNS primary<br>&nbsp;  between multiple devices.&nbsp; As a result, if multiple devices are<br>&nbsp;  candidate for hosting the Hidden Primary, some specific mechanisms<br>&nbsp;  should be designed so the home network only selects a single HNA for<br>&nbsp;  the Hidden Primary.&nbsp; Selection mechanisms based on HNCP [<a href="/doc/rfc7788/">RFC7788</a>] are<br>&nbsp;  good candidates.<br><br>This seems rather under specified. If there is only one, how is it found and<br>used? I was expecting that the domainname configured on the CPE would be<br>queried for DNS UPDATES by clients. But looking at <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a> Section 4:<br><br>&nbsp;  From a requestor's point of view, any authoritative server for<br>&nbsp;  the zone can appear to be able to process update requests, even<br>&nbsp;  though only the primary master server is actually able to modify the<br>&nbsp;  zone's master file.&nbsp; Requestors are expected to know the name of the<br>&nbsp;  zone they intend to update and to know or be able to determine the<br>&nbsp;  name servers for that zone.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the requestor has reasonable cause to believe that all of a<br>&nbsp;  zone's servers will be equally reachable, then it should arrange to<br>&nbsp;  try the primary master server (as given by the SOA MNAME field if<br>&nbsp;  matched by some NS NSDNAME<br><br>This would be only one possible target based on the domainname given to<br>a device via DHCP. What "some specific mechanism should be designed" will<br>be deployed for the clients (eg my phones, laptop and TV ?) I think the<br>only real chance they have of doing this (without waiting 10 years for<br>all our electronics to cycle/get updated) is standard the SOA MNAME's IP<br>address, eg <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC 2136</a> DNS Dynamic Updates. My devices already support this.<br><br>So that redefines the above problem to "Who becomes the Hidden Primary",<br>which I assumed was the CPE supporting this framework ? And if there<br>are more than one CPE that can do this, it should be configured by<br>the user to be done only by one CPE - similar to have a user should<br>ensure there is only one DHCP server running in the network ?<br><br>Section 5:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First the HNA (primary) notifies the DM (secondary)<br><br>The entire document would have been so much more readable if HNA and DM<br>had not been introduced and primary/secondary was used througout.<br><br>&nbsp;  The HNA SHOULD apply an ACL on inbound AXFR requests to ensure they<br>&nbsp;  only arrive from the DM Synchronization Channel.<br><br>Unless the CPE is preconfiguted with service providers, these ACLs cannot<br>come by default? Also, if this channel uses TSIG (which also needs preconfiguration)<br>then it can already ACL this based on the known shared secret. No IP based<br>ACLs needed (which are risky to put into CPE firmware as networks change)<br><br>Section 7:<br><br>Why can't the HNA be the local authoritative server for clients? Why should<br>this functionality be split in two? It just means another recursive resolver<br>needs to query the HNA (and have it configured as forwarder) for the local<br>homenet zone (in case uplink goes down). For example, this could be a single<br>instance of the Bind DNS server dong both authoritative and recursive DNS.<br><br>Dropping received queries for DNS servers is always a bad idea, as it just<br>causes the client to retransmit. Always returning an error is the common<br>DNS reply strategy. This section goes against common best practise for DNS<br>servers.<br><br>Section 9:<br><br>&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC7368</a>] in Section 3.7.3 recommends DNSSEC to be deployed on both<br>&nbsp;  the authoritative server and the resolver.&nbsp; The resolver side is out<br>&nbsp;  of scope of this document, and only the authoritative part of the<br>&nbsp;  server is considered.<br><br>But if things must work without an internet connection working, then the<br>resolver needs to be configured for the homenet domain to ask the HNA<br>and not go the regular upstream path. So it should be in scope I believe.<br><br>&nbsp;  Typically, the DS RRset can be updated<br>&nbsp;  manually in the parent zone with nsupdate for example.<br><br>I don't think this applies to "typical DS". The DS RRset lives on the "wrong"<br>side of the zone cut. A dns update client is would not have permissions to<br>update its parent zone with dns updates, only its own child zone. So this<br>would be better done by pushing a CDS record and let the parent pull the CDS<br>and recreate its own DS record. This method is not widely supported by TLDs,<br>and I dont know how this solution would work for second or third level domains,<br>eg if I use provider X to host <a href="http://nohats.ca">nohats.ca</a>, and provider Y for my home internet<br>and I want <a href="http://toronto.nohats.ca">toronto.nohats.ca</a> to be my home network name using CPE vendor Z.<br><br>Section 10:<br><br>&nbsp;  The ISP SHOULD ensure that the DNS cache has expired before re-<br>&nbsp;  assigning the prefix to a new home network.<br><br>How does it do that? It can't send queries to get the data for TTL anymore,<br>since the network already got renumbered and returned and the NS servers<br>removed. The records now only live in worldwide caches. You don't know the TTL.<br>Unless you grabbed the data just before getting it returned. But that is also<br>unlikely, eg imagine a user taking down their CPE because they moved house.<br>From the ISP point of view the network just vanished including all its nameservers<br>for it (the public ones will work for a while but will the ISP act within that time?)<br><br>And what of the CPE/HNA set TTLs on data of 1 year ?<br><br>The TTL math in section 10 makes no sense to me as the CPE/HNA could set it to whatever<br>it wants. The ISPs secondary servers cannot change the TTL (it is protected by DNSSEC<br>from being modified)<br><br>Section 11:<br><br>The Privacy Considerations section is a bit hard to read. But in the end it comes down<br>to "dont make your homenet DNS publicly reachable if you want privacy". Indeed, I find<br>publishing my entire home network into public DNS a serious risk. DNS scanners will end<br>up scanning for well known names of popular brands of TVs, washing machines, saunas,<br>lightbulbs, etc. Or they will start scanning zones based on well known ISP based secondary<br>services. It is almost as if the better solution would be to only provide a publicly reachable<br>homenet VPN server, that provides both DNS and the only working routes from my (remote) devices<br>on my to my home network based devices.<br><br>The privacy and security of the DNS names is a small thing if homenet puts all my devices on<br>the public IPv6 network. Scanning IPv6 is still fairly hard to do, even of endusers /64. And<br>putting those IPv6 addresses in DNS makes it much much easier to find all these devices and<br>use their exposed services to compromise the device and/or network that they are in. These<br>considerations are completely missing from the Security Considerations Section 12.<br><br>Appendix A:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not deal with how the HNA is provisioned with a<br>&nbsp;  trusted relationship to the Distribution Manager for the forward<br>&nbsp;  zone.<br><br>But that is core to the protocol ?<br><br>&nbsp;  Similarly, if the HNA is provided by a registrar, the HNA may be<br>&nbsp;  handed pre-configured to end user.<br><br>How can that be if the user decides on the homenet network name it wants to use?<br><br>Appendix C:<br><br>The example zone used is <a href="http://n8d234f.r.example.net">n8d234f.r.example.net</a>.

It does seem from other hints in the document that the authors consider TLS mandatory even though it's not stated as such in Section 4.6. For example, Security Considerations subsection 12.1 says,<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The channels between HNA and DM are mutually authenticated and<br>&nbsp;  encrypted with TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>] and its associated security<br>&nbsp;  considerations apply. <br>```<br><br>Another hint that TLS is viewed as mandatory-to-implement is from a different document also currently under review, <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options/21/">draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options-21</a> (Sections 4.2 and 4.3):<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bit for DNS over TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>] MUST be set.<br>```<br><br>I talk about this more in my comment on Section 4.6, but there's just no way to read this paragraph as mandating TLS:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Secure protocols (like TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>]) SHOULD be used to secure the<br>&nbsp;  transactions between the DM and the HNA.<br>```<br><br>It doesn't even quite mandate secure transport in general, since it's a SHOULD (so presumably there are times when an implementor can sensibly ignore it, though these are not discussed). What's more, TLS is only given as an example of one transport that would be OK, not as the mandatory-to-implement secure transport. As written, any secure transport, for example TCP-AO, would satisfy this SHOULD.<br><br>Based on the hints throughout the rest of the document set, that the authors think of TLS as the mandatory-to-implement base transport, I think this section should be rewritten to match that expectation.</div></td>

I hope these comments help you get it over the finish line.<br><br>Although I'm not enough of a DNS expert to evaluate the details of what the document specifies, the number of inconsistencies and minor errors I've flagged in my review makes me concerned that there may be problems with implementability.&nbsp; For this reason I support Warren Kumari's DISCUSS.<br><br>In my comments below I've flagged a few grammar nits, but for the most part I've tried to restrict myself to cases where it seemed like there was a risk of misunderstanding if not corrected.&nbsp; Even when/if these are fixed I think the document would benefit from a full go-over either manually or using an automated grammar checker, before sending it to the RFC Editor.&nbsp; (Yes the RFC Editor will do their best to fix all of these.&nbsp; But it's better for the authors to do it to the best of their ability, including because occasionally, despite their best efforts, the RFC Editor introduces a "fix" that results in an unwanted normative change.)<br><br>## COMMENTS<br><br>### Global - "associated to"<br><br>There are at least 13 occurrences of the phrase "associated to".&nbsp; Can these all be replaced by the more idiomatically correct "associated with"?&nbsp; I hesitate, because "associated to" in computing can have a technically-distinct meaning, however if that's the case in any of these I think such uses of "associated to" may need clarification. <br><br>So, to be clear: I suggest either replacing these by "associated with", or if that's inappropriate, clarifying the meaning.<br><br>### Global - SHOULD vs. MUST<br><br>A quick grep shows 32 instances of SHOULD or SHOULD NOT in the document (not counting the two in the boilerplate). I haven't audited each one, but for many of these it's difficult to see why they're SHOULD and not MUST. My own heuristic is to think of SHOULD as a "must/unless" pair -- it's desirable to provide some guidance to the implementator as to what circumstances would justify ignoring the SHOULD. If you can't actually think of good reasons to do that, consider changing the SHOULD to a MUST. Or if you're using SHOULD in the sense of "we think you ought to implement it this way but we are trying to be considerate and not yell MUST at you all the time" it's also reasonable to use lower-case words instead of <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords.<br><br>I won't comment separately on each individual SHOULD in the document but I encourage you to review them.<br><br>### Section 1<br><br>"KSK (DS RRset)"<br><br>Please provide a reference or other hints for those readers who don't speak DNSSEC as a first language (like me). "KSK" could probably use to be expanded on first use, too.<br><br>### Section 1.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  However, since communications<br>&nbsp;  are established with names which remains a global identifier<br>```<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't understand what that clause means.<br><br>### Section 1.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  even adapted to IPv6 and ignoring those associated to an IPv4<br>&nbsp;  development<br>```<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't understand what this clause means.

Re-word?<br><br>### Section 4<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  the IP address and port number to use and protocol to<br>&nbsp;  set secure session<br>```<br>&nbsp;  <br>I don't understand what that clause means (in particular "protocol to set secure session").<br><br>### Section 4.2<br><br>For this text,<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  By accepting the DS RR, the DM commits in taking care of advertising<br>&nbsp;  the DS to the parent zone.&nbsp; Upon refusal, the DM clearly indicates it<br>&nbsp;  does not have the capacity to proceed to the update.<br>```<br><br>Would the below rewrite be correct? If not, please propose another.<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  By accepting the DS RR, the DM commits to advertise<br>&nbsp;  the DS to the parent zone.&nbsp; On the other hand if the DM<br>&nbsp;  does not have the capacity to advertise the DS to the <br>&nbsp;  parent zone, it indicates this by refusing the DS RR.<br>```<br><br>### Section 4.3<br><br>I don't understand what this paragraph is telling me about the provision of the IP address by the HNA:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The HNA works as a primary authoritative DNS server, while the DM<br>&nbsp;  works like a secondary.&nbsp; As a result, the HNA must provide the IP<br>&nbsp;  address the DM is using to reach the HNA.&nbsp; The synchronization<br>&nbsp;  Channel will be set between that IP address and the IP address of the<br>&nbsp;  DM.&nbsp; By default, the IP address used by the HNA in the Control<br>&nbsp;  Channel is considered by the DM and the specification of the IP by<br>&nbsp;  the HNA is only OPTIONAL.&nbsp; The transport channel (including port<br>&nbsp;  number) is the same as the one used between the HNA and the DM for<br>&nbsp;  the Control Channel.<br>```<br><br>You start out by saying the "the HNA must provide the IP address the DM is using to reach the HNA". (By the way when you say "is using" I think you mean "should use". No?) I note the use of "must".<br><br>But then you go on to say that "the specification of the IP by the HNA is only OPTIONAL". (I assume that "the IP" here means "the IP address" that was discussed a few sentences back, probably you should add the word "address" if so.)<br><br>These two sentences, the "must" in the first one and the "OPTIONAL" in the later, seem directly in opposition to one another. :-(<br><br>### Section 4.5.2<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The DM SHOULD ignore non-empty the Pre-requisite and<br>&nbsp;  Additional Data section"<br>```<br><br>I don't know what this means. If "non-empty" weren't there, I would get it, it would just mean "ignore the pre-req and additional data sections no matter what their content is" -- so maybe the easiest fix is to delete "non-empty" (and changing "section" to "sections" while you're at it), as in<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The DM MUST ignore the Pre-requisite and Additional Data<br>&nbsp;  sections, if present.<br>```<br><br>### Section 4.5.2<br><br>These two paragraphs seem a little inconsistent:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  An error indicates the MD does not<br>&nbsp;  update the DS, and other method should be used by the HNA.<br><br>&nbsp;  The regular DNS error message SHOULD be returned to the HNA when an<br>&nbsp;  error occurs.&nbsp; In particular a FORMERR is returned when a format<br>&nbsp;  error is found, this includes when unexpected RRSets are added or<br>&nbsp;  when RRsets are missing.&nbsp; A SERVFAIL error is returned when a<br>&nbsp;  internal error is encountered.&nbsp; A NOTZONE error is returned when<br>&nbsp;  update and Zone sections are not coherent, a NOTAUTH error is<br>&nbsp;  returned when the DM is not authoritative for the Zone section.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  REFUSED error is returned when the DM refuses to proceed to the<br>&nbsp;  configuration and the requested action.<br>```<br> <br>I would have guessed that the implication of some of the errors cited in the second paragraph is that the HNA should correct the problem and then retry.&nbsp; But the first paragraph seems to indicate that an HNA shouldn't bother even considering the error code, because "and other method should be used by the HNA".<br><br>I'm not sure how, or if, to resolve this seeming inconsistency.<br><br>### Section 4.5.3<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Similarly to Section 4.5.2, DNS errors are used and an error<br>&nbsp;  indicates the DM is not configured as a secondary.<br>```<br><br>Related to the previous comment -- is this true regardless of what error code is returned, for example would a FORMERR mean that the DM is not configured as a secondary? <br><br>Even given that any error implies that the operation failed, what if the DM had already been previously configured as secondary, and the operation were merely updating some parameter? Would the previous configuration be voided, as the text currently implies? Or would the DM remain configured as secondary, using the previous configuration?<br><br>### Section 4.6<br><br>These two paragraphs seem inconsistent:<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The control channel between the HNA and the DM MUST be secured at<br>&nbsp;  both the HNA and the DM.<br><br>&nbsp;  Secure protocols (like TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>]) SHOULD be used to secure the<br>&nbsp;  transactions between the DM and the HNA.<br>```<br><br>MUST the channel be secured?&nbsp; Or is it only SHOULD?&nbsp; Also, does the second paragraph really mean "secure *transport* protocols", or is the ambiguity intentional?&nbsp; By ambiguity, I suppose the paragraph as written might be satisfied by object-level security, for instance, and for that matter it leaves it up to the reader to even define exactly what they mean by "security". Finally, see also my DISCUSS comments -- if you actually want to mandate TLS (as implied by some of the other parts of this document, and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options/21/">draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options-21</a>), you need to make some changes to this section.<br><br>### Section 4.6<br><br>Please expand SAN on first use.<br><br>### Section 7<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Depending how the communications between the HNA and the DM are<br>&nbsp;  secured, only packets associated to that protocol SHOULD be allowed.<br>```<br><br>This is too vague. What specifically about the means of securing the communications would lead the implementor to follow, or disregard, the SHOULD?<br><br>### Section 10<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Then,<br>&nbsp;  the HNA advertises the DM via a NOTIFY, that the Public Homenet Zone<br>&nbsp;  has been updated<br>```<br><br>Probably you mean "advertises to" or maybe better, "advises", where you've written "advertises"? If not, then I don't understand what's happening in this part.<br><br>### Section 12.2<br><br>Consider using "their" instead of "his".<br><br>### Section 14<br><br>Was "its" chosen as the pronoun for two persons being thanked, based on those persons' preferences? If not then consider whether you've used the right pronoun in those two places, in my experience it's fairly rare -- but not unheard-of! -- for a person to prefer to be referred to as "it" rather than the more common "he", "she", or "they".<br><br>### Appendix A.1<br><br>I'm a little confused -- the first couple of paragraphs led me to believe that this section was just going to tell me what parameters are required, but wasn't going to mandate the means of providing them. But then we come to,<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The above parameters MUST be be provisioned for ISP-specific reverse<br>&nbsp;  zones, as per [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options/">I-D.ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options</a>].<br>```<br><br>The "MUST" combined with the "as per" implies you're mandating that DHCPv6 be used to provision the parameters. If you really do intend to make dhc-options mandatory, it needs to be a normative reference. On the other hand if, as I think is likely, you only intended to use dhc-options as an example, perhaps something like this rewrite?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  The above parameters MUST be be provisioned for ISP-specific reverse<br>&nbsp;  zones. One example of how to do this can be found in <br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options/">I-D.ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options</a>].<br>```<br><br>### Appendix B - "registered_domain" or "zone"?<br><br>This threw me off -- in the CDDL you show "registered_domain" but in the explanatory text you describe (what I think is) this field as "Registered Homenet Domain (zone)". Should the latter be "Registered Homenet Domain (registered_domain)" instead? (Or, rename "registered_domain" in the CDDL as "zone"?)<br><br>### Appendix B - 2119 keywords<br><br>It's weird that you lead with "This section is non-normative" but then pepper the content with the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword "OPTIONAL". I think probably you don't mean it's "non-normative" (that generally means something like "this is an example, it doesn't define anything, it can safely be ignored"). Rather, I think you mean implementing it is optional. I think you could fix this by deleting the words "is non-normative and".<br><br>Also, "MANDATORY" isn't an <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword but you've capitalized it like one. If you want to introduce your own keyword to put the the force of VERY SERIOUS NORMATIVE CAPITALIZATION behind this word, I think it would be a good idea to define it in your Terminology section, probably right after the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> boilerplate paragraph. Alternately, you could just change all your uses of "mandatory" and "optional" in this section to lower-case. It would still be clear, IMO.<br><br>## NITS<br><br>- "these names needs" --&gt; "these names need"<br>- "The remaining of the document" --&gt; "the rest of the document"<br>- "buys a domain name to a registrar" --&gt; "buys a domain name from a registrar"<br>- "DOI has a roof of ownership" --&gt; "roof" should be...

If so, that's really not clear.<br><br><br>Section 1.2:<br>6: <br>O: "An alternative existing solution is to have a single zone, where a<br> host uses a RESTful HTTP service to register a single name into a<br> common public zone. "<br>P: "An alternative existing solution for residential customers is to..."<br>C: There are a number of alternative solutions, for example many companies use DHCP to populate a zone (usually using <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC 2136</a>), Windows Active Directory does something similar, many cloud / hosting providers will add and remove entries, etc. <br><br><br>7:<br>O: "This is often called "Dynamic DNS" [DDNS], and<br> there are a number of commercial providers. While the IETF has<br> defined Dynamic Update [<a href="/doc/rfc3007/">RFC3007</a>], in many - as far as the co-authors<br> know in all cases - case commercial "Dynamic Update" solutions are<br> implemented via a HTTPS RESTful API."<br> C1: I think that you need to be much clearer that the "Dynamic DNS" you are talking about in the first sentence is different to Dynamic Updates.<br> C2: I think that that is the wrong reference - <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a> is the Dynamic Updates RFC, <a href="/doc/rfc3007/">RFC3007</a> wraps it in TSIG.<br> C3: You have a repeated "case" (actually, "case" should move before the hyphen, and the second "cases" should be removed).<br> C4: 30 seconds with a search engine shows that Dyn DNS (of of the largest providers) supports <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a> dynamic DNS updates - <a href="https://help.dyn.com/tsig/">https://help.dyn.com/tsig/</a>, as does Dynu - <a href="https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/NSUpdate">https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/NSUpdate</a> . I'm assuming that many others to too...<br><br>8: <br> O: "For a very few numbers of hosts, the use of such a system provides an<br> alternative to the architecture described in this document."<br> C: Why? There are a huge number of users/hosts using Dynamic DNS services, and many of the Dynamic DNS providers are doing quite well, so I don't understand how their users count as "a very few".<br><br> 9: <br> O: "Dynamic<br> DNS - even adapted to IPv6 and ignoring those associated to an IPv4<br> development - does suffer from some severe limitations:"<br> C1: Why do you say "even adapted to IPv6"? IPv6 Dynamic DNS already exists and is deployed -- e.g: <a href="https://www.noip.com/blog/2019/11/03/ip-now-offers-ipv6-dynamic-dns/">https://www.noip.com/blog/2019/11/03/ip-now-offers-ipv6-dynamic-dns/</a><br> C2: " and ignoring those associated to an IPv4<br> development" - I'm unable to parse this.<br><br> 10: <br>O: "* the CPE/HNA router is unaware of the process, and cannot respond<br> to queries for these names and communications to these names<br> require an Internet connectivity is order to perform the DNS<br> resolution."<br>C: In many many cases the CPE itself is the Dynamic DNS clinet, e.g: <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/">https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/</a> lists 9 vendors of CPE whose devices do DDNS, and I'm aware of many many more.<br><br>11:<br>O: "* the CPE/HNA router cannot control the process. Any host can do<br> this regardless of whether or not the home network administrator<br> wants the name published or not."<br>C: This proposal doesn't "fix" that -- any host will stil be able to run a DDNS client and publish a name. I don't really view this as a bug, but if you are pointing out "issues"/"limitations" with something that you are aiming to replace, you should clarify that your proposal doesn't address some of them.<br><br>12:<br>O: "* "all the good names are taken" - current services provide a small<br> set of zones shared by all hosts across all home networks. More<br> especially, there is no notion of a domain specific home network."<br> C: That's completely wrong - a number of Dynamic DNS providers do this. 10 seconds with a search engine show:<br> <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/can-i-use-my-own-domain-name-with-no-ip/">https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/can-i-use-my-own-domain-name-with-no-ip/</a> <br> <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain/">https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain/</a><br> <a href="https://blog.jswart.xyz/posts/cloudflare-dynamic-dns/">https://blog.jswart.xyz/posts/cloudflare-dynamic-dns/</a><br> <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en">https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en</a><br><br> 13:<br> O: "* Dynamic Updates solution are not interoperable and each provider<br> has its own way to implement it."<br> C: This is also wrong. A number of providers support the 'dyndns2' protocol, including Dyn DNS, Amazon Route 53, Google Domains, No-IP, etc.<br><br> Section 1.3.1:<br> 14: <br> O: "A specific vendor with specific relations with a registrar or a<br> registry may sell a CPE that is provisioned with provisioned domain<br> name."<br>C: "is provisioned with provisioned"<br><br>15:<br>O: "Such domain name does not need to be necessary human readable."<br>C1: "Such *a* domain name"<br>C2: Remove "necessary"<br>C3: Is it really useful to have a name like "<a href="http://aheriuthga23.somevendor.exmaple.com">aheriuthga23.somevendor.exmaple.com</a>"? <br><br>16:<br>O: "One possible way is that the vendor also provisions..."<br>C: One possible way to what? The previous sentence talks about a vendor selling CPE, so one possible way for them to sell something? You probably need some text around "one way for a vendor to bootstrap" or "provision this", or something. Needs work.<br><br>17:<br>O: "One possible way is that the vendor also provisions the HNA with a<br> private and public keys as well as a certificate."<br>C1: Either "with a private and public keys" or "with a<br> private and public key"<br>C2: You say with keys and a certificate, and then talk about what the purpose of the keys are, but not what the cert is used for. <br><br>18:<br>O: "Instead these<br> keys are solely used by the HNA to proceed to the authentication."<br>C: "solely used" - does this mean that they cannot / must not be used for anything else?<br>C: "proceed to the authentication" does not parse. Perhaps "used for authentication" or "to the authentication phase" (not that that is really described either)<br><br>19:<br>O: "The reason to combine the domain name and the<br> key is that DOI are likely handle names better than keys and that<br> domain names might be used as a login which enables the key to be<br> regenerated."<br>C: "are likely handle" doesn't parse.<br>C: "domain names might be used as a login" - the domain name and what? Presumably I cannot just login with the credential "foo.cpe.example" without some other piece of information or anyone could regenerate the keys. And in that case, why are keys pre-provisioned on the device?<br><br>20:<br>O: "When the home network owner plugs the CPE at home, ...""<br>C: "plugs in the CPE"<br><br><br>Section 1.3.2. Agnostic CPE:<br>21: <br>O: "An CPE that is not preconfigured may also take advantage to the<br> protocol defined in this document but some configuration steps will<br> be needed."<br>C: s/An CPE/A CPE/<br>C: s/may also take advantage to the protocol/may also take advantage of the<br> protocol/ (actually I think "may also use the protocol", but whatever...)<br><br>22: <br>O: " 1.

Perhaps "One potential mechanism would be to provide the user with a JSON object which they can copy and paste into the CPE" (or similar).<br><br>24:<br>O: "What matters at that point is the DOI<br> being able to generate authentication credentials for the HNA to<br> authenticate itself to the DOI. <br>C: s/being able/is able/ <br>C: It also isn't that it needs to be able to do this, but rather that it can provide authentication credentials to the HNA.<br><br>25:<br>O: "If the DOI is not the registrar, then the proof of ownership needs<br> to be established using protocols like ACME [<a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC8555</a>] for example<br> that will end in the generation of a certificate."<br>C: Why does it need to "end in the generation of a certificate"? All you need is proof of ownership, yes? And ACME is generally used to prove ownership of a hostname / SAN - it is very unclear here what exactly you are proving ownership of / to -- the hostname to the IP/device? Presumably not because the purpose of this is to create that delegation... <br><br>26:<br>O: "ACME is used<br> here to the purpose of automating the generation of the<br> certificate, the CA may be a specific CA or the DOI. "<br>C: Why "a specific CA or the DOI"? If I get a (valid) cert from any old CA, is that not valid? And it I get a cert from the DOI, it is acting as a CA, isn't it? What is this actually trying to say?<br><br>27:<br>O: "With that<br> being done, the DOI has a roof of ownership and can proceed as<br> above."<br>C: "proof of ownership"<br><br><br><br>Section 3. Architecture Description<br>28:<br>O: "Note that<br> Appendix B defines necessary parameter to configure the HNA."<br>C: Does this mean that Appendix B is normative?<br>C: s/parameter/parameters/<br><br><br>29:<br>O: "The DOI will<br> serve every DNSSEC request of the Public Homenet Zone coming from<br> outside the home network."<br>C: The DOI gets DNS requests, not DNSSEC requests (there isn't really such a thing as a DNSSEC request)<br>C: "every"?<br>C: What about if a device inside the home queries the DOI? It should still respond, yes?<br><br>30:<br>O: "the resolution is expected to be handled by the Homenet<br> Resolver as detaille din further details below."<br>C: "detailed in"<br><br>31:<br>O: "Registered Homenet Domain Name"<br>C: You don't have "Registered Homenet Domain Name" in the terminology section, either add it or (better yet) s/Name/name/<br><br>32: <br>O: "The HNA SHOULD build the Public Homenet Zone in a single view<br> populated ..."<br>C: It is unclear what "in a single view" means here - views are a way of mapping clients to different sets of answers, and they are not in a zone.<br><br>33: <br>O: "Once the Public Homenet Zone has been built, the HNA communicates and<br> synchronizes it with the DOI using a primary/secondary setting as<br> described in Figure 1. "<br>C: It is unclear what "using a primary/secondary setting" means, and it isn't "described in Figure 1."<br><br>34: <br>O: "The HNA acts as a hidden primary [<a href="/doc/rfc8499/">RFC8499</a>]"<br>C: 8499 doesn't define hidden primary; it does define Hidden master and Primary server. It also says that a master and a primary are the same, but the reference should be clearer.<br><br>35: <br>O: "the DM behaves as a secondary responsible to distribute the<br> Public Homenet Zone to the multiple Public Authoritative Servers that<br> DOI is responsible for."<br> C: s/responsible to distribute/responsible for distributing/<br> C: "the multiple Public Authoritative Servers" - which servers? A DOI may have many many sets of authoritative servers, only some of which may be authoritative for this zone. <br><br> 36:<br> O: "one or more Distribution Channels (Section 6 that distribute the<br> Public Homenet Zone from the DM to the Public Authoritative Server<br> serving the Public Homenet Zone on the Internet."<br>C: (Section 6/ (Section 6)/<br>C: s/Public Authoritative Server/Public Authoritative Servers/<br><br>37: <br>O: "Resolution is performed by the DNSSEC resolvers."<br>C: Which "the DNSSEC resolvers"? ("the" implies a specific set) Also, why are these "DNSSEC resolvers"? Does this mean that non-DNSSEC validating DNS servers cannot resolve these names (presumably not, but...)<br><br>38:<br>O: "When the resolution<br> is performed outside the home network, the DNSSEC Resolver resolves<br> the DS record on the Global DNS and the name associated to the Public<br> Homenet Zone (myhome.example) on the Public Authoritative Servers."<br>C: What is this actually trying to say? The DS record is resolved on the "Global DNS" but the name is resolved on the "Public Authoritative Servers" - is this supposed to mean that the Public Authoritative Servers are not part of the Global DNS? And the DS record is part of the "name associated to the Public Homenet Zone", but published at the parent. Is this supposed to just be "is resolved like any other name"?<br><br>39: <br>O: "On the other hand, to<br> provide resilience to the Public Homenet Zone in case of WAN<br> connectivity disruption, the Homenet DNSSEC Resolver SHOULD be able<br> to perform the resolution on the Homenet Authoritative Servers."<br>C: "the Homenet DNSSEC Resolver" - this implies that this is only one. It also seems odd to say that it "SHOLD be able to", and then immediately say that this can't actually be done because this isn't any (current) way to configure the DNSSEC information (or, if it is defined in 7788 I missed it)<br><br>40: <br>O: "How the Homenet Authoritative Servers are provisioned is also out of<br> scope of this specification. It could be implemented using primary<br> and secondary servers, or via rsync."<br>C: It is unclear what this is trying to say - "are provisioned" with what? It this trying to say "how the zone information is syncronized between the servers"? Or how the domains are provisioned onto the servers? <br><br><br>41:<br>O: "The main issue is that the Dynamic DNS update would also update the<br> parent zone's (NS, DS and associated A or AAAA records) while the<br> goal is to update the DM configuration files. The visible NS records SHOULD remain pointing at the cloud provider's server IP address -<br> which in many cases will be an anycast addresses. Revealing the<br> address of the HNA in the DNS is not desirable. "<br>C: Huh? *What* main issue? Is this text just misplaced and supposed to be somewhere else? It seems completely unrelated to this section. Also, what "cloud provider"? This is the only mention of a cloud provider. And what Dynamic DNS update are you talking about here? <br><br>42: <br>O: "While<br> information is carried from the DOI to the HNA and from the HNA to<br> the DOI, the HNA is always initiating the exchange in both<br> directions.<br> As such the HNA has a prior knowledge of the DM identity (X509<br> certificate), the IP address and port number to use and protocol to<br> set secure session."<br>C: "As such" doesn't make sense here (or I'm unable to parse it) -- the first bit says that the HNA initiates the exchanges, but the second bit says that "As such it has knowledge" - perhaps you mean "requires"? I have no idea what this is supposed to say.<br><br>Section 4.1. Information to Build the Public Homenet Zone:<br>43:<br>O: "The HNA builds the Public Homenet Zone based on information retrieved<br> from the DM."<br>C: Retrieved how? (Link to 4.5.1, otherwise the reader will be very confused.)<br><br><br>44: <br>O: "The information includes at least names and IP addresses of the<br> Public Authoritative Name Servers. In term of RRset information this<br> includes:<br> * the MNAME of the SOA,"<br> C: This says "this includes at least names and IP addresses" but then also suddenly throws in the MNAME. Also, what is the MNAME actually used for? The document says that you have to put it in the zone, but why must it be what the DM says, but the other parameter in the SOA can be changed?<br><br>45:<br>O: "The DM MAY also provide operational parameters such as other fields<br> of SOA (SERIAL, RNAME, REFRESH, RETRY, EXPIRE and MINIMUM)."<br>C: S 4.5.1 says that this is received over AXFR, so the HNA always gets the SOA -- so how is this a "MAY also provide"? Or is it supposed to be that it always provides these, but the HNA can ignore some or all of them? <br><br>Section "4.2. Information to build the DNSSEC chain of trust"<br>46:<br>O: "The HNA SHOULD provide the hash of the KSK (DS RRset), so the DOI<br> provides this value to the parent zone."<br>C: Is it that the HNA should provide the DS, or a hash of the KSK? (The DS is more than just the hash).<br>C: "so that the DOI can provide"<br><br>47:<br>O: "When such relation exists, the<br> HNA should be able to request the DOI to update the DS RRset in the<br> parent zone."<br>C: "should be able to request" - this implies that there is a specific way for the HNA to request this, if this relationship exists -- how would the HNA know this? Shouldn't it always send the DS? <br><br>48:<br>O: "The HNA SHOULD provide... " and "Though the HNA may also later directly update the values of the DS<br> via the Control Channel, it is RECOMMENDED to use other mechanisms".<br> "SHOULD provide" how? Over the Control Channel? And how does that relate to the RECOMMEND to use other mechanisms?<br><br>Section 4.3. Information to set the Synchronization Channel<br>49:<br>O: "As a result, the HNA must provide the IP<br> address the DM is using to reach the HNA. The synchronization<br> Channel will be set between that IP address and the IP address of the<br> DM. By default, the IP address used by the HNA in the Control<br> Channel is considered by the DM and the specification of the IP by<br> the HNA is only OPTIONAL. The transport channel (including port<br> number) is the same as the one used between the HNA and the DM for<br> the Control Channel."<br>C: This entire paragraph is really confusing. I'm guessing that this is trying to sat that the HNA provides the IP for the DM to contact it?<br>C: It also says that the DM "considers" the IP used by the HNA, and so the specification of the IP is OPTIONAL. I'm guessing that this is trying to say that the DM will, by default, use the IP that the HNA used to contact it? In the non-default case, how exactly does the HNA specify the address? (how is this communicated?).<br>C: Also, "The transport channel (including port<br> number) is the same as the one used between the HNA and the DM for<br> the Control Channel." -- so the transport channel and Control Channel use the same IPs and ports? How are messages disambiguated? Isn't this jsut one channel then?</div></td>

I agree that it is much less common / useful. <br><br><br>5:<br>O: "However, since communications<br> are established with names which remains a global identifier, the<br> communication can be protected by TLS the same way it is protected on<br> the global Internet."<br>C: "However" implies that the sentence follows on from a previous point and provides a refutation / comparison, and this sentence doesn't - it is more of a fragment / new thought. <br>C: s/remains/remain/ (grammar)<br>C: More text is needed here - I'm *assuming* that you are meaning that because the name is globally resolvable to an address, that this can be used to obtain a certificate for that name? If so, that's really not clear.<br><br><br>Section 1.2:<br>6: <br>O: "An alternative existing solution is to have a single zone, where a<br> host uses a RESTful HTTP service to register a single name into a<br> common public zone. "<br>P: "An alternative existing solution for residential customers is to..."<br>C: There are a number of alternative solutions, for example many companies use DHCP to populate a zone (usually using <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC 2136</a>), Windows Active Directory does something similar, many cloud / hosting providers will add and remove entries, etc. <br><br><br>7:<br>O: "This is often called "Dynamic DNS" [DDNS], and<br> there are a number of commercial providers. While the IETF has<br> defined Dynamic Update [<a href="/doc/rfc3007/">RFC3007</a>], in many - as far as the co-authors<br> know in all cases - case commercial "Dynamic Update" solutions are<br> implemented via a HTTPS RESTful API."<br> C1: I think that you need to be much clearer that the "Dynamic DNS" you are talking about in the first sentence is different to Dynamic Updates.<br> C2: I think that that is the wrong reference - <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a> is the Dynamic Updates RFC, <a href="/doc/rfc3007/">RFC3007</a> wraps it in TSIG.<br> C3: You have a repeated "case" (actually, "case" should move before the hyphen, and the second "cases" should be removed).<br> C4: 30 seconds with a search engine shows that Dyn DNS (of of the largest providers) supports <a href="/doc/rfc2136/">RFC2136</a> dynamic DNS updates - <a href="https://help.dyn.com/tsig/">https://help.dyn.com/tsig/</a>, as does Dynu - <a href="https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/NSUpdate">https://www.dynu.com/DynamicDNS/IPUpdateClient/NSUpdate</a> . I'm assuming that many others to too...<br><br>8: <br> O: "For a very few numbers of hosts, the use of such a system provides an<br> alternative to the architecture described in this document."<br> C: Why? There are a huge number of users/hosts using Dynamic DNS services, and many of the Dynamic DNS providers are doing quite well, so I don't understand how their users count as "a very few".<br><br> 9: <br> O: "Dynamic<br> DNS - even adapted to IPv6 and ignoring those associated to an IPv4<br> development - does suffer from some severe limitations:"<br> C1: Why do you say "even adapted to IPv6"? IPv6 Dynamic DNS already exists and is deployed -- e.g: <a href="https://www.noip.com/blog/2019/11/03/ip-now-offers-ipv6-dynamic-dns/">https://www.noip.com/blog/2019/11/03/ip-now-offers-ipv6-dynamic-dns/</a><br> C2: " and ignoring those associated to an IPv4<br> development" - I'm unable to parse this.<br><br> 10: <br>O: "* the CPE/HNA router is unaware of the process, and cannot respond<br> to queries for these names and communications to these names<br> require an Internet connectivity is order to perform the DNS<br> resolution."<br>C: In many many cases the CPE itself is the Dynamic DNS clinet, e.g: <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/">https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/how-to-configure-ddns-in-router/</a> lists 9 vendors of CPE whose devices do DDNS, and I'm aware of many many more.<br><br>11:<br>O: "* the CPE/HNA router cannot control the process. Any host can do<br> this regardless of whether or not the home network administrator<br> wants the name published or not."<br>C: This proposal doesn't "fix" that -- any host will stil be able to run a DDNS client and publish a name. I don't really view this as a bug, but if you are pointing out "issues"/"limitations" with something that you are aiming to replace, you should clarify that your proposal doesn't address some of them.<br><br>12:<br>O: "* "all the good names are taken" - current services provide a small<br> set of zones shared by all hosts across all home networks. More<br> especially, there is no notion of a domain specific home network."<br> C: That's completely wrong - a number of Dynamic DNS providers do this. 10 seconds with a search engine show:<br> <a href="https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/can-i-use-my-own-domain-name-with-no-ip/">https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/can-i-use-my-own-domain-name-with-no-ip/</a> <br> <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain/">https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/595/11/how-do-i-enable-dynamic-dns-for-a-domain/</a><br> <a href="https://blog.jswart.xyz/posts/cloudflare-dynamic-dns/">https://blog.jswart.xyz/posts/cloudflare-dynamic-dns/</a><br> <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en">https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en</a><br><br> 13:<br> O: "* Dynamic Updates solution are not interoperable and each provider<br> has its own way to implement it."<br> C: This is also wrong. A number of providers support the 'dyndns2' protocol, including Dyn DNS, Amazon Route 53, Google Domains, No-IP, etc.<br><br> Section 1.3.1:<br> 14: <br> O: "A specific vendor with specific relations with a registrar or a<br> registry may sell a CPE that is provisioned with provisioned domain<br> name."<br>C: "is provisioned with provisioned"<br><br>15:<br>O: "Such domain name does not need to be necessary human readable."<br>C1: "Such *a* domain name"<br>C2: Remove "necessary"<br>C3: Is it really useful to have a name like "<a href="http://aheriuthga23.somevendor.exmaple.com">aheriuthga23.somevendor.exmaple.com</a>"? <br><br>16:<br>O: "One possible way is that the vendor also provisions..."<br>C: One possible way to what? The previous sentence talks about a vendor selling CPE, so one possible way for them to sell something? You probably need some text around "one way for a vendor to bootstrap" or "provision this", or something. Needs work.<br><br>17:<br>O: "One possible way is that the vendor also provisions the HNA with a<br> private and public keys as well as a certificate."<br>C1: Either "with a private and public keys" or "with a<br> private and public key"<br>C2: You say with keys and a certificate, and then talk about what the purpose of the keys are, but not what the cert is used for. <br><br>18:<br>O: "Instead these<br> keys are solely used by the HNA to proceed to the authentication."<br>C: "solely used" - does this mean that they cannot / must not be used for anything else?<br>C: "proceed to the authentication" does not parse. Perhaps "used for authentication" or "to the authentication phase" (not that that is really described either)<br><br>19:<br>O: "The reason to combine the domain name and the<br> key is that DOI are likely handle names better than keys and that<br> domain names might be used as a login which enables the key to be<br> regenerated."<br>C: "are likely handle" doesn't parse.<br>C: "domain names might be used as a login" - the domain name and what? Presumably I cannot just login with the credential "foo.cpe.example" without some other piece of information or anyone could regenerate the keys. And in that case, why are keys pre-provisioned on the device?<br><br>20:<br>O: "When the home network owner plugs the CPE at home, ...""<br>C: "plugs in the CPE"<br><br><br>Section 1.3.2. Agnostic CPE:<br>21: <br>O: "An CPE that is not preconfigured may also take advantage to the<br> protocol defined in this document but some configuration steps will<br> be needed."<br>C: s/An CPE/A CPE/<br>C: s/may also take advantage to the protocol/may also take advantage of the<br> protocol/ (actually I think "may also use the protocol", but whatever...)<br><br>22: <br>O: " 1. The owner of the home network buys a domain name to a registrar,<br> and as such creates an account on that registrar"<br>C: s/to a registrar/from a registrar/<br><br>23:<br>O: "A good way to provide the<br> parameters would be the home network be able to copy/paste a JSON<br> object"<br>C: home networks cannot copy and paste. Perhaps "One potential mechanism would be to provide the user with a JSON object which they can copy and paste into the CPE" (or similar).<br><br>24:<br>O: "What matters at that point is the DOI<br> being able to generate authentication credentials for the HNA to<br> authenticate itself to the DOI. <br>C: s/being able/is able/ <br>C: It also isn't that it needs to be able to do this, but rather that it can provide authentication credentials to the HNA.<br><br>25:<br>O: "If the DOI is not the registrar, then the proof of ownership needs<br> to be established using protocols like ACME [<a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC8555</a>] for example<br> that will end in the generation of a certificate."<br>C: Why does it need to "end in the generation of a certificate"? All you need is proof of ownership, yes? And ACME is generally used to prove ownership of a hostname / SAN - it is very unclear here what exactly you are proving ownership of / to -- the hostname to the IP/device? Presumably not because the purpose of this is to create that delegation... <br><br>26:<br>O: "ACME is used<br> here to the purpose of automating the generation of the<br> certificate, the CA may be a specific CA or the DOI. "<br>C: Why "a specific CA or the DOI"? If I get a (valid) cert from any old CA, is that not valid? And it I get a cert from the DOI, it is acting as a CA, isn't it? What is this actually trying to say?<br><br>27:<br>O: "With that<br> being done, the DOI has a roof of ownership and can proceed as<br> above."<br>C: "proof of ownership"<br><br><br><br>Section 3. Architecture Description<br>28:<br>O: "Note that<br> Appendix B defines necessary parameter to configure the HNA."<br>C: Does this mean that Appendix B is normative?<br>C: s/parameter/parameters/<br><br><br>29:<br>O: "The DOI will<br> serve every DNSSEC request of the Public Homenet Zone coming from<br> outside the home network."<br>C: The DOI gets DNS requests, not DNSSEC requests (there isn't really such a thing as a DNSSEC request)<br>C: "every"?<br>C: What about if a device inside the home queries the DOI? It should still respond, yes?<br><br>30:<br>O: "the resolution is expected to be handled by the Homenet<br> Resolver as detaille din further details below."<br>C: "detailed in"<br><br>31:<br>O: "Registered Homenet Domain Name"<br>C: You don't have "Registered Homenet Domain Name" in the terminology section, either add it or (better yet) s/Name/name/<br><br>32: <br>O: "The HNA SHOULD build the Public Homenet Zone in a single view<br> populated ..."<br>C: It is unclear what "in a single view" means here - views are a way of mapping clients to different sets of answers, and they are not in a zone.<br><br>33: <br>O: "Once the Public Homenet Zone has been built, the HNA communicates and<br> synchronizes it with the DOI using a primary/secondary setting as<br> described in Figure 1. "<br>C: It is unclear what "using a primary/secondary setting" means, and it isn't "described in Figure 1."<br><br>34: <br>O: "The HNA acts as a hidden primary [<a href="/doc/rfc8499/">RFC8499</a>]"<br>C: 8499 doesn't define hidden primary; it does define Hidden master and Primary server. It also says that a master and a primary are the same, but the reference should be clearer.<br><br>35: <br>O: "the DM behaves as a secondary responsible to distribute the<br> Public Homenet Zone to the multiple Public Authoritative Servers that<br> DOI is responsible for."<br> C: s/responsible to distribute/responsible for distributing/<br> C: "the multiple Public Authoritative Servers" - which servers? A DOI may have many many sets of authoritative servers, only some of which may be authoritative for this zone. <br><br> 36:<br> O: "one or more Distribution Channels (Section 6 that distribute the<br> Public Homenet Zone from the DM to the Public Authoritative Server<br> serving the Public Homenet Zone on the Internet."<br>C: (Section 6/ (Section 6)/<br>C: s/Public Authoritative Server/Public Authoritative Servers/<br><br>37: <br>O: "Resolution is performed by the DNSSEC resolvers."<br>C: Which "the DNSSEC resolvers"? ("the" implies a specific set) Also, why are these "DNSSEC resolvers"? Does this mean that non-DNSSEC validating DNS servers cannot resolve these names (presumably not, but...)<br><br>38:<br>O: "When the resolution<br> is performed outside the home network, the DNSSEC Resolver resolves<br> the DS record on the Global DNS and the name associated to the Public<br> Homenet Zone (myhome.example) on the Public Authoritative Servers."<br>C: What is this actually trying to say? The DS record is resolved on the "Global DNS" but the name is resolved on the "Public Authoritative Servers" - is this supposed to mean that the Public Authoritative Servers are not part of the Global DNS? And the DS record is part of the "name associated to the Public Homenet Zone", but published at the parent. Is this supposed to just be "is resolved like any other name"?<br><br>39: <br>O: "On the other hand, to<br> provide resilience to the Public Homenet Zone in case of WAN<br> connectivity disruption, the Homenet DNSSEC Resolver SHOULD be able<br> to perform the resolution on the Homenet Authoritative Servers."<br>C: "the Homenet DNSSEC Resolver" - this implies that this is only one. It also seems odd to say that it "SHOLD be able to", and then immediately say that this can't actually be done because this isn't any (current) way to configure the DNSSEC information (or, if it is defined in 7788 I missed it)<br><br>40: <br>O: "How the Homenet Authoritative Servers are provisioned is also out of<br> scope of this specification. It could be implemented using primary<br> and secondary servers, or via rsync."<br>C: It is unclear what this is trying to say - "are provisioned" with what? It this trying to say "how the zone information is syncronized between the servers"? Or how the domains are provisioned onto the servers? <br><br><br>41:<br>O: "The main issue is that the Dynamic DNS update would also update the<br> parent zone's (NS, DS and associated A or AAAA records) while the<br> goal is to update the DM configuration files. The visible NS records SHOULD remain pointing at the cloud provider's server IP address -<br> which in many cases will be an anycast addresses. Revealing the<br> address of the HNA in the DNS is not desirable. "<br>C: Huh? *What* main issue? Is this text just misplaced and supposed to be somewhere else? It seems completely unrelated to this section. Also, what "cloud provider"? This is the only mention of a cloud provider. And what Dynamic DNS update are you talking about here? <br><br>42: <br>O: "While<br> information is carried from the DOI to the HNA and from the HNA to<br> the DOI, the HNA is always initiating the exchange in both<br> directions.<br> As such the HNA has a prior knowledge of the DM identity (X509<br> certificate), the IP address and port number to use and protocol to<br> set secure session."<br>C: "As such" doesn't make sense here (or I'm unable to parse it) -- the first bit says that the HNA initiates the exchanges, but the second bit says that "As such it has knowledge" - perhaps you mean "requires"? I have no idea what this is supposed to say.<br><br>Section 4.1. Information to Build the Public Homenet Zone:<br>43:<br>O: "The HNA builds the Public Homenet Zone based on information retrieved<br> from the DM."<br>C: Retrieved how? (Link to 4.5.1, otherwise the reader will be very confused.)<br><br><br>44: <br>O: "The information includes at least names and IP addresses of the<br> Public Authoritative Name Servers. In term of RRset information this<br> includes:<br> * the MNAME of the SOA,"<br> C: This says "this includes at least names and IP addresses" but then also suddenly throws in the MNAME. Also, what is the MNAME actually used for? The document says that you have to put it in the zone, but why must it be what the DM says, but the other parameter in the SOA can be changed?<br><br>45:<br>O: "The DM MAY also provide operational parameters such as other fields<br> of SOA (SERIAL, RNAME, REFRESH, RETRY, EXPIRE and MINIMUM)."<br>C: S 4.5.1 says that this is received over AXFR, so the HNA always gets the SOA -- so how is this a "MAY also provide"? Or is it supposed to be that it always provides these, but the HNA can ignore some or all of them? <br><br>Section "4.2. Information to build the DNSSEC chain of trust"<br>46:<br>O: "The HNA SHOULD provide the hash of the KSK (DS RRset), so the DOI<br> provides this value to the parent zone."<br>C: Is it that the HNA should provide the DS, or a hash of the KSK? (The DS is more than just the hash).<br>C: "so that the DOI can provide"<br><br>47:<br>O: "When such relation exists, the<br> HNA should be able to request the DOI to update the DS RRset in the<br> parent zone."<br>C: "should be able to request" - this implies that there is a specific way for the HNA to request this, if this relationship exists -- how would the HNA know this? Shouldn't it always send the DS? <br><br>48:<br>O: "The HNA SHOULD provide... " and "Though the HNA may also later directly update the values of the DS<br> via the Control Channel, it is RECOMMENDED to use other mechanisms".<br> "SHOULD provide" how? Over the Control Channel? And how does that relate to the RECOMMEND to use other mechanisms?<br><br>Section 4.3. Information to set the Synchronization Channel<br>49:<br>O: "As a result, the HNA must provide the IP<br> address the DM is using to reach the HNA. The synchronization<br> Channel will be set between that IP address and the IP address of the<br> DM. By default, the IP address used by the HNA in the Control<br> Channel is considered by the DM and the specification of the IP by<br> the HNA is only OPTIONAL. The transport channel (including port<br> number) is the same as the one used between the HNA and the DM for<br> the Control Channel."<br>C: This entire paragraph is really confusing. I'm guessing that this is trying to sat that the HNA provides the IP for the DM to contact it?<br>C: It also says that the DM "considers" the IP used by the HNA, and so the specification of the IP is OPTIONAL. I'm guessing that this is trying to say that the DM will, by default, use the IP that the HNA used to contact it? In the non-default case, how exactly does the HNA specify the address? (how is this communicated?).<br>C: Also, "The transport channel (including port<br> number) is the same as the one used between the HNA and the DM for<br> the Control Channel." -- so the transport channel and Control Channel use the same IPs and ports? How are messages disambiguated? Isn't this jsut one channel then?</div></td>
