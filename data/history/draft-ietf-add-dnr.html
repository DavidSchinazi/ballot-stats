Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members and from key non-WG members? <br><br>It has been reviewed by working group members, hence the number of iterations of the draft to date.&nbsp; A total of 128 mailing list posts reference the various DDR drafts, complemented by closed issues and closed pull requests on GitHub.&nbsp; The authors have also given updates on progress during working group sessions at IETF meetings to highlight the draft to a broader audience.<br><br>Looking outside of the ADD working group, there has been consultation with the DHC working Group on the DHCP content in this draft.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br>Does the Document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.&nbsp; A number of detailed reviews of the document were posted to the working group mailing list, along with the issues and pull requests logged on GitHub.&nbsp; In addition, the authors have responded positively to points raised during discussions at IETF meetings, for example by leveraging SVCB.&nbsp; Where proposed changes have been rejected, comments have been posted to the mailing list to explain the reasoning. <br><br>When the document has been updated, the authors have been careful to post an explanation of the changes to the mailing list to indicate what input has been taken on board in the new version.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br>(1.c)&nbsp; Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document needs more review from a particular or broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with AAA, internationalization, or XML?<br><br>No – the authors have done a good job in highlighting specific sections where they have sought additional review or input.<br><br><br><br>(1.d)&nbsp; Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of?&nbsp; For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.&nbsp; In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.&nbsp; <br><br>No.<br><br><br><br>Has an IPR disclosure related to this document been filed?&nbsp; If so, please include a reference to the disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on this issue.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been filed relating to this document.<br><br>There was a very vague IPR disclosure by Verisign early after the ADD working group was formed that may pertain in some way to ADD.  It involved unpublished filings and did not include any detail other than Verisign had filed a patent with the USPTO.&nbsp; For reference, the following link is to the relevant posts on the ADD mailing list.<br><br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/add/lB8c9COt5jyqgHhWjW9TFH_V4Nk/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/add/lB8c9COt5jyqgHhWjW9TFH_V4Nk/</a><br><br><br><br>(1.e)&nbsp; How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?&nbsp; Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There has been discussion amongst a variety of individuals, with ten people mentioned in the acknowledgements section of the document.&nbsp; I believe that the document represents the consensus view of the working group as a whole and that it addresses a significant need that was identified during previous working group discussions.<br><br><br><br>(1.f)&nbsp; Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?&nbsp; If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.&nbsp; (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is entered into the ID Tracker.)<br><br>There are no open issues that I am aware of, nor any other outstanding areas of concern, nor are there any known issues of extreme discontent or conflict.&nbsp;

How do home users run their own without having a<br>public domain? And how do I authenticate the encrypted DNS on 10.1.1.1<br>that has no FQDN? (and really, has no verifiable identity at all)<br>Note: There are ways to generate and transport certificates from public<br>reachable nodes to the Encrypted DNS servers, but this is still a complicated<br>method, which home routers are unlikely to be able to safely do.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The DNS client verifies the connection based on PKIX validation<br><br>No CRLs, OneCRL updates, no OCSP, no Certificate Transparency is available<br>without functional DNS. So full PKIX validation as specified here is not<br>available.<br>Note: The text was updated and mentions OCSP, but it is not clear that a<br>hard fail should happen based on missing OCSP stapling or missing CT information.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If the DHCP responses or RAs are dropped by the attacker, the client<br>&nbsp;  can fallback to use a preconfigured encrypted DNS resolver.<br><br>This raises the big question of why you think that strategy is a "fallback<br>strategy" and not the default behaviour of the client. Wouldn't it be more<br>secure if there is no DHCP/RA drop attacks possible?<br>Note: this is an item where even though client policy is out of scope of<br>the charter, the document defines a tiny bit (and not enough) client policy.<br><br>## Comments<br><br>###<br><br>The overarching issue of the ADD WG in general is the concern that using<br>the local network's DNS server (encrypted or not) is a privacy concern.<br>With HTTP dying and HTTPS sealing the last plain-text with Encrypted Client<br>Hello (ECH), DNS is the last resort of getting to know the enduser's<br>intent of where they are trying to connect to.<br><br>There are many parties interested in seeing the DNS query content, but<br>the enduser is rarely able to determine whether the local network used<br>can be trusted. This is true for coffee shops, hotels, malls but also<br>their home ISP. The only clear case of trust is the enterprise user, who<br>is provisioned (forced) via their enterprise management to use specific<br>DNS resolvers.<br><br>There are a number of well-known public DNS services such as Google DNS<br>(8.8.8.8), Quad9 (9.9.9.9) and Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). Arguably, these<br>servers have a better reputation of protecting the enduser's privacy<br>than most local networks, as endusers cannot trust most local networks<br>they use as they are not even aware of who owns various wifi networks they use.<br><br>The question all of this raises is, whether the user isn't better of<br>just never trusting or using the local network's DNS server, whether<br>encrypted or not. In that case, all of these ADD documents have little<br>value. For example, we see this already with Firefox and its TRR program<br><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver</a> and to some extend<br>with the Android phone "private DNS" feature<br><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/795644/how-to-enable-secure-private-dns-on-android/">https://www.howtogeek.com/795644/how-to-enable-secure-private-dns-on-android/</a><br><br>On the other hand, we have the argument of, if the enduser is using<br>the local unencrypted DNS, it might as well use the local encrypted DNS.<br>While this is true if this decision is hidden from the enduser, if the<br>enduser believes they are using "encrypted DNS", they might not be aware<br>that this encrypted connection still reveals all privacy sensitive data<br>to the local network entity (or its trusted third party). An aware enduser<br>might also make different choices when they think their DNS is "safely<br>encrypted", such as visiting the website of an abortion provider. That is,<br>the ADD specifications might lure the enduser in a false sense of security.<br>To me this is one of the biggest issues while reviewing the ADD drafts. Are<br>these drafts potentially harmful to the enduser, or does it only offer<br>improvements to the status quo of the current common (non-encrypted) DNS<br>topologies? While the latter could be true, I do believe based on the<br>development seen at Google/Android and Mozilla/Firefox, that we are<br>already far into the phase where the enduser only decides _which_ remote<br>trustworthy encrypted DNS service they are going to use and as such only<br>use the local network DNS to kickstart their internet connection (captive<br>portal, paywall) after which they switch to remote encrypted DNS service.<br><br>And that of course, raises an issue with DNS security providers, who<br>wish to monitor and firewall all their DNS clients' DNS requests to<br>improve enduser security. This includes government mandates to ISPs to<br>filter certain DNS requests for local legal reasons. Which again raises<br>the issues of where such filtering power can be abused by authoritative<br>regimes, restrictive cults (eg scientology netnanny) or other malicious entities.<br><br>To summarize, I am really on the fence with respect to all the ADD drafts.<br>While "encrypted DNS" is always better than "unencrypted DNS", the<br>overarching issue of "never use or trust the local DNS resolvers" trumps<br>the DNR /DDR protocols. For those who can dictate how their users MUST<br>use DNS (eg Enterprise usage, parental control, opt-in security software),<br>device provisioning/configuration options are available that require no<br>ADD protocols with the exception of draft-ietf-add-svcb-dns.</div></td>

If to an external IP, isn't it just acting as a NAT/router<br>forwarding packets and then what does it mean to be an "encrypted DNS forwarder" ?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  This recommendation is meant to isolate local network<br>&nbsp;  DNS resolver services from the public Internet and prevent external<br>&nbsp;  attacks against the local Encrypted DNS resolver.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the DHCP responses or RAs are dropped by the attacker, the client<br>&nbsp;  can fallback to use a preconfigured encrypted DNS resolver.<br><br>This raises the big question of why you think that strategy is a "fallback<br>strategy" and not the default behaviour of the client. Wouldn't it be more<br>secure if there is no DHCP/RA drop attacks possible?<br><br>###<br><br>Multihoming is declared out of scope, but realistically most devices we are<br>talking about here are phones, and those are all multihomed. So I feel pretty<br>strongly that it should not be left out of scope.</div></td>

Who is the Document Shepherd for this document?*&nbsp; <br><br>Document Shepherd: Andrew Campling<br><br><br>*Has the Document Shepherd personally reviewed this version of the document and, in particular, does he or she believe this version is ready for forwarding to the IESG for publication?*<br><br>I have reviewed the document and believe that it is ready for consideration by the IESG<br><br><br>*(1.b)&nbsp; Has the document had adequate review both from key WG members and from key non-WG members?&nbsp; <br><br>It has been reviewed by working group members, hence the number of iterations of the draft to date.&nbsp; A total of 128 mailing list posts reference the various DDR drafts, complemented by closed issues and closed pull requests on GitHub.&nbsp; The authors have also given updates on progress during working group sessions at IETF meetings to highlight the draft to a broader audience.<br><br>Looking outside of the ADD working group, there has been consultation with the DHC working Group on the DHCP content in this draft.&nbsp; <br><br><br>*Does the Document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.&nbsp; A number of detailed reviews of the document were posted to the working group mailing list, along with the issues and pull requests logged on GitHub.&nbsp; In addition, the authors have responded positively to points raised during discussions at IETF meetings, for example by leveraging SVCB.&nbsp; Where proposed changes have been rejected, comments have been posted to the mailing list to explain the reasoning. <br><br>When the document has been updated, the authors have been careful to post an explanation of the changes to the mailing list to indicate what input has been taken on board in the new version.&nbsp; <br><br><br>*(1.c)&nbsp; Does the Document Shepherd have concerns that the document needs more review from a particular or broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, someone familiar with AAA, internationalization, or XML?*<br><br>No – the authors have done a good job in highlighting specific sections where they have sought additional review or input.<br><br><br>*(1.d)&nbsp; Does the Document Shepherd have any specific concerns or issues with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of?&nbsp; For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.&nbsp; In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.*&nbsp; <br><br>No.<br><br><br>*Has an IPR disclosure related to this document been filed?&nbsp; If so, please include a reference to the disclosure and summarize the WG discussion and conclusion on this issue.*<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been filed relating to this document.<br><br>There was a very vague IPR disclosure by Verisign early after the ADD working group was formed that may pertain in some way to ADD.  It involved unpublished filings and did not include any detail other than Verisign had filed a patent with the USPTO.&nbsp; For reference, the following link is to the relevant posts on the ADD mailing list.<br><br><br><br><br>*(1.e)&nbsp; How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?&nbsp; Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?*<br><br>There has been discussion amongst a variety of individuals, with ten people mentioned in the acknowledgements section of the document.&nbsp; I believe that the document represents the consensus view of the working group as a whole and that it addresses a significant need that was identified during previous working group discussions.<br><br><br>*(1.f)&nbsp; Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?&nbsp; If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.&nbsp; (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is entered into the ID Tracker.)*<br><br>There are no open issues that I am aware of, nor any other outstanding areas of concern, nor are there any known issues of extreme discontent or conflict.&nbsp; <br><br><br>*(1.g)&nbsp; Has the Document Shepherd personally verified that the document satisfies all ID nits?&nbsp; (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html">http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a>.)&nbsp; Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.*&nbsp; <br><br>Yes.&nbsp; Two outstanding nits remain as follows:<br>- “There is 1 instance of lines with non-RFC2606-compliant FQDNs in the document” – this refers to the text “a1.a2.a3.a4, which is not in fact an FQDN but an address to illustrate the encoding<br>- “Missing Reference: 'ThisDocument' is mentioned on line 744, but not defined” – the three tables in the IANA Considerations section all contain a reference to [ThisDocument], which the RFC Editor will replace those with the RFC number to be assigned for this doc<br><br>Given the first is a false positive and the second will be addressed by the RFC editor, neither should prevent the document from progressing.<br><br><br>*Has the document met all formal review criteria it needs to, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews?*&nbsp;
