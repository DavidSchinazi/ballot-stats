 Protocol and its CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data<br>&nbsp;  structures, and configures the rest of the 6TiSCH communication stack<br>&nbsp;  for this join process to occur in a secure manner.&nbsp; Additional<br><br>nit: this specification does not "configure the rest of the 6TiSCH<br>communication stack" directly; perhaps "describes how to configure" is<br>more appropriate.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines a "secure join" solution for a new device,<br>&nbsp;  called "pledge", to securely join a 6TiSCH network.&nbsp; The term "secure<br>&nbsp;  join" refers to network access authentication, authorization and<br>&nbsp;  parameter distribution, as defined in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6tisch-architecture/">I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture</a>].<br>&nbsp;  The Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) defined in this document handles<br>&nbsp;  parameter distribution needed for a pledge to become a joined node.<br>&nbsp;  Authorization mechanisms are considered out of scope.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>If "secure join" includes authorization, but authorization is out of<br>scope, does this document really define a "secure join" solution?<br><br>&nbsp;

 This DoS vector on the JP can be mitigated by making the JP act as a<br>&nbsp;  stateless CoAP proxy, where "state" encompasses the information<br>&nbsp;  related individual pledges.&nbsp; The JP can wrap the state it needs to<br>&nbsp;  keep for a given pledge throughout the network stack in a "state<br>&nbsp;  object" and include it as a CoAP token in the forwarded request to<br>&nbsp;  the JRC.&nbsp; The JP may use the CoAP token as defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>], if<br>&nbsp;  the size of the serialized state object permits, or use the extended<br>&nbsp;  CoAP token defined in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-stateless/">I-D.ietf-core-stateless</a>], to transport the<br>&nbsp;  state object.&nbsp; The JRC MUST support extended token lengths, as<br>&nbsp;  defined in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-stateless/">I-D.ietf-core-stateless</a>].&nbsp; Since the CoAP token is echoed<br><br>Per [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-stateless/">I-D.ietf-core-stateless</a>], the (extended) token is hop-by-hop, so in<br>addition to the JRC needing to support extended tokens, isn't there in<br>practice a requirement that either no other proxying than join proxying<br>occurs or the proxies also support extended tokens?&nbsp; (I assume this will<br>~always be the former, since we are expecting to do direct IPv6 from JP<br>to JRC.)<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Implementations MUST ensure that multiple CoAP requests, including to<br>&nbsp;  different JRCs, are properly incrementing the sequence numbers, so<br>&nbsp;  that the same sequence number is never reused in distinct requests.<br><br>I suggest noting that this is also tied to the PSK that the pledge is<br>attempting to use to secure its communications with the JRC; the<br>sequence number space would be reset if a different PSK was provisioned<br>(as might happen if the device was transferred to a different network).<br><br>Section 7.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  memory.&nbsp;

 memory.<br><br>Just to check: is this mandating specifically the algorithm from<br>Appendix B.1.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8613/">RFC 8613</a> or just some algorithm to do so, of which the<br>referenced one is one example?<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  the case of 6LBR pledge.&nbsp; The JRC may update the parameters at any<br>&nbsp;  time, by reaching out to the joined node that formerly acted as a<br>&nbsp;  (6LBR) pledge.&nbsp; For example, network-wide rekeying can be implemented<br><br>nit: the use of the definite article "the" suggests that no parentheses<br>around "6LBR" were intended, but the next sentence suggests otherwise;<br>perhaps "the" is better as "a".<br><br>&nbsp;  This section specifies how the CoJP messages are mapped to CoAP and<br>&nbsp;  OSCORE, CBOR data structures carrying different parameters,<br>&nbsp;  transported within CoAP payload, and the parameter semantics and<br>&nbsp;  processing rules.<br><br>This sentence is pretty hard to parse.&nbsp; What is the relationship amongst<br>the items in the comma-separated list?<br><br>Section 8.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 7.&nbsp; If the CoAP at (6LBR) pledge declares the message<br>&nbsp;  transmission as failure, the (6LBR) pledge SHOULD attempt to join the<br><br>nit: I think the language used by <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> is not quite aligned with<br>this; if the max retransmissions are hit for a CON message, "the attempt<br>to transmit the message is canceled and the application process informed<br>of failure", so perhaps it's not the pledge doing so but rather the CoAP<br>stack thereupon.&nbsp;

After verifying the join request with the<br>&nbsp;  new ID Context and the derived OSCORE security context, the JRC<br>&nbsp;  should consequently take action in mapping the new ID Context with<br>&nbsp;  the previously used pledge identifier.&nbsp; How JRC handles this mapping<br>&nbsp;  is implementation specific.<br><br>I understand that this does not need to be specified in this document,<br>but might there be a need for coordination between the JRC and the<br>pledge, e.g., to change the PSK between pledge and JRC?&nbsp; (That would<br>make it "out of scope of this document" but not<br>"implementation-specific".)<br><br>&nbsp;  The described procedure is specified in Appendix B.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8613/">RFC8613</a>] and<br>&nbsp;  is RECOMMENDED in order to handle the failure events or any other<br>&nbsp;  event that may lead to the loss of mutable security context<br>&nbsp;  parameters.&nbsp; The length of nonces exchanged using this procedure<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; successfully complete the security processing of an incoming<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frame.&nbsp; To do so, the pledge can wait to receive a new frame, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it can store an EB frame that it used to find the JP and use it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for immediate security processing upon reception of the key set.<br><br>It might be interesting to have some discussion of how this relates to<br>the time verification discussion in Section 5.1.&nbsp;

Even if the node powers off<br>and suffers realtime clock skew, when it starts listening again, a valid<br>EB will give it the current ASN and it will know whether the lease on<br>the short ID is still valid.&nbsp; An attacker might replay an old valid) EB<br>in such a case and get the victim node to send traffic with an old ASN,<br>but I don't see a way for that to overlap (in terms of nonce reuse) with<br>any traffic sent by the subsequent recipient of a lease on that short<br>ID, since the new valid lease will cover a disjoint chunk of ASNs, and<br>so the nonce would not get reused by the different nodes.<br>On the other hand, if I relax this logic and have the node just trust<br>its real-time clock (without doing an ASN computation), then I think<br>there may be risk of the node going to sleep, suffering clock skew,<br>coming back online and re-learning the current ASN but erroneously<br>thinking that its lease is still valid (by wall-clock time) if it does<br>not do an ASN check.<br><br>Section 8.4.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The JRC MUST ensure that at any given time there are never two same<br>&nbsp;  short identifiers being used under the same link-layer key.&nbsp; If the<br><br>[as above, the "time" axis that is important is ASN, not wall-clock<br>time]<br><br>Section 9<br><br>We should refer to the OSCORE security considerations as also being<br>relevant for CoJP.&nbsp; I'm less sure whether we want to say something here<br>about the security properties of CoJP being dependent on the security<br>context between pledge and JRC, i.e., the PSK and use of persistent<br>storage for the mutable state in that security context, since that's<br>basically inherent to how OSCORE works.&nbsp; Perhaps it's worth saying<br>something about how the pledge and JRC share a single security context<br>for the purpose of joining, and that this context is long-lived (i.e.,<br>the entire lifetime of the 6LN).<br><br>It's probably worth reiterating that while OSCORE provides replay<br>protection, it does not necessarily provide an indication of "freshness"<br>in the face of an attacker that can drop/reorder traffic.&nbsp; We do mention<br>at least once that a misbehaving JRC could have precomputed a non-fresh<br>configuration response, and I might reiterate that here as well.&nbsp; (That<br>could be relevant if, e.g., the JRC or its key information was<br>temporarily compromised and control subsequently regained by the<br>legitimate owner.)<br><br>Maybe it's more of an "operational considerations" note than a "security<br>considerations" one, but I suggest reiterating (e.g., in the second<br>paragraph) that there is substantial operational overhead in having a<br>unique PSK between pledge and JRC, but that it is vital to<br>the security properties of the network to do so.&nbsp; (This has a fair<br>amount of overlap with what's already there, so I won't be very put out<br>if you decline to change anything.)<br><br>&nbsp;  The JP forwards the unauthenticated join traffic into the network.&nbsp;

Congestion control is supposed to avoid network overload but also to make use available resources. The congestion control as currently defined&nbsp; for CoAP would probably limit the join traffic appropriately (to something like one packet per RTT likely) but CoAP could in theory use any time a different more aggrieve congestion and therefore just relying on congestion control generically doesn't seem to be sufficient. I recommend to define a hard limit, e.g. 1 packet per RTT or 1 packet per 3 seconds if RTT is unknown (as recommended in <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a>) and say that this can be achieved by congestion control as specified in the base CoAP spec. <br>Further on there seems to be an implicit requirement that the JP MUST implement rate limit using the PROBING_RATE parameter, however, that is never explicitly spelled out as a normative requirement. However, if this rate is not provided by the JRC, it doesn't seem that any rate limiting has to be enforced. So maybe it would be good to be more strict here.<br><br><br>2) Also, not&nbsp; sure if this editorial or a real issue but I'm not sure I fully understand this sentence:<br><br>Sec 6.1.1: "A Join Proxy that does not set the DSCP on traffic<br>&nbsp;  forwarded should set it to zero so that it is compressed out."<br>If the proxy does NOT SET DSCP, why should it SET it to zero? I would think it either sets it to AF43 or it does nothing about it because DSCP is not really used in that network. I guess it's not a big issue and setting to zero seems fine as well but I'm afraid I don't understand the intent here and when exactly the Proxy is supposed to set to AF43 or bleach.<br><br><br>3) This may also be mostly editorial but just to be sure: Section 7.2 provides default values for some of the CoAP transport parameter (where 2 of 3 are the same as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>) but not for all. Why is that?<br><br><br>4 ) And then finally on references (again):<br>Given that use of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-stateless/">I-D.ietf-core-stateless</a> is recommend, I believe it should be normative (and wait for publication of that doc).</div></td>

(§5)&nbsp; Leaving key distribution/provisioning out of scope is fine, but the assumptions of the operation are not congruent.&nbsp; Given that <a href="/doc/rfc8180/">rfc8180</a> is a BCP, then it seems that this document doesn't follow the Best Practices or maybe tries to update (?) them with this new minimal security framework.<br><br>(2) Normative References<br><br>§1: "This document presumes a 6TiSCH network as described by [<a href="/doc/rfc7554/">RFC7554</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>]."&nbsp; Why are these references not Normative?&nbsp; If the content of this document is based on the descriptions in those RFCs, I believe they should be.<br><br>Also, IEEE802.15.4 seems to be important to understand in a 6TiSCH document.<br><br>(3) §5: The Normative keywords in this paragraph are out of place because the specification is already made in <a href="/doc/rfc8180/">rfc8180</a>.&nbsp; IOW, there's no need to specify here what is already specified elsewhere.<br><br>&nbsp;  In an operational 6TiSCH network, all frames MUST use link-layer<br>&nbsp;  frame security [<a href="/doc/rfc8180/">RFC8180</a>].&nbsp; The IEEE Std 802.15.4 security attributes<br>&nbsp;  MUST include frame authenticity, and MAY include frame<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality (i.e. encryption).</div></td>

How this key is<br>&nbsp;  provisioned is out of scope of this document.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Through a single CoAP request-response exchange secured by OSCORE, the<br>&nbsp;  pledge requests admission into the network and the JRC configures it<br>&nbsp;  with link-layer keying material and other parameters. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Join Request and Join Response messages defined for this purpose are to<br>&nbsp;  be used as a generic transport based on CoAP for AKE messages between<br>&nbsp;  the pledge and the JRC, through a Join Proxy. This enables bidirectional<br>&nbsp;  communication of the pledge and the JRC, triggered by the pledge. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  What AKE transports within those messages is not very relevant,<br>&nbsp;  be it PSK, RPK or cert-authenticated DH. Once AKE completes and a<br>&nbsp;  shared secret is in place at the pledge and the JRC, the join exchange<br>&nbsp;  from this draft can take place, secured with OSCORE keys derived from<br>&nbsp;  the shared secret. <br><br>Working Group Summary<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  There was a controversy on OSCORE that this draft uses.

How this key is<br>&nbsp;  provisioned is out of scope of this document.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Through a single CoAP request-response exchange secured by OSCORE, the<br>&nbsp;  pledge requests admission into the network and the JRC configures it<br>&nbsp;  with link-layer keying material and other parameters. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Join Request and Join Response messages defined for this purpose are to<br>&nbsp;  be used as a generic transport based on CoAP for AKE messages between<br>&nbsp;  the pledge and the JRC, through a Join Proxy.
