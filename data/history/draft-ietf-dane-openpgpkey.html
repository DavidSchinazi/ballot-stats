This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is<br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header? <br><br>Experimental RFC is requested, and indicated in the header. <br>Note: see item (6) ***<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This document proposes a method to publish and "locate" OPENPGP keys<br>inside the DNS. The goal of this approach is to make it easier to find<br>OPENPGP keys for email addresses.&nbsp; The document defines a "method" to<br>convert email-addres into a special normal form. that is limited but<br>is expected to cover many cases. The OPENPGP DNS record specified has <br>been allocated by an Expert Review.&nbsp; <br><br>The method of mapping email addresses into the normal form has gone<br>through number of revisions based on feedback from WG participants and<br>email community. No one claims this is a perfect solution but good<br>solution for the particular problem space, where the sender to an<br>email has a "good" idea what an email address of the receipient<br>is. This protocol can be described as oppertunistic OPENPGP key<br>discovery. This is not a replacement service for PKGP servers but a<br>compliment. <br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The main issues that the WG has discused are <br>a) is it a good idea to publish email addresses in DNSSEC signed zone? <br>b) is the role of the nomalization from strictly a normalization or an<br>obfuscation as well? <br>The consensus of the WG is that as the publicaion is by the zone owner<br>it is an opt-in policy, there is no requriement for adoption thus the<br>issue need to be addressed in the light of each organizations<br>polices, i.e this is not a protocol issue. <br><br>The second issue there is a strong consenus that the purpose of the<br>normal for is only to map email addresses into a DNS label that is<br>valid in all implementations. <br>The working group consensus is strong about advancing this document. <br><br> <br>Document Quality:<br><br><br>Early version of this&nbsp; document went through DNS expert review before<br>the DNS RR type was allocated. The editor has been real good at<br>working with people to address textual and techical issues. <br>There are number of implemenations of this protocol and some<br>deoployment where organizations have placed over 1500 keys online. <br><br>More review from email community is welcome but until the email<br>community proposes a better form of normalization rules for email<br>addresses this is the best we can do. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Document Sheperd is Olafur Gudmundsson <br>Responsible AD is : Stephen Farrell, <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG. <br><br>DS has read every version of the document, and worked with the editor<br>in addressing isuses. A extensive working group last call was<br>conducted, along with with a session at a DANE meeting where people<br>from the email community had a frank discussion about the issues and<br>scope of the document. This document has advanced as far as it can<br>inside the WG and pubishing as Proposed Standard is the the desire of<br>the WG. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>Not really. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place. <br><br>More review from email community will not hurt, but unless they have<br>an sudden insight as how to "cannonize" email address this is the best<br>we can do. <br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are are two issues that have been raised over and over again. <br>A. Do not publish email addresses in the DNS. <br>B. You are not guaranteed to find the key of the actual person you<br>want to send signed/encrypted email to. <br><br>Both of these issues have been refuted and as publication is optional<br>A. does not realy apply. For B. there conversion techique is has got<br>extensive input and improved based on that. There is not much more we<br>can do at this point to address it. <br><br>Some people have said that they would be more comfortable with the<br>document published as Experimental. The working group requests<br>publication as Standards Track but can live with Experimental status. <br>(Update: we changed to experimental.)<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why? <br><br>No IPR filed <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures. <br><br>No IPR filed <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Strong <br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough. <br><br>None <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Yes the document was reviewed by DNS RRtype Registry experts. <br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No <br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document.

Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified.

Section 7.4 therefore seems to be quite misleading. I don't see why a zone walk is necessary to do this kind of harvesting when an attacker could just send one query per entry in its dictionary. I think it would be more accurate to say that by using this mechanism, people are effectively making their email addresses public.<br><br>I also think the mechanism could facilitate pervasive monitoring as described in <a href="/doc/rfc7258/">RFC 7258</a>, as it potentially makes a whole class of entities (resolvers) into repositories of detailed data about who has communicated with whom via email. To the extent that large DNS providers keep logs about individual queries, it seems like those logs could become prime attack targets. The mechanism specified here can obviously help mitigate pervasive monitoring in other ways, but I think the draft needs to be up front about the trade-offs between potentially exposing metadata to a wider pool of entities and attackers in exchange for more easily being able to protect content.</div></td>

I will vote "Yes" once DISCUSS-points are addressed. I would rather see this experiment being done and fail (or better - succeed), than to block publication of this document because it is not perfect.<br><br>1). As per Sean Leonard/Ned Freed:<br><br>There's also - as noted by Sean Leonard - a technical glitch in the current<br>specification: The local-part is not the correct input to the hash function. A<br>canonicalization step is needed because all of these addresses are<br>equivalent:<br><br>(1) <a href="mailto:first.last@example.com">first.last@example.com</a><br>(2) first . last @example.com<br>(3) "first.last"@example.com<br>(4) "\f\i\r\s\t.last"@example.com<br><br>(2) is equivalent to (1) because CWS has no semantics, (3) is equivalent to<br>(1) because the enclosing quotes are not properly part of the address, and (4)<br>is equivalent to (1) because quoted-pairs are semantically equivalent to<br>just the quoted character.<br> <br>I believe this is the entire list, so the obvious canonicalization to use<br>on the local-part portion of an address prior to hashing is:<br> <br>(a) If the local-part is unquoted remove any whitespace (CFWS) around "."s.<br>(b) Remove any enclosing double quotes.<br>(c) Remove any literal quoting.<br><br>2). Ned Freed wrote:<br><br>&gt; First, there's no way to define a mapping of local-parts to a new set of<br>&gt; identifiers *without* effectively interpreting the local-part! If you define<br>&gt; the mapping as the draft currently does, implicit in that definition is that<br>&gt; local-parts are case-sensitive. And similarly, if you convert the local-part to<br>&gt; lower (or upper) case, you're now assuming the local-part is case-insensitive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And in the case of EAI, without some sort of normalization you're assuming that<br>&gt; different UTF-8 representations of the same string of characters correspond to<br>&gt; different recipients. (Which, as Harald Alvestrand and I both pointed out on<br>&gt; the IETF list, is technically untenable and needs to be addressed. My<br>&gt; suggestion was and is to specify that the same case-folding and normalization<br>&gt; algorithm used for IDNs also be employed here.)<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6532/">RFC 6532</a> and Section 10.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc6530/">RFC 6530</a> recommend using NFC Unicode Normalization Form.

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is<br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard is requested, and indicated in the header. <br>Note: see item (6) ***<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This document proposes a method to publish and "locate" OPENPGP keys<br>inside the DNS. The goal of this approach is to make it easier to find<br>OPENPGP keys for email addresses.&nbsp; The document defines a "method" to<br>convert email-addres into a special normal form. that is limited but<br>is expected to cover many cases. The OPENPGP DNS record specified has <br>been allocated by an Expert Review.&nbsp; <br><br>The method of mapping email addresses into the normal form has gone<br>through number of revisions based on feedback from WG participants and<br>email community. No one claims this is a perfect solution but good<br>solution for the particular problem space, where the sender to an<br>email has a "good" idea what an email address of the receipient<br>is. This protocol can be described as oppertunistic OPENPGP key<br>discovery. This is not a replacement service for PKGP servers but a<br>compliment. <br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The main issues that the WG has discused are <br>a) is it a good idea to publish email addresses in DNSSEC signed zone? <br>b) is the role of the nomalization from strictly a normalization or an<br>obfuscation as well? <br>The consensus of the WG is that as the publicaion is by the zone owner<br>it is an opt-in policy, there is no requriement for adoption thus the<br>issue need to be addressed in the light of each organizations<br>polices, i.e this is not a protocol issue. <br><br>The second issue there is a strong consenus that the purpose of the<br>normal for is only to map email addresses into a DNS label that is<br>valid in all implementations. <br>The working group consensus is strong about advancing this document. <br><br> <br>Document Quality:<br><br><br>Early version of this&nbsp; document went through DNS expert review before<br>the DNS RR type was allocated. The editor has been real good at<br>working with people to address textual and techical issues. <br>There are number of implemenations of this protocol and some<br>deoployment where organizations have placed over 1500 keys online. <br><br>More review from email community is welcome but until the email<br>community proposes a better form of normalization rules for email<br>addresses this is the best we can do. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Document Sheperd is Olafur Gudmundsson <br>Responsible AD is : Stephen Farrell, <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG. <br><br>DS has read every version of the document, and worked with the editor<br>in addressing isuses. A extensive working group last call was<br>conducted, along with with a session at a DANE meeting where people<br>from the email community had a frank discussion about the issues and<br>scope of the document. This document has advanced as far as it can<br>inside the WG and pubishing as Proposed Standard is the the desire of<br>the WG. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>Not really. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place. <br><br>More review from email community will not hurt, but unless they have<br>an sudden insight as how to "cannonize" email address this is the best<br>we can do. <br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are are two issues that have been raised over and over again. <br>A. Do not publish email addresses in the DNS. <br>B. You are not guaranteed to find the key of the actual person you<br>want to send signed/encrypted email to. <br><br>Both of these issues have been refuted and as publication is optional<br>A. does not realy apply. For B. there conversion techique is has got<br>extensive input and improved based on that. There is not much more we<br>can do at this point to address it. <br><br>Some people have said that they would be more comfortable with the<br>document published as Experimental. The working group requests<br>publication as Standards Track but can live with Experimental status. <br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why? <br><br>No IPR filed <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures. <br><br>No IPR filed <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Strong <br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough. <br><br>None <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>Yes the document was reviewed by DNS RRtype Registry experts. <br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No <br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>). <br><br>Only IANA action requested is to updat a reference upon publication of<br>this document. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>Done<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc. <br><br>ID-nits <br><br>None.<br><br></div></td>
