 successful then the server MUST return a Success 2.xx response code<br>&nbsp;  otherwise server MUST return an appropriate Client Error 4.xx or<br>&nbsp;  Server Error 5.xx response code.<br><br>Noting that this is using <a href="/doc/rfc2911/">RFC 2911</a> language, is this requirement specific to CMP over CoAP, or is this just restating CoAP behaviour.<br><br><br>(3) p 4, sec 2.4.&nbsp; CoAP Block-Wise Transfer Mode<br><br>&nbsp;  A CMP PKIMesssage consists of a header, body, protection, and<br>&nbsp;  extraCerts structures which may contain many optional and potentially<br>&nbsp;  large fields.&nbsp; Thus a CMP message can be much larger than the Maximum<br>&nbsp;  Transmission Unit (MTU) of the outgoing interface of the device.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  EEs and RAs or CAs, MUST use the Block-Wise transfer mode [<a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>]<br>&nbsp;  to transfer such large messages instead of relying on IP<br>&nbsp;  fragmentation.<br>&nbsp;  If a CoAP-to-HTTP proxy is in the path between EEs and CA or EEs and<br>&nbsp;  RA then, if the server supports, it MUST use the chunked transfer<br>&nbsp;  encoding [<a href="/doc/rfc9112/">RFC9112</a>] to send data over the HTTP transport.&nbsp; The proxy<br>&nbsp;  MUST try to reduce the number of packets sent by using an optimal<br>&nbsp;  chunk length for the HTTP transport.<br><br>It wasn't entirely obvious to me as to what entity "the server" is referring to in this paragraph.&nbsp; Perhaps worth being more specific?<br><br><br>(4) p 4, sec 2.6.&nbsp; Announcement PKIMessage<br><br>&nbsp;  If the server supports CMP Announcements messages, then it MUST send<br>&nbsp;  appropriate Success 2.xx response code, otherwise it MUST send an<br>&nbsp;  appropriate Client Error 4.xx or Server Error 5.xx response code.<br><br>I found this text very slightly confusing.&nbsp; E.g., the first part of the sentence is about supporting announcement messages, and the second part is about response codes.&nbsp; I presume that this is about replying to the register messages, but perhaps this could be made a bit clearer.<br><br><br>(5) p 4, sec 2.6.&nbsp; Announcement PKIMessage<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  A client on receiving a 2.xx success<br>&nbsp;  response without the Observe option [<a href="/doc/rfc7641/">RFC7641</a>] MAY try after some time<br>&nbsp;  to register again for announcements from the CMP server.&nbsp; Since<br>&nbsp;  server can remove the EE from the list of observers for announcement<br>&nbsp;  messages, an EE SHOULD periodically re-register itself for<br>&nbsp;  announcement messages.<br><br>Would it be helpful to define or give guidance as what sort of period is recommended here (e.g., once per day, or once per year)?<br><br><br>(6) p 5, sec 3.&nbsp; Proxy Support<br><br>&nbsp;  The CoAP-to-HTTP proxy can either be located closer to the EEs or<br>&nbsp;  closer to the RA or CA.&nbsp; The proxy MAY support service discovery and<br>&nbsp;  resource discovery as described in section 2.2.&nbsp; The CoAP-to-HTTP<br>&nbsp;  proxy MUST function as a reverse proxy, only permitting connections<br>&nbsp;  to a limited set of pre-configured servers.<br><br>Given the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> MUST, is there a definition or reference as to what is meant by reverse proxy?<br><br><br>(7) p 5, sec 3.&nbsp; Proxy Support<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  It is out of scope of<br>&nbsp;  this document on how a reverse proxy can route CoAP client requests<br>&nbsp;  to one of the configured servers.&nbsp; Some recommended mechanisms are as<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; protocol are cryptographically protected against malicious<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modifications.&nbsp; As such, UDP can be used without compromising the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; security of the CMP protocol.&nbsp; Security Considerations for CoAP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>].<br><br>Possibly a question for the SEC ADs, but would "without compromising the integrity of " be better than "without compromising the security" (given CMP does not provide confidentiality, as stated below)?<br><br><br><br>Nit level comments:<br><br>(9) p 4, sec 2.6.&nbsp;

 the response to the client.<br><br>Suggest: "reason server" =&gt; "reason, the server"<br><br><br>(10) p 5, sec 3.&nbsp; Proxy Support<br><br>&nbsp;  This section provides guidance on using a CoAP-to-HTTP proxy between<br>&nbsp;  EEs and RAs or CAs in order to avoid changes to the existing PKI<br>&nbsp;  implementation.&nbsp; Since the CMP payload is same over CoAP and HTTP<br>&nbsp;  transfer mechanisms, a CoAP-to-HTTP cross-protocol proxy can be<br>&nbsp;  implemented based on section 10 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>].<br><br>Suggest: is same =&gt; is the same.&nbsp; I also suggest starting a new paragraph from "Since the".<br><br><br>(11) p 6, sec 4.&nbsp;

 *&nbsp; A CoAP-to-HTTP proxy can also protect the PKI entities by handling<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UDP and CoAP messages.&nbsp; Proxy can mitigate attacks like denial of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; service attacks, replay attacks and resource-exhaustion attacks by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enforcing basic checks like validating that the ASN.1 syntax is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compliant to CMP messages and validating the PKIMessage protection<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before sending them to PKI entities.<br><br>Suggest "Proxy can" =&gt;

This is appropriated as interoperability is required.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction. <br><br>This document specifies the use of Constrained Application Protocol<br>&nbsp;  (CoAP) as a transfer mechanism for the Certificate Management<br>&nbsp;  Protocol (CMP) for the purpose of certificate creation and management.<br>&nbsp;  CoAP is an HTTP like client-server protocol used by various<br>&nbsp;  constrained devices in the IoT space.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>No<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br> Currently there is an open source implementation to support CMP over CoAP maintained by @David von Oheimb. I believe these do not follow the draft exactly but are based on this draft. Here are github links: <br><a href="https://github.com/siemens/LightweightCmpRa">https://github.com/siemens/LightweightCmpRa</a><br><a href="https://github.com/siemens/embeddedCMP">https://github.com/siemens/embeddedCMP</a><br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Daniel Migault is the document shepherd, Paul Wouters is the AD. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document has been through a very long WGLC over ace and lamps. We received some feed backs, but no controversies have been raised. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>It would be good to have more reviews, but that what we had. <br> <br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Both co-authors have confirmed on the ace mailing list they are not aware of any IPR. <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>NA<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>none opposed the draft, we believe&nbsp; a WG consensus has been reached.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>no<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>The nits reports <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP14</a> not being mentioned, but it is present in the draft.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>It is likely that cmp-updates will procede to the registration of .well-known/cmp. In any cas eit would be good to progress these drafts together. <br><br>More explanation: The draft uses .well-known/cmp. .well-known/cmp is indicated as temporary [iana] and cmp-updates is still a draft. I am not sure we need to wait for cmp-updates to be published, but if the draft is abandoned we may need to indicate IANA that the cmp needs to be moved to permanent after 2022-05-20 - or may be at the publication of this draft. <br><br>[iana] <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml</a><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>There is only the cmp well known URI that we should make permanent if the draft is published before cmp-updates<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>no<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>no<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.
