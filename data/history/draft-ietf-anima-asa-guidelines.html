 A typical ASA will have a main thread that performs various initial<br>&nbsp;  housekeeping actions such as:<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Define data structures for relevant GRASP objectives.<br><br>I may just be confused, but wouldn't defining a GRASP objective/data<br>structure mapping be a matter of protocol design, not something that<br>requires ongoing activity in a housekeeping or startup thread of a<br>running ASA?&nbsp; If the intent was just that the values in a predetermined<br>data structure template should be populated at this step, I would be<br>much less confused.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Obtain authorization credentials, if needed.<br><br>In a non-autonomic context, I would say that getting credentials needs<br>to be a periodic task, not something done once on startup and retained<br>indefinitely.&nbsp; It seems that in the ASA context, the situation may be<br>difference, since the authorization credentials in question are likely<br>to be (or be derived from) the device's LDevID, which might reasonbly<br>have a very long lifetime.&nbsp; On the other hand, there might also be<br>scenarios where LDevID lifetime is short-lived and certificate renewal<br>occurs often, so that the ASA would benefit from having credential<br>management be a periodic task.&nbsp; Do you think it's better to list this<br>item in the initial housekeeping or in the main loop tasks?<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 2.&nbsp; However, if ASAs require additional communication between<br>&nbsp;  themselves, they can do so using any desired protocol, such as a TLS<br>&nbsp;  session over the ACP if that meets their needs.&nbsp; One option is to use<br>&nbsp;  GRASP discovery and synchronization as a rendez-vous mechanism<br>&nbsp;  between two ASAs, passing communication parameters such as a TCP port<br>&nbsp;  number via GRASP.&nbsp; As noted above, the ACP should be used to secure<br>&nbsp;  such communications.<br><br>I agree that there is earlier text suggesting that the ACP should be<br>used for normal inter-ASA communications.&nbsp; I'm commenting here<br>specifically on the phrase "used to secure such communications".&nbsp; If the<br>ACP is providing secure communications, then why would there be a need<br>to use an additional TLS session on top of it (which is specifically<br>called out as an option in the quoted text)?&nbsp; It seems that there is<br>some additional subtlety here, in that the ACP provides some baseline<br>security property of "the communications peer belongs to the ACP" but<br>that in some cases there is a need for additional protection such that<br>the data being exchanged is visible only to the two communicating<br>endpoints in the ACP and not to any intermediate ACP nodes that it<br>traverses.<br>That's a long bit of discussion to just suggest s/used to secure/used<br>for/, but I think it's important to treat use of the word "secure"<br>carefully, as it can be interpreted in many different ways by different<br>readers when used without further qualification.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, if such management is performed by NETCONF [<a href="/doc/rfc6241/">RFC6241</a>],<br>&nbsp;  the ASA must interact with the NETCONF server as an independent<br>&nbsp;  NETCONF client in the same node to avoid any inconsistency between<br>&nbsp;  configuration changes delivered via NETCONF and configuration changes<br>&nbsp;  made by the ASA.<br><br>I will, of course, defer to my ops&amp;mgmt colleagues on this, but my<br>understanding was that the NMDA allowed for changes made "out of band"<br>from the normal management protocol and that NETCONF clients were<br>expected to be able to cope with that.&nbsp; If my understanding is correct,<br>that would suggest a slight rephrasing to something like "would<br>typically interact", rather than "must interact".<br><br>Section 3.1, 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the [...] process itself may include special-<br>&nbsp;  purpose ASAs that run in a constrained insecure mode.<br><br>In light of the other discussion on this phrase, I submit "run in a<br>restricted mode in an insecure network setting" for consideration as a<br>possible alternative.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  A mapping from YANG to CBOR is defined by [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor/">I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor</a>].<br>&nbsp;  Subject to the size limit defined for GRASP messages, nothing<br>&nbsp;  prevents objectives using YANG in this way.<br><br>I would suggest mentioning the YANG data structure extension of <a href="/doc/rfc8791/">RFC 8791</a><br>in this context of using YANG to define data structures that are<br>divorced frrom configuration or operational state.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The provisioning of the<br>&nbsp;  infrastructure is realized in the installation phase and consists in<br>&nbsp;  installing (or checking the availability of) the pieces of software<br>&nbsp;  of the different ASAs in a set of Installation Hosts.&nbsp; Installation<br>&nbsp;  Hosts may be nodes of an autonomic network, or servers dedicated to<br>&nbsp;  storing the software images of the different ASAs.<br><br>I'm a bit confused about whether the Installation Host is the target of<br>the installation operation (i.e., the software is installed on this host<br>and will/might eventually run there) or functions more as a software<br>repository, from which the software will be fetched prior to running on<br>some other node.&nbsp; The phrases "servers dedicated to storing the software<br>images" and "checking the availability of" suggest the latter, but down<br>in §6.1.1 we tak of a list of ASAs installed on "[list of Installation<br>Hosts]" and even here we talk of "installing ... software ... in a set<br>of Installation Hosts".&nbsp; It would be good to clarify which of these<br>roles are intended (or that both distinct roles are covered).<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  necessary.&nbsp; This issue is considered in detail in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ciavaglia-anima-coordination/">I-D.ciavaglia-anima-coordination</a>].<br><br>The referenced draft expired in 2016 and contains a disclaimer that [the<br>latest version] "has been issued to reactivate the document in order to<br>allow discussion within the ANIMA WG about the coordination of autonomic<br>functions", which does not exactly send a strong signal that that<br>document is a definitive source of information on this topic.<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Each ASA designer will need to consider this<br>&nbsp;  issue and how to avoid clashes and inconsistencies.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is an ASA designer even expected to be in a position to know what other<br>configuration/management tools/mechanisms the ASA might be competing<br>with?<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  8.&nbsp;  On the other hand, the definitions of GRASP objectives are very<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; likely to be extended, using the flexibility of CBOR or JSON.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, ASAs should be able to deal gracefully with unknown<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; components within the values of objectives.&nbsp; The specification<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of an objective should describe how unknown components are to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; handled (ignored, logged and ignored, or rejected as an error).<br><br>Do we want to encourage specifications of objectives to also describe<br>ways in which extension are envisioned (which should not necessarily be<br>taken as excluding other potential extension points)?<br><br>Section 9<br><br>Do we want to mention again the lack of transactional integrity in GRASP<br>(mentioned previously in §5)?<br><br>&nbsp;  ASAs are intended to run in an environment that is protected by the<br>&nbsp;  Autonomic Control Plane [<a href="/doc/rfc8994/">RFC8994</a>], admission to which depends on an<br>&nbsp;  initial secure bootstrap process such as BRSKI [<a href="/doc/rfc8995/">RFC8995</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Perhaps banal, but I'd suggest including some explicit statement of<br>"those documents describe security considerations relating to the use of<br>and properties provided by the ACP and BRSKI, respectively" as a trigger<br>to actually read them, vs just noting their existence.<br><br>It may also be prudent to reference the GRASP security considerations.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, ASAs must be designed to avoid<br>&nbsp;  loopholes such as passing on executable code, and should if possible<br>&nbsp;  operate in an unprivileged mode.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I would add "or proxying unverified commands" to "such as passing on<br>executable code", since that seems more likely to me than literally<br>sending around executable binaries and running them".<br><br>&nbsp;  A similar situation will arise if an ASA acts as a gateway between<br>&nbsp;  two separate autonomic networks, i.e. it has access to two separate<br>&nbsp;  ACPs.&nbsp; Such an ASA must also be designed to avoid loopholes and to<br>&nbsp;  validate incoming information from both sides.<br><br>This makes me think of the phrasing "the ASA must act as a trust<br>boundary between the distinct ACPs", a phrasing which might also be put<br>to use in the previous discussion of loophole avoidance as well.<br><br>&nbsp;  The initial version of the autonomic infrastructure assumes that all<br>&nbsp;  autonomic nodes are trusted by virtue of their admission to the ACP.<br>&nbsp;  ASAs are therefore trusted to manipulate any GRASP objective, simply<br>&nbsp;  because they are installed on a node that has successfully joined the<br>&nbsp;  ACP.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Thanks for stating this clearly; I think it's valuable to reiterate it<br>in this context.&nbsp;

Perhaps something like "The net result should be significant improvement in operational performance" would be better? It's also entirely possible that it was just that it's just me, so...<br><br><br>O: "In this document, we use an explicit multi-threading model to describe operations."<br>C: I think that adding something along the lines of "This is done to illustrate the concepts; implementations are free to use whatever features and methods achieve the results" or similar. Perhaps something like this could actually be added to the previous sentence ("Different programming environments support asynchronicity in different ways.")? I've often seen implementers look at the pseudo-code / requirements, and then just start coding from that, without stopping to consider if their tooling provides features / paradigms that do accomplish the same thing, but better (e.g complex even driven systems when goroutines / channels would be more idiomatic).<br><br>O: "5.&nbsp; Design of GRASP Objectives"<br>C: This is sort of a meta comment (/potentially a larger topic) -- the title of the document is: "Guidelines for Autonomic Service Agents", and the abstract says "This document proposes guidelines for the design of Autonomic Service Agents for autonomic networks." But, much of the content (including this section) feels like it isn't *really* about the design of the ASA, but more of general guidelines for AN / GRAPS / etc. <br>I fully agree that it is useful content, but perhaps the title of the document should be changed, or the non-ASA guidelines bits could all just be put in a new document?). Note that, as with all of my comments, this is just a comment / thought / suggestion (I won't be sad / offended if you disagree / reject it) <br><br>Thanks again, <br>W</div></td>

Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br><a href="https://www6.ietf.org/tools/idnits">https://www6.ietf.org/tools/idnits</a> was run in verbose mode against<br>the document and found no issues other than its usual self-issues<br>(not document issues).<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>NA: No formal languages are used, no registries referenced or created. <br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>All normative references have been published as RFC.<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No downware references.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No changes to existing RFCs.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>This document makes no requests to IANA.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>NA.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>NA.<br><br>&gt; (20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>NA.<br><br></div></td>
