If so, where<br>does it say that ISID's MUST/SHOULD be hard to guess?<br><br>- Is it clear how iSCSI names are mapped to X.509 certs<br>used in IPsec?<br><br>- Just wondering if anyone's look at the recovery features<br>to check if flipping a bit in an ecrypted packet could<br>trigger any bad behaviour?<br><br>- section 7: What if IPsec goes wrong? Any specific<br>recovery for that?<br><br>- p158/9 is it not now time to make 3DES a SHOULD and AES a<br>MUST?<br><br>- CHAP has some weaknesses, but MUST only be used here when<br>sent via IPsec, is that correct?

That's a pity.<br><br>- This is too long. It may have seemed like a good plan<br>to merge a lot into one document, but this goes beyond<br>what's useful IMO.<br><br>- There seem to be many cases of terms being used that are<br>not (well) defined.&nbsp; 4.2.3.2 refers to [SPC3] for "task<br>set" which is the basis for a bunch of definitions I can't<br>understand, not having access to [SPC3].&nbsp; And for example,<br>response fencing is all over section 4 but never defined. I<br>think a general pass for this probably would be worthwhile.<br><br>- Can you explain how a 2nd TCP connection for a session is<br>as secure as the first? I think that the login phase has to<br>be repeated but wasn't sure.<br><br>- 4.2.5 says that a connection is in full feature phase if<br>some (possibly other) connection has successfully passed<br>through the login phase. That seems to imply that only IP<br>level security can work for iSCSI (since TLS would be<br>connection specific) and that MPTCP couldn't be just<br>substutited for TCP. Is that correct? Where is that stated?<br><br>- 6.3.5 - I don't quite get the security model for session<br>reinstatement. It appears to be the case that if any user<br>that can login (if that's needed) could guess and ISID then<br>they could take over someone else's session - is that<br>right?&nbsp; If not, what prevents that occurring? If so, where<br>does it say that ISID's MUST/SHOULD be hard to guess?<br><br>- Is it clear how iSCSI names are mapped to X.509 certs<br>used in IPsec?<br><br>- Just wondering if anyone's look at the recovery features<br>to check if flipping a bit in an ecrypted packet could<br>trigger any bad behaviour?<br><br>- section 7: What if IPsec goes wrong? Any specific<br>recovery for that?<br><br>- p158/9 is it not now time to make 3DES a SHOULD and AES a<br>MUST?<br><br>- CHAP has some weaknesses, but MUST only be used here when<br>sent via IPsec, is that correct? How would an<br>implementation know that IPsec is in use?<br><br>From the secdir review [1]:<br><br>- 9.3.1 - <a href="/doc/rfc2404/">RFC 2404</a> defines HMAC-SHA-1-96 not HMAC-SHA1.&nbsp; is<br>the reference correct?<br><br>- 4.2.3.2.

That appears to be a paywalled spec - is it?&nbsp; I<br>guess there are others too.<br><br>- 2.2, "Recovery R2T" is defined by not R2T (and R2TSN is<br>used inside the definition)<br><br>- 2.2, "Third-party" - this definition is not<br>understandable.<br><br>- 4.2.2.3.2, "response fence" is used without definition<br><br>- 4.2.2.3.3, "I_T_L nexus" isn't defined.<br><br>- 4.2.2.3.4, what is a FastAbort? a TaskReporting key?<br>what are UA, TMF, ACA...<br><br>- At this point I gave up on noting use of undefined terms.<br>("TTT" was the straw for this camel's back:-)<br><br>- 4.2.4, saying that a security association can be built in<br>"many different" ways is a bad idea. Surely the only ways<br>are those for which you have defined mechanisms?<br><br>- 4.2.4, "The login PDU includes..." why is it enough to<br>say what this includes without specifying precisely what it<br>is? (I include carbon atoms but am not a diamond;-)<br><br>- 4.2.5, "...is authorized to do so..." is vague. I think<br>you mean something succeeded but you've not defined what.<br><br>- 4.2.5.2, you don't say how the length of the first<br>unsolicited burst can be negotiated.<br><br>- 4.6.2 is an odd section with no text and just one 4 line<br>subsection. So is section 5. If you're following the<br>structure of some other document(s) it'd be nice to say<br>which. (If you did, I've already forgotten;-)<br><br>- section 6, is the continuation bit "C" really needed when<br>sending over TCP?<br><br>- p95, "new public keys" registerded with IANA trips up the<br>crypto geek in me:-) suggest s/public// and the same with<br>"private key"<br><br>- 9.2.2: is SRP really in use with iSCSI?

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with<br>&nbsp; the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC 3720</a><br>&nbsp; defined the original iSCSI protocol. <a href="/doc/rfc3721/">RFC 3721</a> discusses iSCSI<br>&nbsp; Naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, <a href="/doc/rfc3980/">RFC 3980</a><br>&nbsp; added an additional naming format to iSCSI protocol. <a href="/doc/rfc4850/">RFC 4850</a><br>&nbsp; followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. <a href="/doc/rfc5048/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 5048</a> offered a number of clarifications and a few improvements and<br>&nbsp; corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.<br><br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850 and 5048 by<br>&nbsp; consolidating them into a single document and making additional<br>&nbsp; updates to the consolidated specification. This document also<br>&nbsp; updates <a href="/doc/rfc3721/">RFC 3721</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc3723/">RFC 3723</a>. The text in this document thus<br>&nbsp; supersedes the text in all the noted RFCs wherever there is a<br>&nbsp; difference in semantics.<br><br>This last call explicitly identifies these downrefs in the normative references<br>of this document:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [EUI] "Guidelines for 64-bit Global Identifier (EUI-64)",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/tutorials/EUI64.html">http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/tutorials/EUI64.html</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [FC-FS] INCITS 373-2003, Fibre Channel Framing and Signaling<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Interface (FC-FS).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [OUI] "IEEE OUI and Company_Id Assignments",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui">http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [SAM2] T10/1157-D, SCSI Architecture Model - 2 (SAM-2).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [SAM3] T10/1561-D, SCSI Architecture Model - 3 (SAM-3).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [SAM4] T10/1683-D, SCSI Architecture Model - 4 (SAM-4).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [SBC2] NCITS.405-205, SCSI Block Commands - 2 (SBC-2).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [SPC3] T10/1416-D, SCSI Primary Commands-3.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [UML]&nbsp;  ISO/IEC 19501, Unified Modeling Language<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Specification Version 1.4.2.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [UNICODE] Unicode Standard Annex #15, "Unicode Normalization<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Forms", <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15</a><br><br><br><br>The file can be obtained via<br><a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons/</a><br><br>IESG discussion can be tracked via<br><a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons/ballot/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-storm-iscsi-cons/ballot/</a><br><br><br>No IPR declarations have been submitted directly on this I-D.<br><br><br></div></td>

However their CmdSN serves as a marker of their<br>&gt;&nbsp;  position in the stream of commands. The initiator and target must<br>&gt;&nbsp;  ensure that the task management commands act as specified by<br>&gt;&nbsp;  [SAM2]. For example, both commands and responses appear as if<br>&gt;&nbsp;  delivered in order. Whenever CmdSN for an outgoing PDU is not<br>&gt;&nbsp;  specified by an explicit rule, CmdSN will carry the current value<br>&gt;&nbsp;  of the local CmdSN variable (see later in this section).<br><br>&nbsp; Shouldn't is read "initiator and target MUST ensure that<br> the task management..."?<br><br><br>Section 4.2.2.1., paragraph 9:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  The number of commands used for immediate delivery is not limited<br>&gt;&nbsp;  and their delivery to execution is not acknowledged through the<br>&gt;&nbsp;  numbering scheme. Immediate commands MAY be rejected by the iSCSI<br>&gt;&nbsp;  target layer due to lack of resources. An iSCSI target MUST be<br>&gt;&nbsp;  able to handle at least one immediate task management command and<br>&gt;&nbsp;  one immediate non-task-management iSCSI command per connection at<br>&gt;&nbsp;  any time.<br><br>&nbsp; A question about the "MAY be rejected by the iSCSI": This<br> 'MAY' with 'lack of resources' makes me wondering. If there are no<br> resources left, I have to reject any command. So what is the MAY<br> here about?<br><br><br>Section 4.2.2.1., paragraph 13:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - CmdSN - the current command Sequence Number, advanced by 1<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on each command shipped except for commands marked for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immediate delivery. CmdSN always contains the number to be<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assigned to the next Command PDU.<br><br>What happens to the CmdSN, if it wraps over? A reference to Section 10.4.<br>would be good.<br><br><br>Section 4.2.2.1., paragraph 14:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - ExpCmdSN - the next expected command by the target.

The initiator treats all commands with CmdSN<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; less than ExpCmdSN as acknowledged. The target iSCSI layer<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sets the ExpCmdSN to the largest non-immediate CmdSN that it<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can deliver for execution "plus 1" per [<a href="/doc/rfc1982/">RFC1982</a>]. There<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST NOT be any holes in the acknowledged CmdSN sequence.<br><br>What happens if there are holes?<br><br><br>Section 4.2.2.4., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  For any read or bidirectional command, a target MUST issue less<br>&gt;&nbsp;  than 2**32 combined R2T and Data-In PDUs. Any output data sequence<br>&gt;&nbsp;  MUST contain less than 2**32 Data-Out PDUs.<br><br>&nbsp; Just for curiosity: how to handled more than 2**32 PDUs?<br><br><br>Section 4.2.3.3., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  The target iSCSI layer:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  a. MUST wait for responses on currently valid target-transfer<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tags of the affected tasks from the issuing initiator. MAY<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wait for responses on currently valid target-transfer tags<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the affected tasks from third-party initiators.<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  b.

In the case of target-scoped requests<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i.e., TARGET WARM RESET and TARGET COLD RESET), all of the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; commands that are not yet received on the issuing session<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the command stream however can be considered to have<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; been received with no command waiting period -- i.e., the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entire CmdSN space up to the CmdSN of the task management<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; function can be "plugged".<br><br>&nbsp; What exactly does "plugged" mean here?

It is also an error for an initiator to send<br>&gt;&nbsp;  more unsolicited data, whether immediate or as separate PDUs, than<br>&gt;&nbsp;  FirstBurstLength.<br><br>&nbsp; It is not clear to me, at least at this point of the draft,<br> what the error handling in such a case is.<br><br><br>Section 4.2.5.3., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  As the Initiator Task Tag is used to identify a task during its<br>&gt;&nbsp;  execution the iSCSI initiator and target MUST verify that all<br>&gt;&nbsp;  other fields used in task related PDUs have values that are<br>&gt;&nbsp;  consistent with the values used at the task instantiation based on<br>&gt;&nbsp;  Initiator Task Tag (e.g., the LUN used in an R2T PDU MUST be the<br>&gt;&nbsp;  same as the one used in the SCSI command PDU used to instantiate<br>&gt;&nbsp;  the task).

Responding to<br>&gt;&nbsp;  a Text request with the F bit set to 1 with an empty (no key=value<br>&gt;&nbsp;  pairs) response with the F bit set to 0 is discouraged.<br><br>&nbsp; The first 2 lines do not make sense to me, i.e., there is<br> something missing, probably a comma?

Can you clarify this?<br><br><br>Section 7.1.5., paragraph 10:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  When either party attempts to use error recovery functionality<br>&gt;&nbsp;  beyond what is negotiated, the recovery attempts MAY fail unless<br>&gt;&nbsp;  an apriori agreement outside the scope of this document exists<br>&gt;&nbsp;  between the two parties to provide such support.<br><br>&nbsp; What does this paragraph mean?

Why is this handwaiving so<br> much?<br><br><br>Section 7.12., paragraph 6:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - During Login, any failure in negotiation MUST be considered<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a login process failure and the Login Phase must be<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; terminated, and with it, the connection. If the target<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; detects the failure, it must terminate the login with the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate login response code.<br><br>&nbsp; S/must be terminated/MUST be terminated<br><br><br>Section 9., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  Historically, native storage systems have not had to consider<br>&gt;&nbsp;  security because their environments offered minimal security<br>&gt;&nbsp;  risks. That is, these environments consisted of storage devices<br>&gt;&nbsp;  either directly attached to hosts or connected via a Storage Area<br>&gt;&nbsp;  Network (SAN) distinctly separate from the communications network.<br>&gt;&nbsp;  The use of storage protocols, such as SCSI, over IP-networks<br>&gt;&nbsp;  requires that security concerns be addressed. iSCSI<br>&gt;&nbsp;  implementations MUST provide means of protection against active<br>&gt;&nbsp;  attacks (e.g., pretending to be another identity, message<br>&gt;&nbsp;  insertion, deletion, modification, and replaying) and passive<br>&gt;&nbsp;  attacks (e.g.,eavesdropping, gaining advantage by analyzing the<br>&gt;&nbsp;  data sent over the line).<br><br>&nbsp; This 'MUST' isn't that useful here, as there is no<br> word about how this is achieved. s/MUST/must/<br><br><br>Section 9.2., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  The authentication method cannot assume an underlying IPsec<br>&gt;&nbsp;  protection, because IPsec is optional to use. An attacker should<br>&gt;&nbsp;  gain as little advantage as possible by inspecting the<br>&gt;&nbsp;  authentication phase PDUs. Therefore, a method using clear text<br>&gt;&nbsp;  (or equivalent) passwords is not acceptable; on the other hand,<br>&gt;&nbsp;  identity protection is not strictly required.<br><br>&nbsp; 'not acceptable' does this mean 'MUST NOT'?<br><br><br>Section 11.3.1., paragraph 14:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  Setting both the W and the F bit to 0 is an error.<br><br>&nbsp; what exact type of error?<br><br><br><br>Section 11.4.3., paragraph 9:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; A non-zero response field indicates a failure to execute the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; command in which case the Status and Flag fields are undefined.<br><br>What about saying this:&nbsp; '...undefined and MUST be ignored when received'?<br><br><br>Section 11.4.5.1., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; The Residual Count field MUST be valid in the case where either<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; the U bit or the O bit is set. If neither bit is set, the Residual<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; Count field is reserved. Targets may set the residual count and<br><br>&nbsp; reserved means, MUST be ignored on reception and SHOULD be<br> set to 0 when sending?<br><br><br>Section 11.5.1., paragraph 9:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; - TASK REASSIGN - reassigns connection allegiance for the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task identified by the Initiator Task Tag field to this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connection, thus resuming the iSCSI exchanges for the task.<br><br>&nbsp; What's up with the remaining values of 'Function'? Should they<br> be reserved?<br><br><br>Section 11.12.4., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; The version number of the current draft is 0x00. As such, all<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; devices MUST carry version 0x00 for both Version-min and Version-<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; max.<br><br>&nbsp; Is it intentionally to have the same version number as<br> <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC 3720</a>?<br><br><br><br>Section 13.23., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  Default is <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC3720</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; How can <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC 3720</a> be the default, if this memo is<br> obsoleting <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC 3720</a>?<br><br><br>Appendix C., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  To reduce the amount of configuration required on an initiator,<br>&gt;&nbsp;  iSCSI provides the SendTargets text request. The initiator uses<br>&gt;&nbsp;  the SendTargets request to get a list of targets to which it may<br>&gt;&nbsp;  have access, as well as the list of addresses (IP address and TCP<br>&gt;&nbsp;  port) on which these targets may be accessed.<br><br>&nbsp; Is appendix C normative?

The iSCSI protocol aims to be fully compliant with<br>&nbsp; the standardized SCSI Architecture Model (SAM-2). <a href="/doc/rfc3720/">RFC 3720</a><br>&nbsp; defined the original iSCSI protocol. <a href="/doc/rfc3721/">RFC 3721</a> discusses iSCSI<br>&nbsp; Naming examples and discovery techniques. Subsequently, <a href="/doc/rfc3980/">RFC 3980</a><br>&nbsp; added an additional naming format to iSCSI protocol. <a href="/doc/rfc4850/">RFC 4850</a><br>&nbsp; followed up by adding a new public extension key to iSCSI. <a href="/doc/rfc5048/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 5048</a> offered a number of clarifications and a few improvements and<br>&nbsp; corrections to the original iSCSI protocol.<br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes RFCs 3720, 3980, 4850 and 5048 by<br>&nbsp; consolidating them into a single document and making additional<br>&nbsp; updates to the consolidated specification. This document also<br>&nbsp; updates <a href="/doc/rfc3721/">RFC 3721</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc3723/">RFC 3723</a>.
