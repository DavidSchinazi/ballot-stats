The /32 needs to be replaced with something shorter depending on what the authors/WG intended (say a /24).<br>* RB2 seems to be advertising ES2s IPv4 address 198.51.100.2/32 instead of the prefix of the subnet while RB1 seems to be advertising the the IPv4 prefix of the ES1 subnet. One of these is wrong. Not sure which one is intended.<br>* What is the rationale for using a /112 IPv6 prefix for numbering an IPv6 link with hosts? Things like SLAAC (<a href="/doc/rfc4862/">RFC4862</a>) will not work in such links. Is there a reason the authors want to use a longer than /64? Please read <a href="/doc/rfc7421/">RFC7421</a> for advantages of using a /64 instead and to find out what things break if you do not use a /64.</div></td>
