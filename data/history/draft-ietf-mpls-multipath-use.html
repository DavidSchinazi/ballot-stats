These comments were written primarily for the benefit of the<br>operations area directors.&nbsp; Document editors and WG chairs should treat<br>these comments just like any other last call comments.<br><br>Summary:<br>This draft is on the right track but has open issues, described in the review.<br><br>I apologize for this review showing up a couple of days after the end of<br>IETF Last Call.<br><br>This draft discusses considerations for what are effectively MPLS-in-MPLS<br>tunnels for multipathing - an LSP carries another LSP, with the inner<br>(client) LSPs being distributed across multiple outer (server) LSPs that<br>use different paths.&nbsp; This draft is motivated by considerations specific<br>to MPLS-TP that complicate multipathing when one of the two MPLS instances<br>is MPLS-TP.<br><br>I consider the following to be open issues that need attention (each<br>letter is used to tag the issue in the text that follows - [B] occurs<br>multiple times, as there are multiple aspect to that issue):<br><br>[A] Summary text in Introduction appears to be wrong.<br>[B] Section 3.2 needs a summary.<br>[C] Entropy label "sandwich" seems peculiar and at least needs an explanation.<br>[D] Discussion of multipath impacts on MPLS OAM should be added to Section 4.<br><br>--- Comments on draft text<br><br>[A] Section 1 (Introduction) 2nd paragraph:<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5654/">RFC 5654</a> requirement 33 requires the capability to carry a client<br>&nbsp;  MPLS-TP or MPLS layer over a server MPLS-TP or MPLS layer [<a href="/doc/rfc5654/">RFC5654</a>].<br>&nbsp;  This is possible in all cases with one exception.&nbsp; When an MPLS LSP<br>&nbsp;  exceeds the capacity of any single component link it MAY be carried<br>&nbsp;  by a network using multipath techniques, but MAY NOT be carried by a<br>&nbsp;  single MPLS-TP LSP due to the inherent MPLS-TP capacity limitation<br>&nbsp;  imposed by MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)<br>&nbsp;  fate sharing constraints and MPLS-TP LM OAM packet ordering<br>&nbsp;  constraints (see Section 3.1).<br><br>Section 3.1 concerns carrying MPLS-TP over MPLS, whereas the above<br>exception appears to concern the reverse, and Section 4 on carrying MPLS<br>over MPLS-TP allows for MPLS LSPs that exceed component link capacity.<br>Was the exception intended to be for an MPLS-TP LSP that exceeds the<br>capacity of any single component link?<br><br>Also, "MAY NOT" is not an <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> term (for good reason - it's equivalent<br>to "MAY OR MAY NOT").&nbsp; I think "cannot" was intended her, but "MUST NOT"<br>is another possibility.<br><br>[B] Section 3.2 contains a lot of useful details, but it could really use<br>a summary at the end on the options and recommendations for meeting the<br>four requirements (this summary could be a new Section 3.3).&nbsp; It's a bit<br>difficult to discern what's going on, as I had to read this section more<br>than once in order to discern the following:<br><br>[C] In Section 3.2, use of an MPLS entropy label to meet requirement MP#1<br>requires that it be "below the MPLS-TP label" whereas, to meet requirement<br>MP#2, the MPLS entropy label needs to be "just above the MPLS-TP LSP label".<br>This combination appears to suggest "sandwiching" the MPLS-TP label between<br>two entropy labels that effectively carry the same information (albeit,<br>applied and removed at different places in the network) - was that intended?<br>This is important, as there seems to be no reasonable alternative<br>to the entropy label for meeting requirement MP#2, and the draft's<br>alternative to the entropy label for meeting requirement MP#1 is "some form<br>of configuration" - the entropy label would seem to be preferred to that<br>based on my reading of this draft and the comment in <a href="/doc/rfc5706/">RFC 5706</a> section 2.2<br>that "Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured."<br><br>[B] A summary of requirements for implementation and deployment at the end<br>of Section 3.2 would have made this much more obvious.&nbsp; That should be<br>provided in addition to addressing the above question about duplicate use<br>of the MPLS entropy label.<br><br>--- Relevant Q&amp;A based on <a href="/doc/rfc5706/">RFC 5706</a> Appendix A<br><br>I'm omitting management concerns, as both MPLS and MPLS-TP have extensive<br>management infrastructure, and this draft's notion of stacking LSPs so<br>that one instance of MPLS (or MPLS-TP) can be a server to (i.e., carry)<br>another is not novel to this draft.<br><br>A.1.1.&nbsp; Has deployment been discussed?<br><br>[B] Yes, although Section 3.2 is weak on deployment requirements (some of<br>which are implementation requirements) and could use a summary.<br><br>A.1.2.&nbsp; Has installation and initial setup been discussed?<br><br>No, although because this draft reuses existing functionality in different<br>configurations, this really reduces to the A.1.9 configuration question<br>below.&nbsp; In practice, quite a bit of operator knowledge and insight is<br>required to get initial setup right, e.g., as traffic engineering LSPs to<br>avoid congestion problems (needed to meet requirement MP#3) requires<br>significant knowledge of network structure and expected traffic flows.<br>This should be obvious to anyone who works w/MPLS, but it's probably<br>worth stating for completeness.<br><br>A.1.6.&nbsp; Have suggestions for verifying correct operation been discussed?<br><br>Yes and no.&nbsp; Section 3.2 discusses OAM, and contains this important<br>requirement for OAM traffic:<br><br>&nbsp;  An Entropy Label must be used to insure that all of the<br>&nbsp;  MPLS-TP payload and OAM traffic are carried on the same component,<br>&nbsp;  except during very infrequent transitions due to load balancing.<br><br>[D] OTOH, there is no discussion of OAM traffic for the MPLS LSP in<br>Section 4; that should be added.<br><br>A.1.9.&nbsp; Is configuration discussed?<br><br>[B] Not much. Configuration is required to meet requirements MP#3 and MP#4,<br>and is one of the options for MP#1.&nbsp; A summary of what has to be configured<br>as part of the summary at the end of Section 3.2 would be a good idea.<br><br>A.2.* [skipped, see above]<br><br>A.3 Documentation<br><br>There's quite a bit of operational material contained in this draft; a<br>separate section on operations and management considerations would not<br>be appropriate.<br><br>There is a useful implementation status section which appears to imply<br>that MPLS-TP over MPLS is not currently deployable due to absence of<br>entropy label support, and because deployed MPLS equipment does not<br>generally support multipathing.&nbsp; Nonetheless, data center experience<br>indicates significant value and widespread use of multipathing based<br>on link aggregation and ECMP; corresponding benefits can be expected<br>for use of multipathing in the Internet beyond data centers.<br><br>--- Editorial comments/nits:<br><br>- Section 3.1, after <a href="/doc/rfc5960/">RFC 5960</a> quotes:<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5960/">RFC5960</a>] paragraph 3 requires that packets within a specific ordered<br><br>Insert "Section 3.1.1., before "paragraph 3" and likewise for "paragraph 6"<br>later in the same paragraph in the draft.<br><br>- Section 3.2, requirement MP#3:<br><br>&nbsp;  MP#3&nbsp; It SHOULD be possible to insure that MPLS-TP LSPs will not be<br><br>"insure" -&gt; "ensure" or "assure".&nbsp; Surely this draft does not envision<br>operators taking out insurance policies on MPLS TP LSP behavior .<br><br>- Section 3.2, last paragraph on p.8:<br><br>&nbsp;  An MPLS-TP LSP may not traverse multipath links on the path where<br>&nbsp;  MPLS-TP forwarding requirements cannot be met.<br><br>"may not" is meaningless - I believe "MUST NOT" was intended here.<br><br>- Section 4, middle of 3rd para:<br><br>Editorial suggestions for clarity:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For those LSP that are larger than component link<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; capacity, their capacity are not integer multiples of convenient<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; capacity increments such as 10Gb/s.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For those LSPs that are larger than a component link<br>&nbsp;  capacity, the LSP capacities need not be (and often are not)<br>&nbsp;  integer multiples of convenient capacity increments such as 10Gb/s.<br><br>In particular, "are not" seems wrong, as the "integer multiples"<br>case is possible, so I changed "are not" to "need not be (and often<br>are not)" in the suggested new text.</div></td>

This document does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; specify any protocol or mechanisms, but discusses some mechanisms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; we have, how they have been used and gives recommendations on <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; how they could and should be used.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The type of RFC is clearly indicated in the document header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&nbsp; and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp;  Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and<br>&nbsp;  many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in<br>&nbsp;  very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core<br>&nbsp;  networks.&nbsp; MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be<br>&nbsp;  avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.<br><br>&nbsp;  Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be<br>&nbsp;  carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP<br>&nbsp;  compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.&nbsp; The use of<br>&nbsp;  MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing in particular to note, no controversies and the working is solidlybehind this document.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is an Informational document that has been well reviewed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; working, but not external reviews have been necessary.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As part of the working group reviews it has also been reviewed by <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the MPLS review team (MPLS-RT) prior to adoption as a working <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No specific implementation review has been done on this <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document since we don't expect any direct vendor implementations<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the document; instead the document discusses how the mechanisms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that have been implemented can&nbsp; be use. We know of operators<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that has deployed the techniques discussed in the document. <br><br>&nbsp;  The MPLS-RT reviewers has been Mach Chen, Markus Jork, David Allan<br>&nbsp;  and Carlos Pignataro.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Loa Andersson is the Document Shepherd<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Adrian Farrel is the Responsible Area Director<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Document Shepherd has reviewed the document in full three<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; times, prior to that the document were accepted as a working group<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document, in preparation for working group last cal and the updated <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document after working group last call.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The working group is behind this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The author has stated that he is unaware of any IPRs related to this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No IPRs has been filed against this document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The data-tracker list one potential IPR; however this&nbsp; is not correct.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document in a very wide sense "replaced" an earlier document that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; addressed the same issues. This document is not a direct successor of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the earlier document but has been re-worked in such away that the IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosure is no relevant for this document. The party that filed the first<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IPR has not re-disclosed for this document. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document is pretty much mainstream MPLS, and there is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; very good support for the document.&nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The requested type of RFC is Informational. This document does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; specify any protocol or mechanisms, but discusses some mechanisms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; we have, how they have been used and gives recommendations on <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; how they could and should be used.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The type of RFC is clearly indicated in the document header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&nbsp; and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp;  Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and<br>&nbsp;  many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in<br>&nbsp;  very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core<br>&nbsp;  networks.&nbsp; MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath<br>&nbsp;  techniques.&nbsp; Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be<br>&nbsp;  avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.<br><br>&nbsp;  Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be<br>&nbsp;  carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP<br>&nbsp;  compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.&nbsp; The use of<br>&nbsp;  MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing in particular to note, no controversies and the working is solidlybehind this document.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is an Informational document that has been well reviewed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; working, but not external reviews have been necessary.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As part of the working group reviews it has also been reviewed by <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the MPLS review team (MPLS-RT) prior to adoption as a working <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No specific implementation review has been done on this <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document since we don't expect any direct vendor implementations<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the document; instead the document discusses how the mechanisms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that have been implemented can&nbsp; be use. We know of operators<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that has deployed the techniques discussed in the document. <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Loa Andersson is the Document Shepherd<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Adrian Farrel is the Responsible Area Director<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Document Shepherd has reviewed the document in full three<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; times, prior to that the document were accepted as a working group<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document, in preparation for working group last cal and the updated <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document after working group last call.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The working group is behind this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The author has stated that he is unaware of any IPRs related to this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No IPRs has been filed against this document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The data-tracker list one potential IPR; however this&nbsp; is not correct.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document in a very wide sense "replaced" an earlier document that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; addressed the same issues. This document is not a direct successor of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the earlier document but has been re-worked in such away that the IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosure is no relevant for this document. The party that filed the first<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IPR has not re-disclosed for this document. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document is pretty much mainstream MPLS, and there is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; very good support for the document.&nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No such threats.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.
