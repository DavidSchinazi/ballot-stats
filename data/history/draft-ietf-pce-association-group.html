An LSP may join<br>&nbsp;  multiple association groups, of different or of the same association<br>&nbsp;  type.<br><br>Is it possible for an LSP to join multiple association groups of the<br>same type and then for configuration to be assigned to two groups in a<br>manner that conflicts?&nbsp;

 overlapping ranges for an association type.&nbsp; If a PCEP peer receives<br>&nbsp;  overlapping ranges for an association type, it MUST consider the Open<br>&nbsp;  message malformed and MUST reject the PCEP session with error type 1<br>&nbsp;  and error value 1 (PCEP session establishment failure / Reception of<br>&nbsp;  an invalid Open message).<br><br>This might be a good place to specify the&nbsp; handling if a<br>received range would cross the 0xffff boundary.<br><br>Section 6.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;
