[<a href="/doc/rfc6151/">RFC6151</a>] recommends against the use of MD5 as you've documented it.&nbsp; If you<br>need any kind of collision resistance MD5 is inappropriate to use.&nbsp; If you<br>don't care about collisions resistance, then I think you need to explicitly<br>state that in the security considerations.&nbsp; MD5 is okay to use in an HMAC<br>though, but there are better choices out there for "new" protocols.<br><br>Reference to Sean's comment with sections:<br>b. It doesn't appear that Sean Turner's comment on nonce creation was addressed in 5.2.3.4.5 and 5.2.3.5.6<br>A reference to the RFC he mentioned would be helpful.&nbsp; Here is Sean's comment:<br><br>[<a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC4949</a>]:<br><br>&nbsp;  $ nonce<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I) A random or non-repeating value that is included in data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exchanged by a protocol, usually for the purpose of guaranteeing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; liveness and thus detecting and protecting against replay attacks.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (See: fresh.)<br><br>c. Again, from Sean's review, it looks like protections of the secret key were not added in section 5.3.6.&nbsp; I think this is important.<br><br>Sean's #4: I don't see a reference to <a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>?</div></td>

Why is that "MAC" not the<br>same as a random number chosen by the relay? And that'd be<br>more robust against mobile gateways for example. Even better<br>would be an open-channel DH exchange.&nbsp; I don't understand<br>what the current design gets you.<br><br>(2) I also entirely don't get why its ok to use a fixed-width<br>48-bit MAC with a home-grown algorithm based on MD5 and no<br>agility and that page 67 says a relay "MAY skip" sometimes.<br>I'd also suspect the home-grown algorithm specified in 5.3.5<br>may have weaknesses - the gateway knows or picks all the inputs<br>up to the secret which therefore MUST be long and strong, and<br>side-channel attacks (timing) might be effective against a<br>relay. That all seems far too ad-hoc for a standard when hmac<br>exists and is better. Can you point me at where this has gotten<br>some cryptographic review?

IANA understands this to mean that the authors actually want unicast prefixes which will be used for anycast routing. <a href="/doc/rfc3513/">RFC 3513</a>, section 2.4 notes that "Anycast addresses are taken from the unicast address spaces (of any scope) and are not syntactically distinguishable from unicast addresses."<br><br>IANA believes that 7.1.1 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.0/24 for IPv4 AMT Relays."<br><br>IANA would also prefer that 7.1.2 should use similar language and we would like to propose 2001:0003::/32 as a prefix.<br><br>IANA believes that 7.2 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.1/24 as a prefix for IGMP source addresses."<br><br>In 7.3 it says "IANA has reserved UDP port number 2268 for AMT." It is not clear to IANA if the authors are asking for a reservation to be turned into an assignment or noting an action that was previously taken and does not need to be modified. IANA has examined the ports registry and can see the registration but no link to an I-D or RFC. Do the authors want the current registrant name to be replaced with this I-D and the RFC number when it is approved?<br><br>IANA also believes these prefixes should be registered in the IANA IPv4 and IPv6 Special Registries. It would be helpful if the authors could provide the basic data for the registry in addition to the prefix:<br><br>Assignment<br>Termination Date<br>Purpose<br>Contact Details<br>Routing Scope<br>Reference<br><br>The routing scope is particularly helpful for the future as IANA will use it when developing a set of RPKI objects as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6491/">RFC 6491</a>.</div></td>

IANA understands this to mean that the authors actually want unicast prefixes which will be used for anycast routing. <a href="/doc/rfc3513/">RFC 3513</a>, section 2.4 notes that "Anycast addresses are taken from the unicast address spaces (of any scope) and are not syntactically distinguishable from unicast addresses."<br><br>IANA believes that 7.1.1 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.0/24 for IPv4 AMT Relays."<br><br>IANA would also prefer that 7.1.2 should use similar language and we would like to propose 2001:0003::/32 as a prefix.<br><br>IANA believes that 7.2 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.1/24 as a prefix for IGMP source addresses."<br><br>In 7.3 it says "IANA has reserved UDP port number 2268 for AMT." It is not clear to IANA if the authors are asking for a reservation to be turned into an assignment or noting an action that was previously taken and does not need to be modified. IANA has examined the ports registry and can see the registration but no link to an I-D or RFC. Do the authors want the current registrant name to be replaced with this I-D and the RFC number when it is approved?<br><br>IANA also believes these prefixes should be registered in the IANA IPv4 and IPv6 Special Registries. It would be helpful if the authors could provide the basic data for the registry in addition to the prefix:<br><br>Assignment<br>Termination Date<br>Purpose<br>Contact Details<br>Routing Scope<br>Reference<br><br>The routing scope is particularly helpful for the future as IANA will use it when developing a set of RPKI objects as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6491/">RFC 6491</a>.</div></td>

Section 4.2.1.2 makes no statement about the version of the IGMP/MLD queries sent by the relays.&nbsp; Later sections mandate the sending of IGMPv3 or MLDv2 queries.&nbsp; Why is there a restriction on the version of the queries?&nbsp; Given that the relays are acting as IGMP/MLD Queries, should there also be discussion as to relaxation of the rules for compatibility modes?<br><br>4. Sections 4.2.1.3 and 5.3.3.5 seem to disagree on whether AMT relays must handle TEARDOWN messages.&nbsp; I suspect that 4.2.1.3 needs to be revised to be consistent with the normative description in 5.3.3.5.<br><br>5.

IANA understands this to mean that the authors actually want unicast prefixes which will be used for anycast routing. <a href="/doc/rfc3513/">RFC 3513</a>, section 2.4 notes that "Anycast addresses are taken from the unicast address spaces (of any scope) and are not syntactically distinguishable from unicast addresses."<br><br>IANA believes that 7.1.1 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.0/24 for IPv4 AMT Relays."<br><br>IANA would also prefer that 7.1.2 should use similar language and we would like to propose 2001:0003::/32 as a prefix.<br><br>IANA believes that 7.2 could be more efficiently written as "IANA has assigned 154.7.1/24 as a prefix for IGMP source addresses."<br><br>In 7.3 it says "IANA has reserved UDP port number 2268 for AMT." It is not clear to IANA if the authors are asking for a reservation to be turned into an assignment or noting an action that was previously taken and does not need to be modified. IANA has examined the ports registry and can see the registration but no link to an I-D or RFC. Do the authors want the current registrant name to be replaced with this I-D and the RFC number when it is approved?<br><br>IANA also believes these prefixes should be registered in the IANA IPv4 and IPv6 Special Registries. It would be helpful if the authors could provide the basic data for the registry in addition to the prefix:<br><br>Assignment<br>Termination Date<br>Purpose<br>Contact Details<br>Routing Scope<br>Reference<br><br>The routing scope is particularly helpful for the future as IANA will use it when developing a set of RPKI objects as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6491/">RFC 6491</a>.<br><br>Note: The actions requested in this document will not be completed<br>until the document has been approved for publication as an RFC. <br></div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The advantages and benefits provided by multicast technologies are<br>&nbsp;  well known.&nbsp; There are a number of application areas that are ideal<br>&nbsp;  candidates for the use of multicast, including media broadcasting,<br>&nbsp;  video conferencing, collaboration, real-time data feeds, data<br>&nbsp;  replication, and software updates.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of these<br>&nbsp;  applications lack multicast connectivity to networks that carry<br>&nbsp;  traffic generated by multicast sources.&nbsp; The reasons for the lack of<br>&nbsp;  connectivity vary, but are primarily the result of service provider<br>&nbsp;  policies and network limitations.<br><br>&nbsp;  Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) is a protocol that uses UDP-based<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation to overcome the aforementioned lack of multicast<br>&nbsp;  connectivity.&nbsp; AMT enables sites, hosts or applications that do not<br>&nbsp;  have native multicast access to a network with multicast connectivity<br>&nbsp;  to a source, to request and receive SSM [<a href="/doc/rfc4607/">RFC4607</a>] and ASM [<a href="/doc/rfc1112/">RFC1112</a>]<br>&nbsp;  traffic from a network that does provide multicast connectivity to<br>&nbsp;  that source.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document has received strong support from the working group and no<br>&nbsp;  major controversies exist today with this document.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp;  A number of AMT implementations exist today and significant deployment<br>&nbsp;  experience has been documented.&nbsp; This document has received thorough<br>&nbsp;  review from the working group, and many have contributed to this effort<br>&nbsp;  over the last 11+ years.&nbsp; In particular, Dave Thaler, Tom Pusateri,<br>&nbsp;  Thomas Morin and Greg Bumgardner deserve credit for most of the<br>&nbsp;  authorship of this document, and Bob Sayko, Doug Nortz and their<br>&nbsp;  colleagues at ATT deserve credit for extremely thorough review of the<br>&nbsp;  document.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  Lenny Giuliano is the Document Shepherd, Ron Bonica is the<br>&nbsp;  Responsible Area Director.<br><br>IANA Note<br><br>&nbsp; IANA Considerations<br><br>&nbsp; IPv4 and IPv6 Anycast Prefix Allocation<br><br>&nbsp;  IANA should allocate an IPv4 prefix and an IPv6 prefix dedicated to<br>&nbsp;  the public AMT Relays to advertise to the native multicast backbone<br>&nbsp;  (as described in Section 4.1.4).&nbsp; The prefix length should be<br>&nbsp;  determined by the IANA; the prefix should be large enough to<br>&nbsp;  guarantee advertisement in the default-free BGP networks.<br><br>&nbsp; IPv4<br><br>&nbsp;  A prefix length of 24 will meet this requirement.<br><br>&nbsp;  Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) has offered 154.7.0/24 for this<br>&nbsp;  purpose.<br><br>&nbsp; IPv6<br><br>&nbsp;  A prefix length of 32 will meet this requirement.&nbsp; IANA has<br>&nbsp;  previously set aside the range 2001::/16 for allocating prefixes for<br>&nbsp;  this purpose.<br><br>&nbsp; IPv4 Address Prefix Allocation for IGMP Source Addresses<br><br>&nbsp;  IANA should allocate an IPv4 prefix dedicated for use in IGMP<br>&nbsp;  messages exchanged between gateways and relays.&nbsp; This address range<br>&nbsp;  is intended for use within tunnels constructed between a gateway and<br>&nbsp;  relay, and as such, is not intended to be globally routable.<br><br>&nbsp;  A prefix length of 24 will meet this requirement.<br><br>&nbsp;  Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) has offered 154.7.1/24 for this<br>&nbsp;  purpose.<br><br>&nbsp; UDP Port number<br><br>&nbsp;  IANA has reserved UDP port number 2268 for AMT.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>Document was reviewed by the Shepherd, who feels it is ready for <br>publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>No, the document has undergone thorough review from a number of folks <br>in the WG.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization?
