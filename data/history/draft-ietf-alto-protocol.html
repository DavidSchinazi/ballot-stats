I don't really see the conflict; just because a client can ask particular questions and get particular answers, or that some of the data in the answers is dynamic, doesn't make the information any less "published". I might agree that "unidirectional" is a strange term to use, but it is certainly "read-only".<br><br>Throughout the document: I'm not a big fan of the "we" language. I think it makes it sounds like an academic paper rather than a protocol spec. I prefer "this document" or "this protocol".<br><br>6.1.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  An ALTO Client SHOULD be cognizant of operations when a<br>&nbsp;  desired Cost Mode is not supported.<br><br>I don't know what an implementer is supposed to do with that sentence. There's nothing actionable there. What I think you mean is, "An ALTO Client MUST be able to support either mode." If that's not what you mean, then I don't know what is intended here.<br>&nbsp;  <br>6.1.2.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is important to note that the values in the Cost Map provided with<br>&nbsp;  the ordinal Cost Mode are not necessarily the actual costs known to<br>&nbsp;  the ALTO Server.<br><br>I ask this seriously: Why is it important to note that? And who exactly should note that? Are you trying to tell server implementers that they MAY produce values in the Cost Map based on things other than their internal cost metrics? Or are you telling client implementers that the Cost Map may not be completely representational of...something? I don't know what that sentence means or what it's import is.<br><br>8.3.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  ...the ALTO Server MAY provide...or return an ALTO error object...<br><br>That's a strange use of MAY. Giving the answer or giving an error don't seem like "options" in the traditional sense. I'd just say, "...the ALTO Server either provides...or returns an ALTO error object..."<br><br>8.3.6: s/MAY/can There's no protocol option being described here.<br><br>10.1 (and elsewhere in the document): If you want to be precise, you might change "alphanumeric characters" to "US-ASCII alphanumeric characters".<br><br>10.3: I don't think "and 'tag' is a case-sensitive string" adds anything, and in fact it might be confusing. You don't talk about case-sensitivity anywhere in the document, and the below paragraph already talks about "byte-for-byte equal". How about simply, "and tag is is an identifier string, as described in section 6.3".<br><br>11.5.1: "It is important to note..." It seems to me that this paragraph is simply saying, "How an ALTO Server calculates costs between individual endpoints is implementation dependent. For example, an ALTO Server could simply use the cost between the PIDs corresponding to the endpoints." I suggest that replacement.</div></td>

 At a high level, the ALTO Protocol specified in this document is a<br>&nbsp;  unidirectional interface that allows a network to publish its network<br>&nbsp;  information such as network locations, costs between them at<br>&nbsp;  configurable granularities, and endhost properties to network<br>&nbsp;  applications.&nbsp; The information published by the ALTO Protocol should<br>&nbsp;  benefit both the network and the applications (i.e., the consumers of<br>&nbsp;  the information).&nbsp; Either the operator of the network or a third-<br>&nbsp;  party (e.g., an information aggregator) can retrieve or derive<br>&nbsp;  related information of the network and publish it using the ALTO<br>&nbsp;  Protocol.&nbsp; When a network provides information through the ALTO<br>&nbsp;  Protocol, we say that the network provides the ALTO Service.<br><br>But in Section 8.3.2, we have this:<br><br>&nbsp;  Where possible, the ALTO Protocol uses the HTTP GET method to request<br>&nbsp;  resources.&nbsp; However, some ALTO services provide Information Resources<br>&nbsp;  that are the function of one or more input parameters.&nbsp; Input<br>&nbsp;  parameters are encoded in the HTTP request's entity body, and the<br>&nbsp;  ALTO Client MUST use the HTTP POST method to send the parameters.<br><br>That says to me that this isn't unidirectional, and that it's not a question of "publishing" network information.&nbsp; The client is actively querying, asking for specific information, sometimes using input parameters to pass query information to the server... and the server is responding to a specific query, not publishing common information -- the response will be different for different queries, and perhaps for the same query sent by different clients.<br><br>If I'm right, that's very different from publishing information, and it has very different security, privacy, and integrity properties.&nbsp; A lot of information can be gleaned from specific queries a client might make and parameters it might use, especially when information is aggregated from many queries over time.<br><br>You do talk about risks to the client in Section 15.4.1, so I think the only issue here is that Section 1.1 is misleading.&nbsp; Perhaps a bit of rephrasing will help?<br><br>-- Section 10.6 --<br><br>&nbsp;  Identifiers prefixed with 'priv:' are reserved for Private Use<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC5226</a>].&nbsp; Identifiers prefixed with 'exp:' are reserved for<br>&nbsp;  Experimental use.&nbsp; For an identifier with the 'priv:' or 'exp:'<br>&nbsp;  prefix, an additional string (e.g., company identifier or random<br>&nbsp;  string) MUST follow to reduce potential collisions.&nbsp; For example, a<br>&nbsp;  short string after 'exp:' to indicate the starting time of a specific<br>&nbsp;  experiment is recommended.&nbsp; All other identifiers that appear in an<br>&nbsp;  HTTP request or response with an 'application/alto-*' media type and<br>&nbsp;  indicate Cost Metrics MUST be registered in the ALTO Cost Metrics<br>&nbsp;  registry Section 14.2.<br><br>These aren't really "reserved"; the idea is that anyone can freely use such identifiers without worrying about registration?&nbsp; This needs to be clear both to IANA and to implementors.&nbsp; I'm also not sure how to interpret the "MUST" here.&nbsp; The example gives a good clue, but... suppose Apple wants to use a private identifier.&nbsp; Should that be "priv:apple:myid", "priv:apple-myid", "priv:apple_myid", "priv:applemyid", any of the above?&nbsp; All "an additional string MUST follow" tells me is that I can't just use "priv:"... but "priv:x" would satisfy the MUST.&nbsp; Is that sufficiently specified for you?<br><br>Similar comment for 10.8.2.<br><br>-- Section 14.2 --<br><br>&nbsp;  Identifiers prefixed with 'priv:' are reserved for Private Use.<br>&nbsp;  Identifiers prefixed with 'exp:' are reserved for Experimental use.<br><br>Related to the comment above, this should refer to Section 10.6 for more information.&nbsp; You have a reference to 10.6 right before this, but I don't think it's enough to draw the eye there for this.&nbsp; Maybe, "As specified in Section 10.6, indentifiers prefixed with 'priv:' are for Private Use, and identifiers prefixed with 'exp:' are for Experimental use."<br><br>-- Section 14.3 --<br><br>&nbsp;  The maintenance of this registry is similar to that of the preceding<br>&nbsp;  ALTO Cost Metrics.<br><br>I'd feel lots better if you explicitly pointed to Section 10.8.2 here.&nbsp; Maybe, "The maintenance of this registry is similar to that of the preceding ALTO Cost Metrics, subject to the description in Section 10.8.2."<br><br>-- Sections 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5 --<br><br>All the new registries use IETF Review as their policy.&nbsp; They do give a reason for that (thanks!), and I accept that reason.&nbsp; I just have one question: is there really no desire for a provision for other SDOs, such as W3C, to create new entries?&nbsp; Is the desire really for them to go through the IETF in the event that they want to do that?&nbsp; You're probably fine here, but because this sort of requirement often paints us into a corner, I wanted to double check (or triple, or...).</div></td>

As usual, I<br>appreciate the "Manageability Considerations" section, which provides<br>useful guidance.<br><br>For the monitoring part (16.1.4.), the document refers to<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-alto-deployments/">I-D.ietf-alto-deployments</a>]. While this I-D provides more discussion,<br>it still leaves it somewhat open how to effectively monitor the impact<br>ALTO has on the traffic. It seems difficult to me, within an ISP<br>network, to separate flows that are influences by an ALTO server from<br>other flows. The assumption that ALTO-enabled applications provide<br>that information back to an ISP running ALTO servers sounds a bit<br>idealistic to me. I also believe it is useful to distinguish<br>'measurement' from 'monitoring'. One likes to measure the impact an<br>ALTO server has on the traffic mix and one monitors the ALTO servers<br>whether they provides say function properly and achieve acceptable<br>response times.<br><br>Section 16.2.3. says "Monitoring ALTO Servers and Clients is described<br>in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-alto-deployments/">I-D.ietf-alto-deployments</a>]". Appendix A of this I-D talks about<br>monitoring (actually measuring) the effects of ALTO, but it does not<br>really talk about monitoring of ALTO servers or clients (e.g., is my<br>ALTO server getting overloaded?).

If not, this may be an indication that<br>there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; The specification process has been particularly long and<br>&nbsp; articulated. The WG had to make many decisions -- the architectural<br>&nbsp; ones reflected in the related requirements document -- that took<br>&nbsp; time. However, quite broad consensus was reached on almost all of<br>&nbsp; them.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; Implementations: three implementations with some interoperability<br>&nbsp; were demostrated during a "running code show" organized at<br>&nbsp; IETF80. Seven client and five server implementations were tested in<br>&nbsp; an "interoperability event" at IETF81, with pretty good results<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/alto/current/msg01181.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/alto/current/msg01181.html</a>). A<br>&nbsp; second interoperability event was arranged during IETF85, were four<br>&nbsp; server and two client implementations were tested against 21 test<br>&nbsp; cases, with again good success rates (last slide of<br>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-alto-0.pdf">http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-alto-0.pdf</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; Expert supervision: since the protocol, despite being developed in<br>&nbsp; TSV, is an application level protocol, based on HTTP and following a<br>&nbsp; REST-ful approach, Peter Saint-Andre (also former responsible AD for<br>&nbsp; ALTO, before the WG was moved to TSV) was appointed as APPS expert<br>&nbsp; and has supervised the specification process in its crucial phases<br>&nbsp; (Peter stepped back as Tech advisor at a later phase). Other experts<br>&nbsp; from APPS (Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov), SEC (Richard Barnes,<br>&nbsp; Hannes Tshofenig) and OPS (David Harrington, Benoit Claise) have at<br>&nbsp; some point been involved and provided feedback on various aspects.<br><br>&nbsp; Ted Hardie kindly provided a early apps-dir review<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html</a>)<br>&nbsp; that helped in improving the document quality quite a lot.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request, no issues were raised.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Enrico Marocco is the document shepherd, Spencer Dawkins is the<br>&nbsp; responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has followed the specification process<br>&nbsp; closely, implementing a proof-of-concept client application himself<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/">http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/</a>). He has proofread the final<br>&nbsp; version of the document and believes it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Each and every word has been read by litteraly hundreds of<br>&nbsp; eyes. However, the document shepherd believes that additional<br>&nbsp; external reviews (e.g. apps-dir and/or gen-art) would be beneficial,<br>&nbsp; esp. to spot areas in the document that may turn out unclear to the<br>&nbsp; unexperienced reader.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; The document specifies an HTTP-based application layer protocol,<br>&nbsp; following the best practices generally referenced as REST-ful and<br>&nbsp; requesting the registration of several media types. All these<br>&nbsp; aspects have been approached under the supervision of APPS experts<br>&nbsp; (Peter Saint-Andre, Martin Thomson, Richard Barnes, Alexey<br>&nbsp; Melnikov) and should probably be re-checked for consistency. The<br>&nbsp; document has also received a review from OPS perspective (from<br>&nbsp; Benoit Claise).<br><br>&nbsp; Ted Hardie kindly provided a early apps-dir review<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html</a>)<br>&nbsp; that helped in improving the document quality quite a lot.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request no issues were raised.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; According to the document shepherd the document is good. In<br>&nbsp; particulary, all that could be removed has been removed.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; The authors (at the time of publication request) are not aware of<br>&nbsp; any IPR on the document and believe that it is compliant with IETF<br>&nbsp; copyright and IPR policy rules.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR disclosure references this document. Two IPR disclosures<br>&nbsp; (#1628 and #1718) were filed regarding proposed extensions to the<br>&nbsp; protocol, but the WG decided not to integrate them in the base<br>&nbsp; specs.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; Strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; IDnits only returns a bunch of tabulation warnings, regarding<br>&nbsp; pseudo-code intdentation.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Media types are being nailed down under the supervision of the APPS<br>&nbsp; tech advisor and with the help of APPS experts.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request no issues were raised.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. Please note that this specification heavily relies on JSON,<br>&nbsp; currently defined in the soon-to-be-updated Informational <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 4627</a>. Such reference, despite normative in nature, is at this point<br>&nbsp; listed as informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; The document builds up on JSON specs (currently <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC 4627</a>), de-facto<br>&nbsp; standard despite being defined in an Informational RFC. A fix for<br>&nbsp; such an incostincency is being worked on in the JSON WG.<br>&nbsp; Pragmatically the WG does not see any issue with referencing <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 4627</a> in either the normative section or informative<br>&nbsp; section. Updating the reference and adding a normative dependency to<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis/">draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis</a> seems less desirable as it would delay<br>&nbsp; the publication indefinitely. The process-wise decision is anyway<br>&nbsp; deferred to the IESG.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; With the exception of the potentialy issue described in (14), there<br>&nbsp; are no downrefs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests registration of ten media types and the<br>&nbsp; creation of four registries.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides<br>&nbsp; network information (e.g., basic network location structure,<br>&nbsp; preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network<br>&nbsp; resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving<br>&nbsp; application performance.&nbsp; The basic information of ALTO is based on<br>&nbsp; abstract maps of a network.&nbsp; These maps provide a simplified view,<br>&nbsp; yet enough information about a network for applications to<br>&nbsp; effectively utilize them.&nbsp; Additional services are built on top the<br>&nbsp; maps.<br><br>&nbsp; This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.<br>&nbsp; Although the ALTO service would primarily be provided by the network<br>&nbsp; operator (e.g., an ISP), content providers and third parties could<br>&nbsp; also operate this service.&nbsp; Applications that could use this service<br>&nbsp; are those that have a choice in connection endpoints.&nbsp; Examples of<br>&nbsp; such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery<br>&nbsp; networks.<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or<br>introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that<br>there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; The specification process has been particularly long and<br>&nbsp; articulated. The WG had to make many decisions -- the architectural<br>&nbsp; ones reflected in the related requirements document -- that took<br>&nbsp; time. However, quite broad consensus was reached on almost all of<br>&nbsp; them.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; Implementations: three implementations with some interoperability<br>&nbsp; were demostrated during a "running code show" organized at<br>&nbsp; IETF80. Seven client and five server implementations were tested in<br>&nbsp; an "interoperability event" at IETF81, with pretty good results<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/alto/current/msg01181.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/alto/current/msg01181.html</a>). A<br>&nbsp; second interoperability event was arranged during IETF85, were four<br>&nbsp; server and two client implementations were tested against 21 test<br>&nbsp; cases, with again good success rates (last slide of<br>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-alto-0.pdf">http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/85/slides/slides-85-alto-0.pdf</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; Expert supervision: since the protocol, despite being developed in<br>&nbsp; TSV, is an application level protocol, based on HTTP and following a<br>&nbsp; REST-ful approach, Peter Saint-Andre (also former responsible AD for<br>&nbsp; ALTO, before the WG was moved to TSV) was appointed as APPS expert<br>&nbsp; and has supervised the specification process in its crucial phases<br>&nbsp; (Peter stepped back as Tech advisor at a later phase). Other experts<br>&nbsp; from APPS (Martin Thomson, Alexey Melnikov), SEC (Richard Barnes,<br>&nbsp; Hannes Tshofenig) and OPS (David Harrington, Benoit Claise) have at<br>&nbsp; some point been involved and provided feedback on various aspects.<br><br>&nbsp; Ted Hardie kindly provided a early apps-dir review<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html</a>)<br>&nbsp; that helped in improving the document quality quite a lot.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request, no issues were raised.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Enrico Marocco is the document shepherd, Spencer Dawkins is the<br>&nbsp; responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has followed the specification process<br>&nbsp; closely, implementing a proof-of-concept client application himself<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/">http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/</a>). He has proofread the final<br>&nbsp; version of the document and believes it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Each and every word has been read by litteraly hundreds of<br>&nbsp; eyes. However, the document shepherd believes that additional<br>&nbsp; external reviews (e.g. apps-dir and/or gen-art) would be beneficial,<br>&nbsp; esp. to spot areas in the document that may turn out unclear to the<br>&nbsp; unexperienced reader.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; The document specifies an HTTP-based application layer protocol,<br>&nbsp; following the best practices generally referenced as REST-ful and<br>&nbsp; requesting the registration of several media types. All these<br>&nbsp; aspects have been approached under the supervision of APPS experts<br>&nbsp; (Peter Saint-Andre, Martin Thomson, Richard Barnes, Alexey<br>&nbsp; Melnikov) and should probably be re-checked for consistency. The<br>&nbsp; document has also received a review from OPS perspective (from<br>&nbsp; Benoit Claise).<br><br>&nbsp; Ted Hardie kindly provided a early apps-dir review<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg05406.html</a>)<br>&nbsp; that helped in improving the document quality quite a lot.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request no issues were raised.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; According to the document shepherd the document is good. In<br>&nbsp; particulary, all that could be removed has been removed.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; The authors (at the time of publication request) are not aware of<br>&nbsp; any IPR on the document and believe that it is compliant with IETF<br>&nbsp; copyright and IPR policy rules.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR disclosure references this document. Two IPR disclosures<br>&nbsp; (#1628 and #1718) were filed regarding proposed extensions to the<br>&nbsp; protocol, but the WG decided not to integrate them in the base<br>&nbsp; specs.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; Strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; IDnits only returns a bunch of tabulation warnings, regarding<br>&nbsp; pseudo-code intdentation.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Media types are being nailed down under the supervision of the APPS<br>&nbsp; tech advisor and with the help of APPS experts.<br><br>&nbsp; A Media Type review was requested on <a href="mailto:media-types@ietf.org">media-types@ietf.org</a>, but was<br>&nbsp; never formally performed. However, in some private exchages<br>&nbsp; triggered by the review request no issues were raised.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. Please note that this specification heavily relies on JSON,<br>&nbsp; currently defined in the soon-to-be-updated Informational <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 4627</a>. Such reference, despite normative in nature, is at this point<br>&nbsp; listed as informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; The document builds up on JSON specs (currently <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC 4627</a>), de-facto<br>&nbsp; standard despite being defined in an Informational RFC. A fix for<br>&nbsp; such an incostincency is being worked on in the JSON WG.<br>&nbsp; Pragmatically the WG does not see any issue with referencing <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 4627</a> in either the normative section or informative<br>&nbsp; section. Updating the reference and adding a normative dependency to<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis/">draft-ietf-json-rfc4627bis</a> seems less desirable as it would delay<br>&nbsp; the publication indefinitely. The process-wise decision is anyway<br>&nbsp; deferred to the IESG.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; With the exception of the potentialy issue described in (14), there<br>&nbsp; are no downrefs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests registration of ten media types and the<br>&nbsp; creation of four registries. All IANA actions have been carefully<br>&nbsp; ponderated, in accordance to guidelines in <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; The document defines four new registries: an ALTO Cost Metric<br>&nbsp; Registry, an ALTO Endpoint Property Type Registry, an ALTO Address<br>&nbsp; Type Registry and an ALTO Error Code Registry. This is the minimum<br>&nbsp; set identified in the working group for achieving proper<br>&nbsp; extensibility of the new protocol. The review process identified at<br>&nbsp; this point for future allocations is "IETF Review".<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; No automated checks were required other than IDnits.<br></div></td>

This reads such as traceroute, but<br>rather a 'applications using the network' would say that we talk more<br>about apps like p2p, jabber, etc.<br> - I am not sure that 'great amount' is the right term, as there is such<br>information available, but whether it is great amount or not is<br>questionable. How about just saying 'access to inter-provider'<br> - s/routing table are easy/routing table are available. Otherwise we<br>can debate what is easy is and what skill you need to have to have it<br>easiy. The 'easy' here is also in sharp contrast to Section 1.1 of this<br>draft -- as this doesn't read that it is so easy.<br><br><br>INTRODUCTION, paragraph 5:<br><br>&gt; servers and entirely practical to be downloaded by clients.&nbsp; What is<br>&gt; missing is knowledge of the underlying network topology from the ISP<br>&gt; or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.<br>&gt; In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic<br>&gt; optimization -- and a way to distribute it.<br><br>&nbsp; Expand 'ISP'<br><br><br>INTRODUCTION, paragraph 6:<br><br>&gt; The ALTO Service provides network information (e.g., basic network<br>&gt; location structure, preferences of network paths) with the goal of<br>&gt; modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or<br>&gt; improving application performance.&nbsp; The basic information of ALTO is<br>&gt; based on abstract maps of a network.&nbsp; These maps provide a<br>&gt; simplified view, yet enough information about a network for<br>&gt; applications to effectively utilize them.&nbsp; Additional services are<br>&gt; built on top the maps.<br><br>&nbsp; Please expand ALTO on its first use in the title of the draft,<br>&nbsp; here, and also later on in the introduction.<br><br><br>INTRODUCTION, paragraph 7:<br><br>&gt; This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service.<br>&gt; Although the ALTO service would primarily be provided by the network<br>&gt; operator (e.g., an ISP), content providers and third parties could<br>&gt; also operate this service.&nbsp; Applications that could use this service<br>&gt; are those that have a choice in connection endpoints.&nbsp; Examples of<br>&gt; such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery<br>&gt; networks.<br><br>&nbsp; A nit, just to avoid any doubt: 'have a choice in connection<br>&nbsp; endpoints' sounds like you already have a connection to the other<br>&nbsp; endpoint in order to apply ALTO. I would propose to change it to<br>&nbsp; 'have a choice in endpoints to connect to'.<br><br><br>Section 1.1., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt; The goal of this document is to specify a simple and unified<br>&gt; protocol that meets the ALTO requirements [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-alto-reqs/">I-D.ietf-alto-reqs</a>] while<br>&gt; providing<br><br>&nbsp; Do we have reached the goal? If your answer is 'no', the document<br>&nbsp; isn't worth the publication as RFC. If you say 'yes' we should say<br>&nbsp; 'This document is defining the ALTO protocol...'. You could add<br>&nbsp; more words about how the ALTO protocol materialized, but in<br>&nbsp; something like Section 1.2, but in an appendix. See also next<br>&nbsp; comment.<br><br><br>Section 1.1., paragraph 4:<br><br>&gt; a migration path for Internet Service Providers (ISP), Content<br>&gt; Providers, and clients that have deployed protocols with similar<br>&gt; intentions (see Section 1.2).<br><br>&nbsp; I cannot see out of Section 1.2 why migration is supported or not<br>&nbsp; supported by the protocol. Do you really need to say this here?<br><br><br>Section 1.1., paragraph 5:<br><br>&gt; The ALTO Protocol design uses a REST-ful design with the goal of<br>&gt; leveraging current HTTP [<a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a>] implementations and<br>&gt; infrastructure.<br><br>&nbsp; REST-ful is well-known in the HTTP/HTML-community, but in other<br>&nbsp; fields not. Adding a reference to it would be very beneficially.<br><br><br>Section 1.1., paragraph 6:<br><br>&gt; The REST-ful design supports flexible deployment strategies and<br>&gt; provides extensibility.&nbsp; ALTO requests and responses are encoded<br>&gt; with JSON [<a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC4627</a>].<br><br>&nbsp; There will be confusion by reads that have not been participating<br>&nbsp; in ALTO about what the ALTO service is and what the ALTO protocol<br>&nbsp; is. This could need some clarifying words.<br><br><br>Section 1.3., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; At a high level, the ALTO Service allows a Service Provider (e.g.,<br>&gt; an ISP) to publish information about network locations and costs<br>&gt; between them at configurable granularities.<br><br>&nbsp; The abstract makes a definition which isn't re-used here: 'ISP or<br>&nbsp; Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider)'. Why is this<br>&nbsp; definition not repeated in the early parts of the introduction.<br><br><br>Section 1.3., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt; The ALTO Service offers many benefits to both end-users (consumers<br>&gt; of the service) and Internet Service Providers (providers of the<br>&gt; service).<br><br>&nbsp; I am not sure whether this Section 1.3 is only marketing and has<br>&nbsp; real value. But what is the value of, e.g., 'offers many benefits<br>&nbsp; to both end-users' if there is no list of proven benefits?<br><br><br>Section 1.3.1., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; The ALTO Service enables Service Providers to influence the peer or<br>&gt; resource selection process in distributed applications in order to<br>&gt; increase locality of traffic, improve user-experience, amongst<br>&gt; others.&nbsp; It also helps ISPs to efficiently manage traffic that<br>&gt; traverses more expensive links such as transit and backup links,<br>&gt; thus allowing a better provisioning of the networking<br>&gt; infrastructure.<br><br>&nbsp; To be honestly: I am not that confident that 'enable' (1st sentence)<br>&nbsp; or 'ISPs to efficiently manage traffic' are the right language<br>&nbsp; here. The ALTO protocol is a tool that allows ISPs to interact<br>&nbsp; with apps with the goal of . The text above reads like<br>&nbsp; that ISPs can turn knobs in p2p apps which isn't true. There is<br>&nbsp; the possibility to do this and therefore my comment<br><br><br>Section 1.3.2., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; Applications that use the ALTO Service can benefit in multiple ways.<br>&gt; For example, they may no longer need to infer topology information,<br>&gt; and some applications can reduce reliance on measuring path<br>&gt; performance metrics themselves.&nbsp; They can take advantage of the<br>&gt; ISP's knowledge to avoid bottlenecks and boost performance.<br><br>&nbsp; The message of this Section is perfect and should be a guiding<br>&nbsp; example for Section 1.3.1.<br><br><br>Section 2.1.4., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; Network Location is a generic term denoting a single endpoint or<br>&gt; group of endpoints.<br><br>&nbsp; I would add: "For instance, it can be a single IPv4 address, an<br>&nbsp; IPv4 prefix, or a set of IPv4 prefixes". Just to make it clear to<br>&nbsp; any reader.<br><br><br>Section 2.2., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; An ALTO Server conveys the network information from the perspective<br>&gt; of a network region; the ALTO Server presents its "my-Internet View"<br>&gt; of the network region.&nbsp; In particular, an ALTO Server defines<br>&gt; network Endpoints (and aggregations thereof) and generic costs<br>&gt; amongst them from the network region's own perspective.&nbsp; A network<br>&gt; region in this context can be an Autonomous System, an ISP, or<br>&gt; perhaps a smaller region or set of ISPs; the details depend on the<br>&gt; ALTO deployment scenario and ALTO service discovery mechanism.<br><br>&nbsp; Why does the "my-Internet View" depend on the scenario or srv<br>&nbsp; discovery mechanism? I know what you are targeting, but I find it<br>&nbsp; misleading. The primary reason is that 'somebody' is defining the<br>&nbsp; "my-Internet View". However, depending which server you ask you<br>&nbsp; will see a different instance of the "my-Internet View".<br><br><br>Section 2.2., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt; To better understand the ALTO Service and the role of the ALTO<br>&gt; Protocol, we show in Figure 1 the overall ALTO system architecture.<br>&gt; In this architecture, an ALTO Server prepares ALTO Information; an<br>&gt; ALTO Client uses ALTO Service Discovery to identify an appropriate<br>&gt; ALTO Server; and the ALTO Client requests available ALTO Information<br>&gt; from the ALTO Server using the ALTO Protocol.<br><br>&nbsp; I like this paragraph and I would only suggest to replace the<br>&nbsp; 'ALTO Protocol' line in Figure 1 with some characters which make<br>&nbsp; this line better visible, e.g., using '=' instead of '-'.<br><br><br>Section 2.2., paragraph 4:<br><br>&gt; More specifically, the ALTO Information provided by an ALTO Server<br>&gt; may be influenced (at the operator's discretion) by other systems.<br>&gt; The ALTO Server aggregates information from multiple systems to<br><br>&nbsp; Since the sentence about says 'may be influenced' it might better<br>&nbsp; to write here 'The ALTO Server can aggregate'. It is a nit, but<br>&nbsp; there is no need that has always to aggregate information, but it<br>&nbsp; is able to do so, if needed.<br><br><br>Section 2.2., paragraph 6:<br><br>&gt; It may also be possible for ALTO Servers to exchange network<br>&gt; information with other ALTO Servers (either within the same<br>&gt; administrative domain or another administrative domain with the<br>&gt; consent of both parties) in order to adjust exported ALTO<br>&gt; Information.&nbsp; Such a protocol is also outside the scope of this<br>&gt; specification.<br><br>&nbsp; So, after this section, what is the ALTO service?<br><br><br><br>Section 2.3., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt; Beyond integration with existing HTTP caching infrastructure, ALTO<br>&gt; information may also be cached or redistributed using application-<br>&gt; dependent mechanisms, such as P2P DHTs or P2P file-sharing.&nbsp; This<br>&gt; document does not define particular mechanisms for such<br>&gt; redistribution.&nbsp; See [<a href="/doc/draft-gu-alto-redistribution/">I-D.gu-alto-redistribution</a>] for further<br>&gt; discussion.<br><br>&nbsp; I would remove the reference [<a href="/doc/draft-gu-alto-redistribution/">I-D.gu-alto-redistribution</a>], as this<br>&nbsp; didn't progress.<br><br><br>Section 2.3., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt; Additional protocol mechanisms (e.g., expiration times and digital<br>&gt; signatures for returned ALTO information) are left for extension<br><br>&nbsp; a proposal: s/left for extension/left for future investigation/<br><br><br>Section 3., paragraph 0:<br><br> 3.&nbsp; Service Framework<br><br>&nbsp; shouldn't it read 'ALTO Service Framework'? Just to be precise.<br><br><br>Section 3., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt; The ALTO Protocol is built on a common transport protocol, messaging<br>&gt; structure and encoding, and transaction model.&nbsp; The protocol is<br>&gt; subdivided into services of related functionality.&nbsp; The Map Service<br>&gt; provides the core ALTO information to clients.&nbsp; Other ALTO<br>&gt; Information services provide additional functionalities.&nbsp; There are<br>&gt; three such services defined in this document: the Map Filtering<br>&gt; Service, Endpoint Property Service, and Endpoint Cost Service.<br>&gt; Additional services may be defined in companion documents.<br><br>&nbsp; s/may be defined/can be defined/.<br><br><br>Section 3., paragraph 4:<br><br>&gt; Functionalities offered in different services may overlap (e.g., the<br>&gt; Map Service and Map Filtering Service).<br><br>&nbsp; s/may overlap/can overlap/. Even though may would be also Ok,<br>&nbsp; as the it is allowed to have overlapping functionality.<br><br><br>Section 3.1.3., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; This service allows ALTO Clients to look up properties for<br>&gt; individual Endpoints.&nbsp; An example endpoint property is its Network<br>&gt; Location (its grouping defined by the ALTO Server) or connectivity<br>&gt; type (e.g., ADSL, Cable, or FTTH).<br><br>&nbsp; Expand 'ADSL' and 'FTTH' here.<br><br><br>Section 4., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; The Network Location Endpoint Property allows an ALTO Server to<br>&gt; group endpoints together to indicate their proximity.&nbsp; The resulting<br>&gt; set of groupings is called the ALTO Network Map.<br><br>&nbsp; 'The resulting' means 'the resulting set of Network Location Endpoint<br>&nbsp; Properties',isn't it? Better to spell it out.<br><br><br>Section 4., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt; The definition of proximity varies depending on the granularity of<br>&gt; the ALTO information configured by the provider.&nbsp; In one deployment,<br>&gt; endpoints on the same subnet may be considered close; while in<br>&gt; another deployment, endpoints connected to the same PoP may be<br>&gt; considered close.<br><br>&nbsp; Expand 'PoP'<br><br><br>Section 4.1., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; Each group of Endpoints is identified by a provider-defined Network<br>&gt; Location identifier called a PID.&nbsp; A PID is a US-ASCII string of<br>&gt; type<br><br>&nbsp; Expand PID in the text and also in the section heading. <br><br>Section 5., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt; An ALTO Cost Map defines Path Costs pairwise amongst sets of source<br>&gt; and destination Network Locations.&nbsp; Each Path Cost is the end-to-end<br>&gt; cost from the source to the destination.<br><br>&nbsp; Isn't the costed defined between PIDs and not the Network<br>&nbsp; Locations? Just to ensure that the correct terminology is being used.<br><br><br>Section 5.1.2., paragraph 4:<br><br>&gt; An ALTO Server MUST support at least one of 'numerical' and<br>&gt; 'ordinal' costs.&nbsp; ALTO Clients SHOULD be cognizant of operations when<br>&gt; a desired cost mode is not supported.&nbsp; For example, an ALTO Client<br>&gt; desiring<br><br>&nbsp; The 'ALTO Clients SHOULD be' isn't correct, as it is not a protocol<br>&nbsp; issue but more it should read 'ALTO Clients should be', in oder<br>&nbsp; to let people know that this can happen. On the other hand, would<br>&nbsp; it make a big difference if the both, 'numerical' and 'ordinal',<br>&nbsp; are supported, i.e., 'MUST support both'?<br><br><br><br>Section 5.2., paragraph 4:<br><br>&gt; If the Cost Mode is 'ordinal', the Path Cost of each communicating<br>&gt; pair is relative to the m*n entries.<br><br>&nbsp; What is the 'm*n entries'? It has not been used before, nor<br>&nbsp; defined. I do know what it is, but an stranger to ALTO does not.<br><br><br>Section 5.3., paragraph 2:<br><br>&gt; A Version Tag is an opaque string associated with a Network Map<br>&gt; maintained by the ALTO Server.&nbsp; When the Network Map changes, the<br>&gt; Version Tag MUST also be changed.&nbsp; (Thus, the Version Tag is defined<br>&gt; similarly to HTTP's Entity Tags; see Section 3.11 of [<a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a>].)<br>&gt; Possibilities for generating a Version Tag include the last-modified<br>&gt; timestamp for the Network Map, or a hash of its contents.<br><br>&nbsp; Is there any required to never ever have the same version tag?

Byte-wise?<br><br><br>Section 6.3.4.2., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; If an ALTO Client does not successfully receive a desired<br>&gt; Information Resource from a particular ALTO Server, it can either<br>&gt; choose another server (if one is available) or fall back to a default<br>&gt; behavior (e.g., perform peer selection without the use of ALTO<br>&gt; information). An ALTO Client may also retry the request at a later<br>&gt; time.<br><br>&nbsp; A suggestion to change this to improve readability/giving a better<br>&nbsp; context to the reader that it is about p2p:<br> OLD<br> (e.g., perform peer selection without the use of ALTO information).<br> NEW<br> (e.g., perform peer selection without the use of ALTO information, if<br>used with a peer-to-peer system).<br><br><br>Section 6.3.5., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; An ALTO Server MAY support SSL/TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>] to implement server<br>&gt; and/or client authentication, encryption, and/or integrity<br>&gt; protection.&nbsp; See [<a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC6125</a>] for considerations regarding verification<br>&gt; of server identity.<br><br>&nbsp; This will raise questions from the security point of view.

The current specification is<br>&nbsp; relative dangerous, as it only says 'use priv: for your private use'<br>&nbsp; and add something afterwards. However, there is the likely risk that<br>&nbsp; two implementers choose the same tag after 'priv:'. In order to avoid<br>&nbsp; that, the specification should mandate that, if somebody wants to use<br>&nbsp; this type of extension you MUST append a further tag, e.g., company<br>&nbsp; name or random string, to the 'priv:' or 'exp:' tags to make them<br>&nbsp; unique. For experiments I would recommend to make the recommendation<br>&nbsp; use a short randomstring the start time of the experiement.<br><br><br>Section 6.7., paragraph 3:<br><br>&gt; An ALTO Server MUST make an Information Resource Directory available<br>&gt; via the HTTP GET method to a URI discoverable by an ALTO Client.<br>&gt; Discovery of this URI is out of scope of this document, but could be<br>&gt; accomplished by manual configuration or by returning the URI of an<br>&gt; Information Resource Directory from the ALTO Discovery Protocol<br>&gt; [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery/">I-D.ietf-alto-server-discovery</a>].<br><br>&nbsp; I wonder if there should be a non-binding recommendation of how<br>&nbsp; this URI should look like.<br><br><br>Section 6.8.1.1.6., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; GET /networkmap HTTP/1.1 Host: <a href="http://alto.example.com">alto.example.com</a> Accept:<br>&gt; application/alto-networkmap+json,application/alto-error+json<br><br>&nbsp; What happens actually if the client does not set<br>&nbsp; 'Accept:application/alto-error+json'?<br><br>&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 370 Content-Type:<br>&gt; application/alto-networkmap+json<br><br><br>Section 6.8.1.2., paragraph 1:<br><br>&gt; The Cost Map resource lists the Path Cost for each pair of source/<br>&gt; destination PID defined by the ALTO Server for a given Cost Type and<br>&gt; Cost Mode.&nbsp; This resource MUST be provided for at least the<br>&gt; 'routingcost' Cost Type and 'numerical' Cost Mode.<br><br>&nbsp; Section 5.1.2. says that numerical or ordinal MUST be supported,<br>&nbsp; but not at the same time.

Is there any good reason to leave this, as it is right<br>&nbsp; now? I would imagine that client is forced to say what AddressType<br>&nbsp; it is interested in.

Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Enrico Marocco is the document shepherd, Martin Stiemerling is the<br>&nbsp; responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has followed the specification process<br>&nbsp; closely, implementing a proof-of-concept client application himself<br>&nbsp; (<a href="http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/">http://alto.tilab.com/alto-xkcd/</a>). He has proofread the final<br>&nbsp; version of the document and believes it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Each and every word has been read by litteraly hundreds of<br>&nbsp; eyes. However, the document shepherd believes that additional<br>&nbsp; external reviews (e.g. apps-dir and/or gen-art) would be beneficial,<br>&nbsp; esp. to spot areas in the document that may turn out unclear to the<br>&nbsp; unexperienced reader.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; The document specifies an HTTP-based application layer protocol,<br>&nbsp; following the best practices generally referenced as REST-ful and<br>&nbsp; requesting the registration of several media types. All these<br>&nbsp; aspects have been approached under the supervision of APPS experts<br>&nbsp; (Peter Saint-Andre, Martin Thomson, Richard Barnes, Alexey<br>&nbsp; Melnikov) and should probably be re-checked for consistency. The<br>&nbsp; document has also received a review from OPS perspective (from<br>&nbsp; Benoit Claise).<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; According to the document shepherd the document is good, all that<br>&nbsp; could be removed has been removed.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; The authors are not aware of any IPR on the document and believe<br>&nbsp; that it is compliant with IETF copyright and IPR policy rules.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR disclosure references this document. Two IPR disclosures<br>&nbsp; (#1628 and #1718) were filed regarding proposed extensions to the<br>&nbsp; protocol, but the WG decided not to integrate them in the base<br>&nbsp; specs.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; Strong consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; IDnits returns a bunch of warnings about missing references, one in<br>&nbsp; an informative "ChangeLog" section whose removal will be discusse<br>&nbsp; with the RFC Editor and the remaining caused by the square brakets<br>&nbsp; used in the JSON code examples.<br><br>&nbsp; IDnits also returns a downref error as it lists JSON specs (<a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 4627</a>) in the normative section. Guidance on this is expected from<br>&nbsp; the IESG, as, despite being an Invormative document, JSON is in fact<br>&nbsp; a standard this protocol as well as most of today's web technologies<br>&nbsp; are based on. To the best of my knowledge APPSAWG is fixing the<br>&nbsp; incosistency, but unfortunately a proper 4627bis is not going to be<br>&nbsp; published in time.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Media types have been nailed down under the supervision of the APPS<br>&nbsp; tech advisor and with the help of APPS experts. See (2) and (5).<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. Please note the expection described in (11) to which the WG<br>&nbsp; defers any decision to the IESG.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; The document build up on JSON specs, de-facto standard despite being<br>&nbsp; defined in an Informational RFC. A fix for such an incostincency is<br>&nbsp; being worked on by APPSAWG. Pragmatically the WG does not see any<br>&nbsp; issue with referencing such a document in the normative section. The<br>&nbsp; process-wise decision is deferred to the IESG.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; Two downrefs, one to IEEE Standard 754, supposedly compliant with <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>&nbsp; 3967</a>, and on to <a href="/doc/rfc4627/">RFC 4627</a> as described in (11) and (14).<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests registration of ten media types and the<br>&nbsp; creation of three registries. All IANA actions have been carefully<br>&nbsp; ponderated, in accordance to guidelines in <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; The document defines three new registries: an ALTO Cost Type<br>&nbsp; Registry, an ALTO Endpoint Property Registry and an ALTO Address<br>&nbsp; Type Registry. This is the minimum set identified in the working<br>&nbsp; group for achieving proper extensibility of the new protocol.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; No automated checks were required other than IDnits.</div></td>
