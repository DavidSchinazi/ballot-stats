Some non-blocking comments:<br><br>1. I have some concerns about the scalability of this proposal and the Log ID registry. If I understand correctly, there are at least two reasons an operator would choose to shut down their log and start a new one, which requires a new log ID: <br><br>- to refresh the signature algorithm and/or key<br><br>- As certificates expire and are renewed over time, the log has to retain an ever-expanding listing of useless, expired certificates and chains. While the Merkle tree makes this computationally inexpensive, pruning the storage requirements would require a refresh.<br><br>Which is to say that log IDs should change quite frequently. I'm not very knowledgeable about the OID hierarchy, but it might be valuable for log IDs to have enough structure for a given provider to be given one tier of log IDs (e.g. 1.3.101.80.x.y, where "x" is assigned to an operator via IANA and "y" is a version number incremented by that operator).<br><br>2. Would it be valuable to have a new "certificate revoked" object type in logs that could provide some assurance that entries hadn't been revoked? I can think of some ways this might work, but am not familiar enough with the use cases to say if it'd be valuable.<br><br>3. One nit: 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 have broken markdown tags.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence<br>&nbsp;  of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are<br>&nbsp;  issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit<br>&nbsp;  certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of<br>&nbsp;  suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs<br>&nbsp;  themselves.&nbsp; The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to<br>&nbsp;  honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing<br>&nbsp;  CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is a bis document for the Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br>&nbsp;  The major changes between that document and this document are<br>&nbsp;  listed in Section 1.3 of the draft, and are:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Hash and signature algorithm agility: permitted algorithms are now<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified in IANA registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Precertificate format: precertificates are now CMS objects rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than X.509 certificates, which avoids violating the certificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; serial number uniqueness requirement in Section 4.1.2.2 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Removed precertificate signing certificates and the precertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poison extension: the change of precertificate format means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these are no longer needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Logs IDs: each log is now identified by an OID rather than by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash of its public key.&nbsp; OID allocations are managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; "TransItem" structure: this new data structure is used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulate most types of CT data.&nbsp; A "TransItemList", consisting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one or more "TransItem" structures, can be used anywhere that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "SignedCertificateTimestampList" was used in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Merkle tree leaves: the "MerkleTreeLeaf" structure has been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaced by the "TransItem" structure, which eases extensibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and simplifies the leaf structure by removing one layer of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; abstraction.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Unified leaf format: the structure for both certificate and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; precertificate entries now includes only the TBSCertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (whereas certificate entries in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] included the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; SCT extensions: these are now typed and managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; STH extensions: STHs can now contain extensions, which are typed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and managed by an IANA registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; API outputs: complete "TransItem" structures are returned, rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than the constituent parts of each structure.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; get-all-by-hash: new client API for obtaining an inclusion proof<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the corresponding consistency proof at the same time.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Presenting SCTs with proofs: TLS servers may present SCTs together<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the corresponding inclusion proofs using any of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mechanisms that [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] defined for presenting SCTs only.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Presenting SCTs only is still supported).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; CT TLS extension: the "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has been replaced by the "transparency_info" TLS extension.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Other TLS extensions: "status_request_v2" may be used (in the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; manner as "status_request"); "cached_info" may be used to avoid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sending the same complete SCTs and inclusion proofs to the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS clients multiple times.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; TLS Feature extension: this certificate extension may be used by a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CA to indicate that CT compliance is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Verification algorithms: added detailed algorithms for verifying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inclusion proofs, for verifying consistency between two STHs, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for verifying a root hash given a complete list of the relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leaf input entries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Extensive clarifications and editorial work.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Clarifications for use with TLS v1.2 and v1.3<br> <br>&nbsp;  Backwards compatibility:<br><br>&nbsp;  Logs can either conform to <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a> (???v1???) or <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>??bis (???v2???),<br>&nbsp;  not both, as the format of the data logged is different. As v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs are delivered using different X.509, TLS and OCSP extensions,<br>&nbsp;  they can mostly co??exist and TLS clients can support both<br>&nbsp;  simultaneously.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence<br>&nbsp;  of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are<br>&nbsp;  issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit<br>&nbsp;  certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of<br>&nbsp;  suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs<br>&nbsp;  themselves.&nbsp; The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to<br>&nbsp;  honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing<br>&nbsp;  CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is a bis document for the Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br>&nbsp;  The major changes between that document and this document are<br>&nbsp;  listed in Section 1.3 of the draft, and are:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Hash and signature algorithm agility: permitted algorithms are now<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified in IANA registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Precertificate format: precertificates are now CMS objects rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than X.509 certificates, which avoids violating the certificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; serial number uniqueness requirement in Section 4.1.2.2 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Removed precertificate signing certificates and the precertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poison extension: the change of precertificate format means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these are no longer needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Logs IDs: each log is now identified by an OID rather than by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash of its public key.&nbsp; OID allocations are managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; "TransItem" structure: this new data structure is used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulate most types of CT data.&nbsp; A "TransItemList", consisting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one or more "TransItem" structures, can be used anywhere that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "SignedCertificateTimestampList" was used in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Merkle tree leaves: the "MerkleTreeLeaf" structure has been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaced by the "TransItem" structure, which eases extensibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and simplifies the leaf structure by removing one layer of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; abstraction.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Unified leaf format: the structure for both certificate and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; precertificate entries now includes only the TBSCertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (whereas certificate entries in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] included the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; SCT extensions: these are now typed and managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; STH extensions: STHs can now contain extensions, which are typed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and managed by an IANA registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; API outputs: complete "TransItem" structures are returned, rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than the constituent parts of each structure.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; get-all-by-hash: new client API for obtaining an inclusion proof<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the corresponding consistency proof at the same time.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Presenting SCTs with proofs: TLS servers may present SCTs together<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the corresponding inclusion proofs using any of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mechanisms that [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] defined for presenting SCTs only.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Presenting SCTs only is still supported).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; CT TLS extension: the "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has been replaced by the "transparency_info" TLS extension.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Other TLS extensions: "status_request_v2" may be used (in the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; manner as "status_request"); "cached_info" may be used to avoid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sending the same complete SCTs and inclusion proofs to the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS clients multiple times.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; TLS Feature extension: this certificate extension may be used by a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CA to indicate that CT compliance is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Verification algorithms: added detailed algorithms for verifying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inclusion proofs, for verifying consistency between two STHs, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for verifying a root hash given a complete list of the relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leaf input entries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Extensive clarifications and editorial work.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Clarifications for use with TLS v1.2 and v1.3<br> <br>&nbsp;  Backwards compatibility:<br><br>&nbsp;  Logs can either conform to <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a> (???v1???) or <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>??bis (???v2???),<br>&nbsp;  not both, as the format of the data logged is different. As v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs are delivered using different X.509, TLS and OCSP extensions,<br>&nbsp;  they can mostly co??exist and TLS clients can support both<br>&nbsp;  simultaneously. One provision has been made for embedded v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs by requiring v2 clients to&nbsp; remove v1 SCTs from the<br>&nbsp;  TBSCertificate portion of the certificate before validating v2 SCTs<br>&nbsp;  over it (to allow v2 SCTs to be embedded before v1 SCTs are issued).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting?

This bis document is therefore intended as<br>&nbsp;  Proposed Standard. <br><br>Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes, the document title page indicates being 'standard track'.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence<br>&nbsp;  of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are<br>&nbsp;  issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit<br>&nbsp;  certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of<br>&nbsp;  suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs<br>&nbsp;  themselves.&nbsp; The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to<br>&nbsp;  honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing<br>&nbsp;  CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is a bis document for the Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br>&nbsp;  The major changes between that document and this document are<br>&nbsp;  listed in Section 1.3 of the draft, and are:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Hash and signature algorithm agility: permitted algorithms are now<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified in IANA registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Precertificate format: precertificates are now CMS objects rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than X.509 certificates, which avoids violating the certificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; serial number uniqueness requirement in Section 4.1.2.2 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Removed precertificate signing certificates and the precertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poison extension: the change of precertificate format means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these are no longer needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Logs IDs: each log is now identified by an OID rather than by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash of its public key.&nbsp; OID allocations are managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; "TransItem" structure: this new data structure is used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulate most types of CT data.&nbsp; A "TransItemList", consisting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one or more "TransItem" structures, can be used anywhere that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "SignedCertificateTimestampList" was used in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Merkle tree leaves: the "MerkleTreeLeaf" structure has been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaced by the "TransItem" structure, which eases extensibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and simplifies the leaf structure by removing one layer of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; abstraction.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Unified leaf format: the structure for both certificate and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; precertificate entries now includes only the TBSCertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (whereas certificate entries in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] included the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; SCT extensions: these are now typed and managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; STH extensions: STHs can now contain extensions, which are typed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and managed by an IANA registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; API outputs: complete "TransItem" structures are returned, rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than the constituent parts of each structure.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; get-all-by-hash: new client API for obtaining an inclusion proof<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the corresponding consistency proof at the same time.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Presenting SCTs with proofs: TLS servers may present SCTs together<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the corresponding inclusion proofs using any of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mechanisms that [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] defined for presenting SCTs only.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Presenting SCTs only is still supported).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; CT TLS extension: the "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has been replaced by the "transparency_info" TLS extension.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Other TLS extensions: "status_request_v2" may be used (in the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; manner as "status_request"); "cached_info" may be used to avoid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sending the same complete SCTs and inclusion proofs to the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS clients multiple times.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; TLS Feature extension: this certificate extension may be used by a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CA to indicate that CT compliance is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Verification algorithms: added detailed algorithms for verifying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inclusion proofs, for verifying consistency between two STHs, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for verifying a root hash given a complete list of the relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leaf input entries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Extensive clarifications and editorial work.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Clarifications for use with TLS v1.2 and v1.3<br> <br>&nbsp;  Backwards compatibility:<br><br>&nbsp;  Logs can either conform to <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a> (???v1???) or <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>??bis (???v2???),<br>&nbsp;  not both, as the format of the data logged is different. As v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs are delivered using different X.509, TLS and OCSP extensions,<br>&nbsp;  they can mostly co??exist and TLS clients can support both<br>&nbsp;  simultaneously. One provision has been made for embedded v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs by requiring v2 clients to&nbsp; remove v1 SCTs from the<br>&nbsp;  TBSCertificate portion of the certificate before validating v2 SCTs<br>&nbsp;  over it (to allow v2 SCTs to be embedded before v1 SCTs are issued).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  During the document development, some content was split of<br>&nbsp;  into other documents for clarity. Topics split of covers a threat<br>&nbsp;  model document, a log monitoring API, and a client/gossip API.<br><br>&nbsp;  Name redaction has been considered and was split of in another<br>&nbsp;  document as well. The WG is still discussing whether or not to<br>&nbsp;  allow name redaction as well as the redaction method that would<br>&nbsp;  be used.<br><br>&nbsp;  Currently, there is still an open issue between some major vendors<br>&nbsp;  about whether this document is good enough as a basis to develop<br>&nbsp;  further preventative client actions on. The WG Chairs are organising<br>&nbsp;  a meeting with these parties to determine if the document should be<br>&nbsp;  stalled or proceed.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol?<br><br>&nbsp;  There are various implementations in different state of completion<br>&nbsp;  which have lead to updates to the document.<br><br>&nbsp;  Various well-known crypto libraries have started implementation.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement<br>the specification?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes. Various well-known crypto libraries have started implementation.<br>&nbsp;  A few new independent parties have also implemented or mostly<br>&nbsp;  implemented this document's specification - both proprietary as well<br>&nbsp;  as opensource implementations.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done<br>a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? <br><br>&nbsp;  Stephen Kent gave many in-depth reviews of many versions of the<br>&nbsp;  document, all of which were dealt with by the Working Group. Daniel<br>&nbsp;  Kahn Gillmor came up with a new attack, which is now described in one<br>&nbsp;  of the documents that was split off from this one. During WGLC several<br>&nbsp;  implementers came forward explaining that one MUST keyword (in Section<br>&nbsp;  5.1) had to change to SHOULD to allow for log behaviour that was deemed<br>&nbsp;  necessary for actual deployments, which was agreed on by the Working<br>&nbsp;  Group.<br><br>If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  There was no such review.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br><br>&nbsp;  Paul Wouters<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Roman Danyliw&nbsp; (Eric Rescorla before him, as this document has taken a long time)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  I read all the threads about this document on the mailing list to be<br>&nbsp;  sure that the issues raised were address or at least discussed in the WG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. The document has been seen and is (being) implemented widely in<br>&nbsp;  various different parts of the industry and opensource communities.<br>&nbsp;  There is significant interest and traction to roll-out implementations<br>&nbsp;  of this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No. The important groups that needed to read and comment on this<br>&nbsp;  document were the PKIX and TLS communities and these groups were<br>&nbsp;  very well represented.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No concerns other than taking more time to publish.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  [PAUL: Do I need to click on the IPR button in the datatracker before<br>&nbsp;  submitting this? ]<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  Not that the WG chairs are aware of.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp;  It represents strong consensus within the WG, which includes many<br>&nbsp;  relevant affected players in the industry (CA vendors, browser<br>&nbsp;  vendors, TLS implementors, crypto library authors). The only item<br>&nbsp;  which did not have strong consensus was name redaction, which has<br>&nbsp;  therefore been moved to its own document for possible future work.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Appeals were threatened in the past, but have been resolved.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The idnits tool shows a few warnings:<br><br>&nbsp; == There are 7 instances of lines with non-RFC6890-compliant IPv4 addresses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in the document.&nbsp; If these are example addresses, they should be changed.<br><br>These are false positives (I think it is reading OID's as IPv6?)<br><br><br>&nbsp; ** Obsolete normative reference: <a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC 5246</a> (Obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>)<br><br>That is correct. That is TLS v1.2 and the document specifically talks about TLS v1.2 and v1.3<br><br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br><br>&nbsp;  There is one. <a href="/doc/rfc6979/">RFC 6979</a> "Deterministic Usage of the Digital Signature<br>&nbsp;  Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.

I would really like to see some recommendations on point 5 before this document moves on!<br><br> 1) I found section 2 a bit hard to follow. Would it maybe be possible to provide more textual explanation of the algorithms instead of just describing the steps of the algorithms? Also I was wondering how much much these algorithms are actually „part“ of the protocol spec…? Are could these be rather seen as example algorithms? Maybe that could be further clarified<br><br> 2) Please expand STH on first occurrence (in sec 4.1)<br><br> 3) Sec 4.4: „A log's operator MUST either allocate the OID<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; themselves or request an OID from the Log ID Registry (see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 10.6.1).“<br>Isn't there an obligation to register?<br><br> 4) sec 4.8: „If an<br>&nbsp;  implementation sees an extension that it does not understand, it<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD ignore that extension.“<br>Maybe it’s just me because I may have missed some context but does „ignore“ mean here that it should log it or not?<br><br> 5) sec 5: „MAY retry the same<br>&nbsp;  request without modification at a later date.“<br>Would it be possible to provide a recommendation how long the client should wait?<br> <br> 6) sec 5.6: „Logs MAY restrict the number of entries that can be retrieved per<br>&nbsp;  "get-entries" request.“<br>Should this be added to sec 4.1?<br><br> 7) sec 10.3: Couldn’t you use the TLS&nbsp; SignatureScheme Registry directly (instead of forming an own registry)?<br><br> 8) sec 10.4: i Wonder if an RFC-required policy wouldn’t be more appropriate for the VersionedTransTypes registry?<br><br> 9) sec 10.6.1:I guess&nbsp; the registration policy is FCFS? <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a> recommend to always (clearly) name the registry.<br><br>And finally one higher level question mainly out of curiosity: was it considered to e.g. use json for all data structures? Is there a performance reason to not do that or wasn’t that even discussed?</div></td>

 in size (1 byte) and value, so the DER encoding of the OID can be<br>&nbsp;  reproduced simply by prepending an OBJECT IDENTIFIER tag (0x06) to<br>&nbsp;  the opaque vector length and contents.<br><br>nit: maybe "full DER encoding (including tag and length)" to contrast<br>with the previous paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;  OIDs used to identify logs are limited such that the DER encoding of<br>&nbsp;  their value is less than or equal to 127 octets.<br><br>This seems to be a new requirement to this spec, in which case <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a><br>language would be appropriate?<br><br>Section 4.7<br><br>&nbsp;  "sct_extensions" matches the SCT extensions of the corresponding SCT.<br><br>Is this supposed to imply the ordering and non-duplication requirements?<br>(If it does not, then recreating the log entry from the SCT for<br>signature validation could prove difficult.)<br><br>Sections 4.9, 4.10<br><br>Do we really want to allow for zero-length signatures in the structure<br>definition?<br><br>Section 4.11<br><br>&nbsp;  "consistency_path" is a vector of Merkle Tree nodes proving the<br>&nbsp;  consistency of two STHs.<br><br>A backreference to Section 2.1.4 might be helpful.<br><br>Section 4.12<br><br>&nbsp;  "inclusion_path" is a vector of Merkle Tree nodes proving the<br>&nbsp;

4648 is fairly clear that the<br>default is to include the padding characters, so there isn't necessarily<br>any change needed here.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; chain:&nbsp; An array of zero or more base64 encoded CA certificates.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first element is the certifier of the "submission"; the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  second certifies the first; etc.&nbsp; The last element of "chain"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (or, if "chain" is an empty array, the "submission") is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  certified by an accepted trust anchor.<br><br>I'm reading this to be a JSON array of strings; is that correct, and do<br>we want to be more explicit about it ("no" may well be fine)?<br><br>&nbsp;  If "submission" is an accepted trust anchor whose certifier is<br>&nbsp;  neither an accepted trust anchor nor the first element of "chain",<br>&nbsp;  then the log MUST return the "unknown anchor" error.&nbsp; A log cannot<br>&nbsp;  generate an SCT for a submission if it does not have access to the<br>&nbsp;  issuer's public key.<br><br>Is this a descriptive "cannot" or a normative "MUST NOT"?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the returned "sct" is intended to be provided to TLS clients, then<br>&nbsp;  "sth" and "inclusion" (if returned) SHOULD also be provided to TLS<br>&nbsp;  clients (e.g., if "type" was 2 (for "precert_sct_v2") then all three<br>&nbsp;  "TransItem"s could be embedded in the certificate).<br><br>nit: the grammar is a bit weird around the second "then", maybe ", so<br>that" is easier to read?<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>IMPORTANT: The input to get-proof-by-hash has a "tree_size" but the<br>processing discussion refers to a single "requested STH".&nbsp; It does not<br>seem like the one uniquely determines the other, since there could be<br>multiple valid STHs for a given tree size (e.g., if there are no<br>submissions for more than the MMD).&nbsp; Is the intent to supply an STH as<br>input, or is there otherwise need for further clarity here?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inclusion:&nbsp; A base64 encoded "TransItem" of type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "inclusion_proof_v2" whose "inclusion_path" array of Merkle<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tree nodes proves the inclusion of the chosen certificate in<br>&nbsp;

Perhaps it's worth making a note of that.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  CT-using TLS servers MUST use at least one of the three mechanisms<br>&nbsp;  listed below to present one or more SCTs from one or more logs to<br>&nbsp;  each TLS client during full TLS handshakes, where each SCT<br><br>This MUST may need some caveats, given that the server can't use TLS<br>extensions not offered first by the client.&nbsp; So maybe it has to be<br>"each CT-using TLS client".<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; One or more logs may not have become acceptable to all CT-using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS clients.<br><br>nit: are we concerned about (new?) logs potentially becoming acceptable<br>to clients, or logs acceptable to clients becoming no longer accepted<br>(or both)?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  In each "TransItemList" that is sent to a client during a TLS<br><br>nit: I don't know that "to a client" is needed; the server can just as<br>well use CT for client certificates, right?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The TLS server MUST construct a "TransItemList" of relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "TransItem"s (see Section 6.3), which SHOULD omit any "TransItem"s<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that are already embedded in the server certificate or the stapled<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OCSP response (see Section 7.1).&nbsp; If the constructed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "TransItemList" is not empty, then the TLS server MUST include the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "transparency_info" extension with the "extension_data" set to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this "TransItemList".<br><br>Am I allowed to send an empty "transparency_info" extension if the<br>TransItemList is empty?<br><br>&nbsp;  TLS servers MUST only include this extension in the following<br>&nbsp;  messages:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; the ServerHello message (for TLS 1.2 or earlier).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; the Certificate or CertificateRequest message (for TLS 1.3).<br><br>Servers sending it in CR implies that clients can send it in Certificate<br>(heh, the normal "CT" abbreviation is not really usable in this<br>context), but we don't explicitly say that.<br><br>Section 10.3<br><br>I'm confused by this registry.&nbsp; Is the SignatureScheme value required to<br>come from/match the TLS SignatureScheme registry?&nbsp; Is anything going to<br>key off that value or otherwise use the value in a protocol data<br>structure?&nbsp; (Why are there two entries for 0x0403?)<br><br>Section 10.5<br><br>&nbsp;  All OIDs in the range from 1.3.101.8192 to 1.3.101.16383 have been<br>&nbsp;  reserved.&nbsp; This is a limited resource of 8,192 OIDs, each of which<br>&nbsp;  has an encoded length of 4 octets.<br><br>The table says "Unassigned"; which is it?<br><br>Section 11.1<br><br>This seems to be making some unstated assumptions, including perhaps<br>that someone has actually submitted the misissued certificate in<br>question to a log (in order to support the claim that the maximum time<br>it can be used without audit is twice the MMD).<br><br>Section 11.3<br><br>We may want to note the potential privacy concerns relating to gossip<br>and similar mechanisms, at least in passing.&nbsp; I do see Section 11.4,<br>though there's not a terribly tight linkage in the text, and 11.4 may<br>not have comprehensive coverage of all privacy considerations.<br><br>Section 13.2<br><br>I think that RFCs 6234 and 6979 may need to be normative, since they're<br>needed for the signature/hash algorithms that are specified for use.</div></td>

This bis document is therefore intended as<br>&nbsp;  Proposed Standard. <br><br>Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes, the document title page indicates being 'standard track'.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence<br>&nbsp;  of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are<br>&nbsp;  issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit<br>&nbsp;  certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of<br>&nbsp;  suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs<br>&nbsp;  themselves.&nbsp; The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to<br>&nbsp;  honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing<br>&nbsp;  CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is a bis document for the Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br>&nbsp;  The major changes between that document and this document are<br>&nbsp;  listed in Section 1.3 of the draft, and are:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Hash and signature algorithm agility: permitted algorithms are now<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified in IANA registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Precertificate format: precertificates are now CMS objects rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than X.509 certificates, which avoids violating the certificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; serial number uniqueness requirement in Section 4.1.2.2 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Removed precertificate signing certificates and the precertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poison extension: the change of precertificate format means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these are no longer needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Logs IDs: each log is now identified by an OID rather than by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash of its public key.&nbsp; OID allocations are managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; "TransItem" structure: this new data structure is used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulate most types of CT data.&nbsp; A "TransItemList", consisting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one or more "TransItem" structures, can be used anywhere that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "SignedCertificateTimestampList" was used in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Merkle tree leaves: the "MerkleTreeLeaf" structure has been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaced by the "TransItem" structure, which eases extensibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and simplifies the leaf structure by removing one layer of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; abstraction.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Unified leaf format: the structure for both certificate and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; precertificate entries now includes only the TBSCertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (whereas certificate entries in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] included the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; SCT extensions: these are now typed and managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; STH extensions: STHs can now contain extensions, which are typed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and managed by an IANA registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; API outputs: complete "TransItem" structures are returned, rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than the constituent parts of each structure.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; get-all-by-hash: new client API for obtaining an inclusion proof<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the corresponding consistency proof at the same time.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Presenting SCTs with proofs: TLS servers may present SCTs together<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with the corresponding inclusion proofs using any of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mechanisms that [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>] defined for presenting SCTs only.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Presenting SCTs only is still supported).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; CT TLS extension: the "signed_certificate_timestamp" TLS extension<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has been replaced by the "transparency_info" TLS extension.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Other TLS extensions: "status_request_v2" may be used (in the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; manner as "status_request"); "cached_info" may be used to avoid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sending the same complete SCTs and inclusion proofs to the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS clients multiple times.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; TLS Feature extension: this certificate extension may be used by a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CA to indicate that CT compliance is required.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Verification algorithms: added detailed algorithms for verifying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inclusion proofs, for verifying consistency between two STHs, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for verifying a root hash given a complete list of the relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; leaf input entries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Extensive clarifications and editorial work.<br> <br>&nbsp;  Backwards compatibility:<br><br>&nbsp;  Logs can either conform to <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a> (???v1???) or <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>??bis (???v2???),<br>&nbsp;  not both, as the format of the data logged is different. As v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs are delivered using different X.509, TLS and OCSP extensions,<br>&nbsp;  they can mostly co??exist and TLS clients can support both<br>&nbsp;  simultaneously. One provision has been made for embedded v1 and<br>&nbsp;  v2 SCTs by requiring v2 clients to&nbsp; remove v1 SCTs from the<br>&nbsp;  TBSCertificate portion of the certificate before validating v2 SCTs<br>&nbsp;  over it (to allow v2 SCTs to be embedded before v1 SCTs are issued).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a protocol for publicly logging the existence<br>&nbsp;  of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are<br>&nbsp;  issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit<br>&nbsp;  certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of<br>&nbsp;  suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs<br>&nbsp;  themselves.&nbsp; The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to<br>&nbsp;  honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing<br>&nbsp;  CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is a bis document for the Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br>&nbsp;  The major changes between that document and this document are<br>&nbsp;  listed in Section 1.3 of the draft, and are:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Hash and signature algorithm agility: permitted algorithms are now<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified in IANA registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Precertificate format: precertificates are now CMS objects rather<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than X.509 certificates, which avoids violating the certificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; serial number uniqueness requirement in Section 4.1.2.2 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Removed precertificate signing certificates and the precertificate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poison extension: the change of precertificate format means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these are no longer needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Logs IDs: each log is now identified by an OID rather than by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hash of its public key.&nbsp; OID allocations are managed by an IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registry.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; "TransItem" structure: this new data structure is used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulate most types of CT data.&nbsp; A "TransItemList", consisting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of one or more "TransItem" structures, can be used anywhere that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "SignedCertificateTimestampList" was used in [<a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Merkle tree leaves: the "MerkleTreeLeaf" structure has been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaced by the "TransItem" structure, which eases extensibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and simplifies the leaf structure by removing one layer of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; abstraction.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp;

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp;  It represents strong consensus within the WG, which includes many<br>&nbsp;  relevant affected players in the industry (CA vendors, browser<br>&nbsp;  vendors, TLS implementors, crypto library authors). The only item<br>&nbsp;  which did not have strong consensus was name redaction, which has<br>&nbsp;  therefore been moved to its own document for possible WG adoption.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Appeals were threatened in the past, but have been resolved.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The idnits tool shows a few warnings:<br><br>&nbsp; == There are 7 instances of lines with non-RFC6890-compliant IPv4 addresses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in the document.&nbsp; If these are example addresses, they should be changed.<br><br>These are false positives <br><br>&nbsp; -- The draft header indicates that this document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC6962</a>, but the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  abstract doesn't seem to mention this, which it should.<br><br>It does mention this is "version 2.0 of CT", but I will request the authors<br>to more explicitely mention this in the abstract.<br><br>&nbsp; == The copyright year in the IETF Trust and authors Copyright Line does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  match the current year<br><br>&nbsp; -- The document date (December 29, 2016) is 31 days in the past.&nbsp; Is this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  intentional?<br><br>Artifact of year rollover.<br><br>&nbsp; -- Looks like a reference, but probably isn't: '1' on line 363<br><br>&nbsp; -- Looks like a reference, but probably isn't: '7' on line 498<br><br>&nbsp; -- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br><br>&nbsp;  There is one. <a href="/doc/rfc6979/">RFC 6979</a> "Deterministic Usage of the Digital Signature<br>&nbsp;  Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)"<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes. It obsoleted <a href="/doc/rfc6962/">RFC 6962</a>.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  It has been reviews and complies with the requirements of RFC-5226<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  The following new registries are requested to be created:<br><br>&nbsp; Section&nbsp; Registry Name<br><br>&nbsp; 10.3&nbsp; &nbsp;  CT Hash Algorithms<br>&nbsp; 10.4&nbsp; &nbsp;  CT Signature Algorithms<br>&nbsp; 10.5&nbsp; &nbsp;  CT VersionedTransTypes<br>&nbsp; 10.6&nbsp; &nbsp;  CT Extension Types for SCT<br>&nbsp; 10.7&nbsp; &nbsp;  CT Extension Types for STH<br>&nbsp; 10.8.1&nbsp;  CT Log ID Registry"<br><br>All of these Registries are defined to require Expert Review.
