I<br>only noted the more eggregious nits that have obvious fixes but skipped<br>the ones where I did not have a resolution ready at hand to suggest.<br>Barry's remarks about restrictive vs non-restrictive clauses are<br>particularly important.<br><br>I also have several high-level issues that don't quite rise to<br>discuss-level but seem worth getting resolution on; they mostly involve<br>edge cases where the current text either leaves me unclear on what is<br>supposed to happen or seems to present conflicting guidance:<br><br>- what's the error handling in cases of partial success?<br>&nbsp; * For operations adding/removing sessions to/from groups, it seems that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the general principle is that the new changes introduced with any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group-relevant CCF exchange are to be treated atomically: either all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group additions/removals succeed or all fail (and when it fails the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; session is forced into a single-session fallback mode).&nbsp; But for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; server-initiated modifications this is enforced by "if the client<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; can't do it, the client MUST tear down the affected session(s)", and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not sure if there's a case where the client can send a new<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; request that includes some modifications and the server also tries<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to make some modifications in its response; such a scenario might in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; effect allow partial success and might also be hard to correctly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; interpret.<br>&nbsp; * For operations acting on groups, we do allow partial success<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS) and attempt to mandate fallback to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; single-session operation for affected sessions, but the specifics of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; how the Failed-AVP effectuates this are not clear to me (see my<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; comment on Section 4.4.3).<br><br>- we require that group identifiers are globally unique, which can be<br>&nbsp; done with the diameter-node namespace prefix.&nbsp; But for the portion<br>&nbsp; after that prefix, we seem to suggest reusing the construction from<br>&nbsp; Section 8.8 of <a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC 6733</a>, which is just (in essence) a 64-bit global<br>&nbsp; counter.&nbsp; In the vein of <a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a>,<br>&nbsp; that seems overly constrained, in that it reveals sequencing across<br>&nbsp; group creation and rate of per-node group creation to the remote peer.<br>&nbsp; It seems that a construction akin to a keyed hash of a counter would<br>&nbsp; preserve the guaranteed uniqueness property but avoid leaking such<br>&nbsp; information to the network.<br><br>- the permissions model is a bit unorthodox, with groups "owned" by<br>&nbsp; their creator but the binding of a session to a group "owned" by the<br>&nbsp; node that performed the binding.&nbsp; It seems like there is some risk of<br>&nbsp; deadlock situations or conflict, e.g., where a client has added a<br>&nbsp; session to a group G but the server wants to remove the session from<br>&nbsp; G, or where a session is part of a group but the owner of the group<br>&nbsp; wants to delete the group.&nbsp; For the latter case, my understanding is<br>&nbsp; that group deletion "trumps" ownership of the session/group binding,<br>&nbsp; such that deletion can proceed even while sessions are in the group,<br>&nbsp; but I'm less sure what should happen in the former case (or others).<br><br>- Is it possible to have a group with no member sessions?&nbsp; Section 3.3<br>&nbsp; suggests that if the last session is removed the group should be<br>&nbsp; deleted, but AFAICT this would still require the node performing the<br>&nbsp; removal to unset SESSION_GROUP_STATUS_IND, and I didn't see a<br>&nbsp; requirement to do that spelled out.&nbsp; I do see how it is impossible to<br>&nbsp; create a group directly in a state with no member sessions.<br><br>- Is there a requirement to always send the current state of group<br>&nbsp; membership when acting on a session?&nbsp; I could (perhaps naively)<br>&nbsp; imagine a case where due to previous interactions a session belongs to<br>&nbsp; groups G1, G2, and G3, but in some subsequent request the client only<br>&nbsp; mentions G1.&nbsp; Does the membership in G2 and G3 get implicitly retained<br>&nbsp; in the absence of an explicit unset SESSION_GROUP_ALLOCATION_ACTION or<br>&nbsp; are there some other constraints that make such a scenario impossible?<br><br>- Is there supposed to be a strong distinction between "including" an<br>&nbsp; AVP and "appending" one?&nbsp; I see that 6733 does make some fairly clear<br>&nbsp; distinction between the terms, but it seems that (e.g.) in Section<br>&nbsp; 4.2.1 we use both phrasings to discuss Session-Group-Info.<br><br>Now for some section-by-section (mostly editorial or nit-level) notes.<br><br>Abstract, Introduction<br><br>&nbsp;  a million concurrent Diameter sessions.&nbsp; Recent use cases have<br>&nbsp;  revealed the need for Diameter nodes to apply the same operation to a<br>&nbsp;  large group of Diameter sessions concurrently.&nbsp; The Diameter base<br><br>I note that the -00 is from 2012; are these use cases still "recent"?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>As an editorial note, the way the current text jumps in to say that<br>sessions can be assigned to groups leaves the reader uncertain whether<br>this is describing preexisting functionality or the new mechanisms added<br>by this document.&nbsp; A top-level intro paragraph for Section 3 that says<br>roughly "to accomodate bulk operations on Diameter sessions, the concept<br>of session groups is introduced; once sessions are added to a group, a<br>command acting on the group will affect all the member sessions" might<br>help.<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>If I understand correctly, the lines in the table for "remove a session<br>from an owned Session Group"/"remove a session from a non-owned Session<br>Group" mean only that this operation can be done sometimes, not that it<br>can always be done (per the lines about "created the assignment".&nbsp; Would<br>it be helpful to indicate this, perhaps by using a different symbol for<br>those lines and adding a footnote?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>While I understand the desire to keep the document structure as it is,<br>with the actual AVPs specified in Section 7, it would have been very<br>helpful to have a toplevel introductory paragraph here that mentions or<br>references that there is a containing Session-Group-Info grouped AVP<br>that contains the Session-Group-Control-Vector with information about<br>the action and group, and zero or one(?) Session-Group-Id AVP to<br>identify the group when a specific group is being identified.&nbsp; This<br>would also allow clarifying whether the Session-Group-Id AVP is<br>currently only defined to appear within the Session-Group-Info.<br><br>Section 4.1.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Such applications provide<br>&nbsp;  intrinsic discovery for the support of session grouping capability<br>&nbsp;  using the assigned Application Id advertised during the capability<br>&nbsp;  exchange phase two Diameter peers establish a transport connection<br>&nbsp;  (see Section 5.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC6733</a>]).<br><br>nit: I think there's a missing word here, perhaps "where" after "phase"?<br><br>Section 4.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The client may also indicate in the request that the server is<br>&nbsp;  responsible for the assignment of the session in one or multiple<br>&nbsp;  sessions owned by the server.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit(?): is this supposed to be "assignment of the session into one or<br>multiple session *groups* owned by the server"?&nbsp; I'm having a hard time<br>understanding it as written.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the assignment of the session to one or some of the multiple<br>&nbsp;  identified session groups fails, the session group assignment is<br>&nbsp;  treated as failure.&nbsp; In such case the session is treated as single<br>&nbsp;  session without assignment to any session group by the Diameter<br>&nbsp;  nodes.&nbsp; The server sends the response to the client and MAY include<br>&nbsp;  those Session-Group-Info AVPs for which the group assignment failed.<br>&nbsp;  The SESSION_GROUP_ALLOCATION_ACTION flag of included Session-Group-<br>&nbsp;  Info AVPs MUST be cleared.<br><br>I guess I understand the part where the entire set of group-assignment<br>operations has to succeed or fail as an atomic unit, but this text<br>perhaps implies some semantics that the server is supposed to only<br>explicitly include in the response the subset of group assignments that<br>were unable to be processed, omitting the ones that could have been<br>processed (but were not processed since a failure on one means that none<br>of the operations get applied).&nbsp; If that's the intent, I'd suggest being<br>a bit more explicit about what is and isn't sent.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Diameter client, which sent a request for session initiation to a<br>&nbsp;  Diameter server and appended a single or multiple Session-Group-Id<br>&nbsp;  AVPs but cannot find any Session-Group-Info AVP in the associated<br><br>(editorial) the phrase "cannot find" makes me wonder how hard it's<br>expected to be looking; more definitive statements about "not present"<br>seem more typical for RFC style.<br><br>Section 4.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  When a Diameter server enforces an update to the assigned groups mid-<br><br>nit: this seems to be the only time we use the word "enforce" in this<br>sense in the document; previous discussion seems to just use "decides to<br>make an update" or similar.<br><br>&nbsp;  answer.&nbsp; The client subsequently sends a service-specific re-<br>&nbsp;  authorization request containing one or multiple Session-Group-Info<br>&nbsp;  AVPs with the SESSION_GROUP_ALLOCATION_ACTION flag set and the<br>&nbsp;  Session-Group-Id AVP identifying the session group to which the<br>&nbsp;  session had been previously assigned.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: I think this has to be "group or groups" to be consistent with the<br>rest of the doc.<br><br>Section 4.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Either Diameter node (client or server) can request the recipient of<br>&nbsp;  a request to process an associated command for all sessions assigned<br>&nbsp;  to one or multiple groups by identifying these groups in the request.<br>&nbsp;  The sender of the request appends for each group, to which the<br>&nbsp;  command applies, a Session-Group-Info AVP including the Session-<br>&nbsp;  Group-Id AVP to identify the associated session group.&nbsp; Both, the<br>&nbsp;  SESSION_GROUP_ALLOCATION_ACTION flag as well as the<br>&nbsp;  SESSION_GROUP_STATUS_IND flag MUST be set.<br><br>What's the error handling if one or both listed flags are not set --<br>just ignore the request?<br><br>&nbsp;  Action AVP to ALL_GROUPS (1) or PER_GROUP (2).&nbsp; If the answer can be<br>&nbsp;  sent before the complete process of the request for all the sessions<br>&nbsp;  or if the request timeout timer is high enough, the sender MAY set<br>&nbsp;  the Group-Response-Action AVP to ALL_GROUPS (1) or PER_GROUP (2).<br><br>(side note) just the phrase "high enough" doesn't give much of an<br>indication of what the criteria are and what numerical values might be<br>appropriate.&nbsp; That said, it's not entirely clear how much guidance we<br>can really give in this situation.<br><br>Section 4.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the received request identifies multiple groups in multiple<br>&nbsp;  appended Session-Group-Id AVPs, the receiver SHOULD process the<br>&nbsp;  associated command for each of these groups.&nbsp; If a session has been<br>&nbsp;  assigned to more than one of the identified groups, the receiver MUST<br>&nbsp;  process the associated command only once per session.<br><br>Why is this only a SHOULD for each group -- what other behaviors could<br>the receiver do?<br><br>Section 4.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  In the case of limited success, the sessions, for which the<br>&nbsp;  processing of the group command failed, MUST be identified using a<br>&nbsp;  Failed-AVP AVP as per Section 7.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC6733</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>My reading of the referenced part of <a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC 6733</a> is that there is a single<br>Failed-AVP pointing to a single AVP that could not be processed<br>properly.&nbsp;

I don’t think so, but what about the next one?&nbsp; Wait, maybe it was the other one after all.”&nbsp; I just have to assume that someon actually implementing Diameter would have an easier time following it.<br><br>I have some editorial comments that won’t help with that aspect, but that I hope will help with clarity in general:<br><br>— Section 3.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  A session group, which has sessions assigned, can be deleted, e.g.,<br>&nbsp;  due to a change in multiple users' subscription profile so that the<br>&nbsp;  group's assigned sessions do not share certain characteristics<br><br>It appears that “has sessions assigned” is restrictive (it’s a required description, not just extra information).&nbsp; If so, it should say, “A session group that has sessions assigned can be deleted, e.g., due to...” without the internal commas.<br><br>Another way to put it might be, “A session group can be deleted even if it has sessions assigned, e.g., due to...”<br><br>— Section 3.3 —<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification follows the most flexible model where both, a<br>&nbsp;  Diameter client and a Diameter server can create a new group and<br><br>Nit: no comma here<br><br>&nbsp;  Either the client and the server<br>&nbsp;  can assign a session to a group.<br><br>Nit: “Either the client or the server can”, or “Both the client and the server can”.<br><br>&nbsp;  Details about<br>&nbsp;  enforcing a more constraint permission model<br><br>I think the word you want is “constrained”.<br><br>— Section 4.2 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Diameter AAA<br>&nbsp;  applications typically assign client and server roles to the Diameter<br>&nbsp;  nodes, which are referred to as relevant Diameter nodes to utilize<br>&nbsp;  session grouping and issue group commands.<br><br>I’m having trouble parsing this sentence and determining what you’re trying to tell me.&nbsp; Can you please rephrase or repunctuate it to make it clearer?&nbsp; What are referred to as “relevant Diameter nodes”?&nbsp; What goes with “to utilize session grouping”?<br><br>&nbsp;  Diameter nodes, which are group-aware, MUST store and maintain an<br>&nbsp;  entry about the group assignment together with a session's state.<br><br>Similar to earlier: is “are group aware” meant to be restrictive (there are Diameter nodes that are group aware and those that are not, and you’re talking about the former), or non-restrictive (all Diameter nodes are group aware, and you’re just pointing that fact out).&nbsp; It is currently written as non-restrictive, but I think you mean it to be restrictive.&nbsp; If that is correct, remove both commas and change “which” to “that”.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Diameter node MUST also keep a record about sessions, which<br>&nbsp;  have been assigned to a session group by itself.<br><br>The comma shouldn’t be there, and “which” should be “that”.&nbsp; But it’s a bit awkward anyway: may I suggest rephrasing in active voice as, “Each Diameter node MUST also keep a record about sessions that it has assigned to a session group.”<br><br>— Section 4.2.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  If the<br>&nbsp;  response from the server indicates success in the result code but<br>&nbsp;  solely the assignment of the session to a session group has been<br>&nbsp;  rejected by the server, the client treats the session as single<br>&nbsp;  session without group assignment.<br><br>What does “solely” mean in this sentence?<br><br>&nbsp;  A Diameter client, which sent a request for session initiation<br><br>Please remove the comma (and change “which” to “that”).<br><br>— Section 4.2.2 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The session, which is to be removed from a group, is<br><br>Make it, “The session that is to be removed from the group is”<br><br>&nbsp;  When a Diameter client decides to remove a session from all session<br>&nbsp;  groups, to which the session has been previously assigned,<br><br>Remove the comma after “groups”.<br><br>&nbsp;  The session, which is to be removed from all groups, to<br>&nbsp;  which the session has been previously assigned, is identified in the<br>&nbsp;  Session-Id AVP of the command request.<br><br>Make it, “The session that is to be removed from all groups to which it had been previously assigned is identified in the Session-Id AVP of the command request.”<br><br>— Section 7.3 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; portion of the Session-Group-Id MUST identify the<br>&nbsp;  Diameter node, which owns the session group.<br><br>Please remove the comma and change “which” to “that”.</div></td>

I have a few substantive comments and a number of editorial comments that need to be resolved first.<br>----------<br><br>*** Substantive Comments ***<br>- General: There were comments in the shepherd’s report that need to be addressed.<br><br>§4.1: Why is the SHOULD not a MUST? What would be the consequences of not following it?<br><br>§4.1.2, last paragraph: How long should a node remember that another node has announced support for groups? Is that memory forever? What happens if that node ceases to support groups in the future?<br><br>§4.2: <br><br>- "A Diameter node MUST also keep a record about sessions,<br>which have been assigned to a session group by itself.”<br><br>Is this the same as saying a node MUST record the owner of each group? Why does it matter which node assigned a specific session to a group?<br><br>§4.2 and children:<br><br>I’d like to see more text about what combinations are allowed and there order of application. For example, if the presence of a Session-Group-Info AVP with the SESSION_GROUP_ALLOCATION_ACTION flag cleared and Session-Group-Id AVP absent indicates deletion of a session from all groups, what if the message also contains other Session-Group-Info AVPs that assign groups? Is that the same thing as moving a session between groups?<br><br>I’d also like to see some earlier text describing the meaning of Session-Id AVPs in group management and group operations. There’s a mention of that in the “format” section, but that seems an odd place to put it.<br><br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>- General: Am I correct to assume that failure of a Diameter command means no groups are assigned? If so, please state that explicitly.<br><br>- first paragraph: The “MUST” seems like a statement of fact. That is, there’s no implementation choice to make here.<br><br>- "If the Diameter server accepts the client’s request for a group<br>assignment, but the assignment of the session to one or some of the<br>multiple identified session groups fails,”<br><br>This seems self contradictory; if the assignment fails then how can the server have accepted it? Is there a practical difference between assignment failure and assignment rejection?<br><br>- "If the Diameter server receives a command request from a Diameter<br>client and the command comprises one or multiple Session-Group-Info<br>AVPs and none of them includes a Session-Group-Id AVP, the server MAY<br>decide to assign the session to one or multiple session groups.”<br><br>Is there an expectation that the server assigns the session to the same number of groups as the the number of Session-Group-Id AVPs included by the client? If not, why would the client ever include more than one.<br><br>Is the client prohibited from sending multiple AVPs, some of which contain session IDs and some of which do not?<br><br>- "the Diameter client SHOULD NOT retry to request<br>group assignment for this session, but MAY try to request group<br>assignment for other new sessions.”<br><br>Why is the SHOULD NOT not a MUST NOT?<br><br>§4.2.3:<br>- "When a Diameter server enforces an update to the assigned groups midsession,<br>it sends a Re-Authorization Request (RAR) message to the<br>client identifying the session…”<br><br>Should that say “or service-specific request”? Or is this operation limited to applications that use RAR?<br><br>§4.4.1:<br><br>- "If the process of the request<br>is delay-sensitive, the sender SHOULD NOT set the Group-Response-<br>Action AVP to ALL_GROUPS (1) or PER_GROUP (2).”<br><br>Why not MUST NOT?<br><br>- "If the answer can be<br>sent before the complete process of the request for all the sessions<br>or if the request timeout timer is high enough, the sender MAY set<br>the Group-Response-Action AVP to ALL_GROUPS (1) or PER_GROUP (2).”<br><br>Can you offer guidance on how to decide if a timeout timer is high enough?<br><br>§5: <br><br>- It’s worth mentioning that a stateful proxy must advertise support.<br><br>- "Session group related AVPs being defined as optional AVP<br>SHOULD be ignored by stateless Proxy Agents and SHOULD NOT be removed<br>from the Diameter commands.”<br><br>This seems to put normative requirements on nodes that do not implement this spec. Or is it really a statement of fact?<br><br>§7.3: Can you offer guidance on how to ensure sufficient uniqueness? “Eternal” seems like a pretty high bar; is that really the intention?<br><br>§10: It doesn’t seem likely that the e2e protection work for Diameter will ever complete, or at least not in the near future. I suggest toning down the hopeful language that talks about it.<br><br><br>*** Editorial Comments and Nits **<br><br>- General: The draft needs at least another proofreading and editing pass to improve readability and clarity. In particular, it needs to be proofread for the following:<br>- plural agreement<br>- Comma usage (there are many placed incorrectly, and many missing where needed)<br>- Proper use of “which” vs “that” (and the associated comma use.)<br>- Convoluted sentence structure<br><br>§2: Please use the new boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>.<br>i<br>§3.1,<br>-&nbsp; first paragraph: “e.g.” requires a comma afterwards: “e.g.,”&nbsp; (There are several instances of this throughout the draft.)<br><br>- "In case of mobile users, the user’s session may get transferred to a<br>new Diameter client during handover and assigned to a different<br>group, which is maintained at the new Diameter client, mid-session.”<br><br>This is hard to parse. I suggest moving “mid-session” to earlier in the sentence. For example, “… session may get transferred mid-session to a new Diameter client…”<br><br>§3.2: I gather this section is an example. If say, please state that explicitly.<br><br>§3.3: <br>- This section uses confusing language to describe which nodes can do what. In particular, it often says “any” node, where I think it means “either the client or the server”. I assume nodes that are not a party to a session-group can’t modify it, correct? Likewise it says “each” node when I think it means “either node”.<br><br>- "Prerequisite for deletion<br>of a session group is that the Diameter node created the session<br>beforehand, hence the node became the group owner.”<br><br>This seems like a complicated way to explain a simple concept. I suggest something to the effect of “A session group may only be deleted by the Diameter node that created it.”<br><br>- "The enforcement of more constrained permissions is left to the<br>specification of a particular group signaling enabled Diameter<br>application and compliant implementations of such application MUST<br>enforce the associated permission model.”<br><br>This is overly complicated language. I suggest something to the effect of ""Diameter application with explicit support for session groups may define a more constrained permission model.” Also, the MUST is not really appropriate; it’s up to the definitions of those applications to set normative requirements on implementations, not _this_ draft.<br><br>- "specification. For example, a more constrained model could require<br>that a client MUST NOT remove a session from a group which is owned<br>by the server.”<br><br>Please do not use normative keywords in an example; examples are by definition non-normative.<br><br>- Default permissions table: I am confused by the “client” and “server” columns. If I understand this section correctly, the role of “client” and “server” is not relevant. (It is telling that each row has the same value in both columns.) Please consider stating this in terms of group “owner” and “non-owner”.<br><br>- Editor’s note: If this draft does not consider overruling a node’s assignment, why talk about it at all?&nbsp; (Although it seems like it _does_ support that, in the sense that a server can reject or change assignments proposed by a client.)<br><br>§4.1: Please avoid normative language in the form of “SHOULD…only…”. That can be ambiguous. It’s better to say “SHOULD NOT … unless. For example, “SHOULD NOT perform group operations with a node unless the node has advertised support”.<br><br>§4.1.1:<br><br>- It seems to me that §4.1.1 and §4.1.2 have “explicit” and “implicit” reversed, in the sense that, if a Diameter application supports groups, then the announcement of group support is “implied” by the announcement of support for the application. OTOH, the use of Session-Group-Capability-Vector is an “explicit” announcement of group support.<br><br>- "New Diameter applications may consider support “<br><br>s/consider/specify<br><br>- "Such applications provide intrinsic discovery for the<br>support of group commands and announce this capability through the<br>assigned application ID.”<br><br>This is confusing. I think you mean support for groups is implied by the announcement of support for the application that explicitly supports it.But it can be read to mean a separate explicit announcement of group support.<br><br>§4.2:<br>- "It is left to the application to<br>determine the policy of session grouping.”<br>Does “application” mean Diameter application, or just “implementation”? Also, this is vague; I think this still talks about limits to the number of groups a&nbsp; session belongs to, which is much more precise than “the policy of session grouping”.<br><br>- The second paragraph seems redundant with §3.3.<br><br>The phrase “single or multiple” would be easier to read as “one or more”. (This pattern repeats throughout the draft, along with some instances of “one or multiple”)<br><br>- “A list of all known session groups should be locally maintained on each<br>node, each group pointing to individual sessions being assigned to<br>the group."<br><br>s/should be/is<br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>- “… the server MUST assign the new session to each of the one<br>or multiple identified session groups when present in …”<br><br>- "If the Diameter server receives a command request from a Diameter<br>client and the command comprises at least one Session-Group-Info AVP”<br><br>s/comprises/includes&nbsp; (“comprises” means “made up of”, which would suggest that the request contains only Session-Group-Info AVPs).&nbsp; (This occurs several times throughout the draft.)<br><br>What does “when” mean in context? Would “...session groups present in…” mean the same thing?<br><br>- "In case one or multiple identified session groups<br>are not already stored by the server”<br><br>“In case” usually refers to planning for a contingency (For example, “I have a fire extinguisher in case of fire”). I suggest “In the case where…” or even better, “If…”&nbsp; (Variations of this pattern occur several times.)<br><br>- "the server MUST store the new<br>identified group(s)”<br>s/new/newly<br><br>- "The server sends the response to the client and<br>MAY include as information to the client only those Session-Group-<br>Info AVPs for which the group assignment failed.”<br><br>Hard to parse.<br><br>- "session. When the Diameter client is<br>confident that the Diameter server supports session grouping…”<br><br>Since this should always be true before the client sends _any_ group operation, why restate it here?<br><br>§4.4.1: <br><br>- "Either Diameter node (client or server) can request the recipient of<br>a request to process an associated command for all sessions being<br>assigned to one or multiple groups by identifying these groups in the<br>request.”<br><br>s/sessions being assigned/sessions assigned<br><br>- Please expand “CCF” on first mention.<br><br>- sentence starting with "When a server sends, as example, a Re-Authorization Request<br>(RAR) or a service-specific server-initiated request…”<br><br>The sentence is hard to parse.<br><br>- "If the sender sends a request including the Group-Response-Action AVP<br>set to ALL_GROUPS (1) or PER_GROUP (2), it MUST expect some delay…”<br><br>“expect” is vague for use in a MUST requirement. Please state this in terms of concrete actions or state it descriptively.<br><br>§A.1, first paragraph: Please don’t use normative keywords to describe requirements defined in other documents. Doing so introduces a high chance of error if either document is updated in the future.</div></td>

The document (-11) was re-reviewed again Dec 2019.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are places for improvement, which are not fatal, though. For<br>&nbsp;  example "AVP" is used before expanding the acronym.<br><br>&nbsp;  In Section 4.1.2 it is not clear whether it is possible for a Diameter node<br>&nbsp;  to withdraw its announcement for group operation support. The current<br>&nbsp;  text says on lines 301-304 to log and remember node's support.<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 6 is currently worded in a way that a group support has to use<br>&nbsp;  existing commands. It should be possible to create new commands for<br>&nbsp;  group support alone with a new Application ID. Although this is not<br>&nbsp;  explicit, it would be the case anyway.<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 7.4. "Group-Response-Action AVP" defines how the node should<br>&nbsp;  follow up with exchanges in response to a command which impacts multiple<br>&nbsp;  sessions. The shepherd chose not to ask for an IANA registry for this AVP.<br>&nbsp;  If one is seen beneficial during the IESG review shepherd's recommendation<br>&nbsp;  for assignment is "Standards Action" policy. However, the shepherd thinks<br>&nbsp;  there are no foreseen new actions without changing the current protocol. <br>&nbsp;  <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. The document has been lingering the DIME WG for a long time<br>&nbsp;  and the people who are interested in this work have already said<br>&nbsp;  their comments.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization?

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No issues.
