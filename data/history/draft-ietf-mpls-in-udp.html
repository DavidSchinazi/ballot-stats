Some are minor editorial<br>points, and a good number of the rest can be handled by the simple <br>addition of text to describe things that I believe need extra words.<br>a few of the issues are a little more significant and need direct<br>discussion or modification of the draft.<br><br>I am not requiring changes, but we do need to talk about any of the<br>points that you don't think need to be addressed by updates to the <br>document.<br><br>Thanks for your work,<br>Adrian<br><br>---<br><br>It seems to me that the issue raised by Sri on the mailing list during<br>WG last call was not addressed. Maybe it was not of concern to this <br>working group because you are only interested in encapsulating MPLS.<br><br>The question asked, however, seems to be very valid for the people<br>charged with looking after UDP port allocation and the future use of<br>UDP. It can be summarised as:<br><br>&nbsp; What would happen if every protocol asked for a port number to <br>&nbsp; encapsulate it? Why don't you ask for a single port number to indicate<br>&nbsp; "there is a payload protocol" and insert a shim to identify and demux <br>&nbsp; the payload?<br><br>I don't have a view on this, but I don't see that the WG either<br>discussed the issue or asked for input from the TSV area. I have asked<br>the TSV ADs to solicit input from the TSV directorate and the Port<br>Doctors. You should not wait for this input (which may come any time<br>between now and the end of IESG evaluation, but you should consider the<br>issue and be prepared to discuss with the reviewers.<br><br>---<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies an additional IP-based encapsulation for <br>&nbsp;  MPLS, referred to as MPLS-in-UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which is <br>&nbsp;  applicable in some circumstances. This document only describes the <br>&nbsp;  MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation. <br><br>"Additional" to what?<br><br>Why "referred to as"? Isn't that exactly what it is?<br><br>The second sentence seems redundant since the first sentence say exactly<br>that.<br><br>"...applicable in some circumstances" says nothing, of course. Either <br>don't say this, or explicitly state the circumstance. Since (see below)<br>the applicability is very specific and there is a clear use case that is<br>the target of your work, I strongly suggest that you call out this case<br>in the Abstract.<br><br>---<br><br>Introduction <br><br>Many of the same comment apply here as I noted for the Abstract, but in<br>addition:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies an additional IP-based encapsulation for <br>&nbsp;  MPLS, referred to as MPLS-in-UDP (User Datagram Protocol). It also <br>&nbsp;  describes the applicability of this encapsulation in presence of <br>&nbsp;  other IP-based encapsulations for MPLS. <br><br>s/presence/the presence/<br><br>&nbsp;  This encapsulation allows for two Label Switching Routers (LSR) to <br>&nbsp;  be adjacent on a Label Switched Path (LSP), while separated by an <br>&nbsp;  IP network. <br><br>This makes it sound like a new feature, but (of course) MPLS-in-IP and<br>MPLS-in-GRE allows this as well. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  In order to support this encapsulation, each LSR needs <br>&nbsp;  to know the capability to decapsulate MPLS-in-UDP by the remote <br>&nbsp;  LSRs. This specification defines only the data plane encapsulation <br>&nbsp;  and does not concern itself with how the knowledge to use this <br>&nbsp;  encapsulation is conveyed. <br><br>While this a fundamentally reasonable thing to say, it also makes the<br>encapsulation entirely unusable. Since implementations already exist,<br>perhaps you could tell us how this works. I suspect that in some<br>environments the ability exist de facto (in other words, all devices are<br>capable) while in other environments it is configured. You could say <br>this and then suggest that distribution of this capability between <br>participating nodes is for future study.<br><br>&nbsp;  An applicability statement will compare situations in which using <br>&nbsp;  the MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation might be advantageous over other IP-<br>&nbsp;  based encapsulations for MPLS. One of the key considerations in <br>&nbsp;  this respect is how to achieve efficient load-balance of traffic <br>&nbsp;  over Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and/or Link Aggregation Group <br>&nbsp;  (LAG). <br><br>I don't understand this paragraph. Are you saying that a future document<br>might be written? That isn't very helpful!<br><br>It appears that you are trying to say "This encapsulation is better than<br>other encapsulations" but without actually demonstrating it. Either<br>delete this paragraph or actually do the work by adding a section to <br>this document.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1<br><br>There is quite a lot missing from this section. I don't mind whether the<br>information goes in the main part of Section 1 or in Section 1.2, but it<br>needs to show up.<br><br>- What environment / use case is this work targeted at?<br>- Forward reference to the Security section and a note about the non-<br>&nbsp; availability of security. This is key since the applicability of this<br>&nbsp; is significantly restricted by this feature.<br>- Brief overview of the mechanism (which is very simple, so doesn't need<br>&nbsp; more than a sentence mentioning "direct encapsulation", "use of dest<br>&nbsp; port" and a high-level observation about using the source port for <br>&nbsp; entropy and why.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Currently, there are a number of IP-based encapsulations for MPLS. <br>&nbsp;  These include MPLS-in-IP, MPLS-in- GRE (Generic Routing <br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation) [<a href="/doc/rfc4023/">RFC4023</a>], and MPLS-in-L2TPv3 (Layer Two Tunneling <br>&nbsp;  Protocol - Version 3)[<a href="/doc/rfc4817/">RFC4817</a>]. In all these methods, the IP <br>&nbsp;  addresses can be varied to achieve load-balancing. <br><br>"These include..." implies you know of others. What are they and why <br>haven't you mentioned them?<br><br>I think the statement about varying the IP addresses could be clearer.<br>Probably by saying how this is done (since simply picking another <br>destination address may balance the load by sending it somewhere else<br>:-)<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In terms of MPLS-based encapsulations, load-balancing is achieved <br>&nbsp;  with the introduction of the Entropy Label [<a href="/doc/rfc6790/">RFC6790</a>].&nbsp; <br><br>I think you need to delete the word "encapsulations".<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>s/ECMP paths/ECMPs/<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>As noted above, the explanation in this section is very sparse and could<br>benefit from additional material.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3 Source Port of UDP<br><br>I think this description needs to describe how a source behaves when the<br>flow does not need entropy.<br><br>Furthermore, the text is not clear about the objective of "providing<br>entropy". What type of algorithm should the source use and what must it<br>not do?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entropy value can be generated by performing hash <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calculation on certain fields in the customer packets <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e.g., the five tuple of UDP/TCP packets).<br><br>I find this to be a poor example because the source has in hand an MPLS<br>packet with an arbitrary label stack and an unknown payload. Indeed, <br>your Section 5 notes that the MPLS payload might not be TCP or UDP.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3 Destination Port of UDP <br><br>The text about upstream/downstream label assignment is perfectly fine,<br>but doesn't belong in the description of this field.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3 UDP Checksum&nbsp; <br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/rfc6935/">RFC 6935</a> says that using a zero UDP checksum for a UDP <br>tunnel is appropriate when the payload protocol header includes its own<br>protection. MPLS headers do not contain this form of protection. How do<br>you justify the zero checksum in this case?<br><br>I also don't think that proper attention has been paid to Section 5 of<br><a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC 6936</a>. You need to examine the requirements and describe additional <br>behavior within your document.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  As for other common processing procedures associated with tunneling <br>&nbsp;  encapsulation technologies including but not limited to Maximum <br>&nbsp;  Transmission Unit (MTU) and preventing fragmentation and reassembly, <br>&nbsp;  Time to Live (TTL) and differentiated services, the corresponding <br>&nbsp;  "Common Procedures" defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc4023/">RFC4023</a>] which are applicable for <br>&nbsp;  MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE encapsulation formats SHOULD be followed.&nbsp; <br><br>I think it is probably important to consider PMTU in the presence of<br>ECMP (probably not necessary in the case of LAG). How does the source<br>know the PMTU for each different value of the source port that it might<br>apply?<br><br>---<br><br>As far as I can see Section 5 is not ECN-friendly and says that when the<br>payload protocol of the MPLS packet is not "TCP-friendly" the <br>application generating the packets must use magic to avoid swamping the<br>network.<br><br>We will see what the TSV area congestion experts have to say, but I <br>think we will find that the approach here is simplistic unless the <br>network across which the UDP tunnel runs is used for no other traffic<br>except UDP tunnels carrying MPLS packets.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 6 seems to indicate a major draw-back of this scheme. You have <br>to note that MPLS networks are able to get away with having very little<br>security because it is very hard to inject MPLS packets into a network.<br>But MPLS-in-(foo-in-)IP encapsulation provides a way to inject packets<br>just like any packet can be injected into an IP network.<br><br>Security (such as IPsec) provides a way to ensure that rogue packets do<br>not have their headers stripped and their payload MPLS packets added to<br>an LSP.<br><br>You are making a clear statement that using IPsec means that there is no<br>point in doing MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation. You need to follow up on this!<br><br>The first thing to do is to enhance the applicability text in Section 1<br>to say where you would deploy this such that security is not an issue.<br><br>The second thing is to talk about the security mechanisms that can be <br>applied at the edges of the network to reduce the likelihood of such<br>attacks being possible.<br><br>Lastly (or probably firstly!) you need to describe the attack vector and<br>the implications of such an attack so that the implementer/deployer is<br>clear what the risks are.<br><br>---<br><br>10.1<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4023/">RFC 4023</a> needs to be a normative reference since you rely on it to <br>describe how to set TTL and avoid fragmentation.</div></td>
