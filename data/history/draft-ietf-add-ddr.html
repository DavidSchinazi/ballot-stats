Hopefully, a BoF/WG in the<br>future will attempt to address this security problem.<br><br>## unresolved DISCUSS items<br><br>Below follows my specific old DISCUSS items that were not addressed.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients MUST NOT automatically use a Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver without some sort of validation<br><br>Why not? What is the alternative? Using unencrypted DNS to the party that<br>told you how and where to contact these (unvalidated) Designated Resolvers.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The client MUST verify that the certificate contains the IP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address of the designating Unencrypted Resolver in a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  subjectAltName extension.<br><br>How feasible is it to get a certificate with SAN=ip from one of the generally<br>accepted root store CA's? Can you give me one example where I can get a certificate<br>for <a href="http://nssec.nohats.ca">nssec.nohats.ca</a> with SAN=193.110.157.123 ?&nbsp; I do not think this is currently<br>possible or easy. If I am right, that means all of Section 4.2 is wishful thinking<br>and not realistic to get rolled out. (I know we can see the cert for 1.1.1.1, so it<br>is possible, but I know of no ACME supported CA that issues these)<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If these checks fail, the client MUST NOT automatically use the<br>&nbsp;  discovered Designated Resolver.<br><br>This creates a strange policy when compared to DNR where if you get a DHCP or RA<br>for the Designated Resolver, which is also not validatable, that you do end up using it?<br>And section 6.5 states DNR trumps DDR.<br>Note: this was updated in -10 to match the DNR, but it matches the weak method of DHCP/RA,<br>so that if the TLS checks fail, it might still end up being used as "Verified Discovery".<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If the Designated Resolver and the Unencrypted Resolver share an IP<br>&nbsp;  address, clients MAY choose to opportunistically use the Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver even without this certificate check (Section 4.3).<br><br>Why only when the IP is the same? Why not for when the IP is different?<br>What's to lose, since the only fallback option is stick to using the<br>unencrypted resolver?<br>###<br><br>Opportunistic Discovery has the same "same IP" issue. As the alternative<br>is to use unencrypted DNS, why not just use it anyway?<br>Note: the text was changed but the issue remains<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  A DNS forwarder SHOULD NOT forward queries for "<a href="http://resolver.arpa">resolver.arpa</a>" upstream.<br><br>Unfortunately, all currently deployed software does not know this, so it will<br>be very common that this happens.<br>Note: Also, why is this not a MUST NOT?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  To limit the impact of discovery<br>&nbsp;  queries being dropped either maliciously or unintentionally, clients<br>&nbsp;  can re-send their SVCB queries periodically.<br><br>I don't see how this would improve security for the client. It also mixes<br>up behaviour of proper DNS clients that have their own retransmit logic<br>for if they get no answer.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 8.2 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-add-svcb-dns/">I-D.ietf-add-svcb-dns</a>] describes a second downgrade<br>&nbsp;  attack where an attacker can block connections to the encrypted DNS<br>&nbsp;  server, and recommends that clients prevent it by switching to SVCB-<br>&nbsp;  reliant behavior once SVCB resolution does succeed.&nbsp; For DDR, this<br>&nbsp;  means that once a client discovers a compatible Designated Resolver,<br>&nbsp;  it SHOULD NOT use unencrypted DNS until the SVCB record expires<br><br>I wonder which attacker can block encrypted DNS connections but not spoof<br>(or block!) an unsigned SVCB record to the local client? And even if that is the case,<br>this would be a denial of service attack if the DNS client cannot fallback<br>to unencrypted DNS. Spoofing an SVCB to a bogus IP with an SVCB TTL of a few<br>hours would be a very cheap 1 packet attack to keep the DNS client down for<br>hours. This seems dangerous to implement.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  DoH resolvers that allow discovery using DNS SVCB answers over<br>&nbsp;  unencrypted DNS MUST NOT provide differentiated behavior based on the<br>&nbsp;  HTTP path alone, since an attacker could modify the "dohpath"<br>&nbsp;  parameter.&nbsp; For example, if a DoH resolver provides provides a<br>&nbsp;  filtering service for one URI path, and a non-filtered service for<br>&nbsp;  another URI path, [...]<br><br>It seems likely that this advise will get ignored a lot, eg by people<br>who have limited public IPs to use to spin up a DoH server, or who have<br>to pay-per-IP. This advise seems more appropriate for local private IP<br>DoH servers. So I would change this MUST NOT to SHOULD NOT for that reason.<br><br>##<br><br>&nbsp;  If the IP address of a Designated Resolver differs from that of an<br>&nbsp;  Unencrypted Resolver, clients applying Verified Discovery<br>&nbsp;  (Section 4.2) MUST validate that the IP address of the Unencrypted<br>&nbsp;  Resolver is covered by the SubjectAlternativeName of the Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver's TLS certificate.<br><br>How would one obtain such a certificate via ACME? Since on the IP of the<br>unencrypted resolver, there would be no HTTP server running? Additionally,<br>if the client notices a failed verification of the Designated Resolver's<br>TLS certificate, wouldn't it fallback to the Unencrypted Resolver? But now<br>it may not? So this becomes a denial of service then ?<br><br>###<br><br>I kind of miss the mode of where there is no indication of DDR or DNR, and<br>you use "unilateral probing" (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dprive-unilateral-probing/">draft-ietf-dprive-unilateral-probing</a>) to just<br>connect to the DoT or DoQ ports of the Unencrypted Resolver and see if you<br>get anything back. It might be unauthenticated TLS but better than port 53?<br><br>## Unresolved Comments<br><br>###<br><br>section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid name lookup deadlock, Designated Resolvers SHOULD follow the<br>&nbsp;  guidance in Section 10 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC8484</a>] regarding the avoidance of DNS-<br>&nbsp;  based references that block the completion of the TLS handshake.<br><br>I find that reference to list more the issues than solutions that can be followed.<br>The solution to use another DoH server is not really appropriate in most cases<br>The client's other interface likely resides on other networks where its private<br>DoH server cannot resolve the name of another network's private DoH server. It is<br>also not easy to get an IP based certificate (eg SAN=ip) that is accepted by general<br>webpki root stores. And things like OCSP stapling doesn't help if the target is<br>malicious - they just would omit the stapling that proves against its malicious use.<br>The only real advise usable from <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC8484</a> is "use the local unencrypted resolver to resolve<br>the encrypted resolver". Might as well say that and remove the 8484 reference.</div></td>

What is the alternative? Using unencrypted DNS to the party that<br>told you how and where to contact these (unvalidated) Designated Resolvers.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  However, if a given Unencrypted Resolver designates a Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver that does not use a private or local IP address and can be<br>&nbsp;  verified using the mechanism described in Section 4.2, it MAY be used<br>&nbsp;  on different network connections so long as the subsequent<br>&nbsp;  connections over other networks can also be successfully verified<br>&nbsp;  using the mechanism described in Section 4.2.<br><br>This seems to go against a lot of advise in the documents that networks must<br>be treated independently. Also, the network _wants_ you to use their designated<br>resolver, so to say it is okay to use a totally different Designated Resolvers<br>seems to violate the whole DNR/DDR architecture.<br><br>This will also cause failure if there is split-DNS or internal-only data.<br><br>Also, using "public IP" is not a good trustworthy method to prove that these<br>IPs are truly the same Designated Resolver used by both networks. I can easily<br>use an internal only zone with <a href="http://dns.nohats.ca">dns.nohats.ca</a>. IN A 8.8.8.8 and get a valid ACME'd<br>certificate with SAN=<a href="http://dns.nohats.ca">dns.nohats.ca</a>. The user connecting to another network might<br>now be switching from my private DNS on my stolen 8.8.8.8 IP to the real google DNS.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The client MUST verify that the certificate contains the IP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address of the designating Unencrypted Resolver in a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  subjectAltName extension.<br><br>How feasible is it to get a certificate with SAN=ip from one of the generally<br>accepted root store CA's? Can you give me one example where I can get a certificate<br>for <a href="http://nssec.nohats.ca">nssec.nohats.ca</a> with SAN=193.110.157.123 ?&nbsp; I do not think this is currently<br>possible or easy. If I am right, that means all of Section 4.2 is wishful thinking<br>and not realistic to get rolled out. (I know we can see the cert for 1.1.1.1, so it<br>is possible, but I know of no ACME supported CA that issues these)<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If these checks fail, the client MUST NOT automatically use the<br>&nbsp;  discovered Designated Resolver.<br><br>This creates a strange policy when compared to DNR where if you get a DHCP or RA<br>for the Designated Resolver, which is also not validatable, that you do end up using it?<br>And section 6.5 states DNR trumps DDR.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If the Designated Resolver and the Unencrypted Resolver share an IP<br>&nbsp;  address, clients MAY choose to opportunistically use the Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver even without this certificate check (Section 4.3).<br><br>Why only when the IP is the same? Why not for when the IP is different?<br>What's to lose, since the only fallback option is stick to using the<br>unencrypted resolver?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If resolving the name of a Designated Resolver from an SVCB record<br>&nbsp;  yields an IP address that was not presented in the Additional Answers<br>&nbsp;  section or ipv4hint or ipv6hint fields of the original SVCB query,<br>&nbsp;  the connection made to that IP address MUST pass the same TLS<br>&nbsp;  certificate checks before being allowed to replace a previously known<br>&nbsp;  and validated IP address for the same Designated Resolver name.<br><br>How does the appearance of an (unsigned) Additional Answer entry convey<br>any kind of real world trust/authentication? In other words, why should<br>it not ALWAYS pass the same TLS certificate checks ?<br><br>###<br><br>Opportunistic Discovery has the same "same IP" issue. As the alternative<br>is to use unencrypted DNS, why not just use it anyway?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  A DNS client that already knows the name of an Encrypted Resolver can<br>&nbsp;  use DDR to discover details about all supported encrypted DNS<br>&nbsp;  protocols.<br><br>It's a little odd to mention this as the DNR draft really tries hard to<br>say to only use the network's offered encrypted DNS servers, so this<br>option is in conflict with the DNR draft.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  A DNS forwarder SHOULD NOT forward queries for "<a href="http://resolver.arpa">resolver.arpa</a>" upstream.<br><br>Unfortunately, all currently deployed software does not know this, so it will<br>be very common that this happens.<br><br>##<br><br>&nbsp;  DNS resolvers that support DDR by responding to queries for<br>&nbsp;  _dns.resolver.arpa SHOULD treat <a href="http://resolver.arpa">resolver.arpa</a> as a locally served<br>&nbsp;  zone per [<a href="/doc/rfc6303/">RFC6303</a>]<br><br>Why is this not a MUST ?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  To limit the impact of discovery<br>&nbsp;  queries being dropped either maliciously or unintentionally, clients<br>&nbsp;  can re-send their SVCB queries periodically.<br><br>I don't see how this would improve security for the client. It also mixes<br>up behaviour of proper DNS clients that have their own retransmit logic<br>for if they get no answer.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 8.2 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-add-svcb-dns/">I-D.ietf-add-svcb-dns</a>] describes a second downgrade<br>&nbsp;  attack where an attacker can block connections to the encrypted DNS<br>&nbsp;  server, and recommends that clients prevent it by switching to SVCB-<br>&nbsp;  reliant behavior once SVCB resolution does succeed.&nbsp; For DDR, this<br>&nbsp;  means that once a client discovers a compatible Designated Resolver,<br>&nbsp;  it SHOULD NOT use unencrypted DNS until the SVCB record expires<br><br>I wonder which attacker can block encrypted DNS connections but not spoof<br>(or block!) an unsigned SVCB record to the local client? And even if that is the case,<br>this would be a denial of service attack if the DNS client cannot fallback<br>to unencrypted DNS. Spoofing an SVCB to a bogus IP with an SVCB TTL of a few<br>hours would be a very cheap 1 packet attack to keep the DNS client down for<br>hours. This seems dangerous to implement.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  DoH resolvers that allow discovery using DNS SVCB answers over<br>&nbsp;  unencrypted DNS MUST NOT provide differentiated behavior based on the<br>&nbsp;  HTTP path alone, since an attacker could modify the "dohpath"<br>&nbsp;  parameter.&nbsp; For example, if a DoH resolver provides provides a<br>&nbsp;  filtering service for one URI path, and a non-filtered service for<br>&nbsp;  another URI path, [...]<br><br>It seems likely that this advise will get ignored a lot, eg by people<br>who have limited public IPs to use to spin up a DoH server, or who have<br>to pay-per-IP. This advise seems more appropriate for local private IP<br>DoH servers. So I would change this MUST NOT to SHOULD NOT for that reason.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  If the IP address of a Designated Resolver differs from that of an<br>&nbsp;  Unencrypted Resolver, clients applying Verified Discovery<br>&nbsp;  (Section 4.2) MUST validate that the IP address of the Unencrypted<br>&nbsp;  Resolver is covered by the SubjectAlternativeName of the Designated<br>&nbsp;  Resolver's TLS certificate.<br><br>How would one obtain such a certificate via ACME? Since on the IP of the<br>unencrypted resolver, there would be no HTTP server running? Additionally,<br>if the client notices a failed verification of the Designated Resolver's<br>TLS certificate, wouldn't it fallback to the Unencrypted Resolver? But now<br>it may not? So this becomes a denial of service then ?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients using Opportunistic Discovery (Section 4.3) MUST be limited<br>&nbsp;  to cases where the Unencrypted Resolver and Designated Resolver have<br>&nbsp;  the same IP address.<br><br>Based on earlier text, this should read "the same non-public IP address".<br><br>###<br><br>I kind of miss the mode of where there is no indication of DDR or DNR, and<br>you use "unilateral probing" (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dprive-unilateral-probing/">draft-ietf-dprive-unilateral-probing</a>) to just<br>connect to the DoT or DoQ ports of the Unencrypted Resolver and see if you<br>get anything back. It might be unauthenticated TLS but better than port 53?<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;  This document calls for the addition of "<a href="http://resolver.arpa">resolver.arpa</a>" to the<br>&nbsp;  Special-Use Domain Names (SUDN) registry established by [<a href="/doc/rfc6761/">RFC6761</a>].<br><br>Why not pick resolver.local? As .local is already handled to not be forwarded<br>by DNS forwarders. It would also not require an addition to SUDN. Even if<br>someone was already using resolver.local, it would not interfere with that usage<br>because that usage would not be using SVCB records.<br><br>## Comments<br><br>###<br><br>section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid name lookup deadlock, Designated Resolvers SHOULD follow the<br>&nbsp;  guidance in Section 10 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC8484</a>] regarding the avoidance of DNS-<br>&nbsp;  based references that block the completion of the TLS handshake.<br><br>I find that reference to list more the issues than solutions that can be followed.<br>The solution to use another DoH server is not really appropriate in most cases<br>The client's other interface likely resides on other networks where its private<br>DoH server cannot resolve the name of another network's private DoH server. It is<br>also not easy to get an IP based certificate (eg SAN=ip) that is accepted by general<br>webpki root stores. And things like OCSP stapling doesn't help if the target is<br>malicious - they just would omit the stapling that proves against its malicious use.<br>The only real advise usable from <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC8484</a> is "use the local unencrypted resolver to resolve<br>the encrypted resolver". Might as well say that and remove the 8484 reference.<br><br>###<br><br>I would argue that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-add-dnr/">I-D.ietf-add-dnr</a> is not an informative but normative reference,<br>as the protocol is mentioned throughout the document as interacting with this protocol.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clients that support SVCB will generally send out three queries<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when accessing web content on a dual-stack network: A, AAAA, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HTTPS queries.&nbsp; Discovering a Designated Resolver as part of one<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of these queries, without having to add yet another query,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; minimizes the total number of queries clients send.<br><br>I don't understand this paragraph. Once clients can send SVCB queries for<br>web content, they already have had to do all the DDR/DNR related queries,<br>so I don't understand the argument of "saving queries" ? Also, it is<br>adding queries for a specific target, eg <a href="http://resolver.arpa">resolver.arpa</a>, and this cannot<br>be "saved" either? What am I misunderstanding here?<br><br>###<br><br>NITS<br><br>provides provides -&gt; provides</div></td>
