I would like to discuss the possiblility of appendix coving the changes mad by this document or what seems like a minor effort to make this the wholesale replacement of 5036.<br><br>this does not rise to the level of a discuss, who knows we may get there. Thanks.<br><br>From Tim Chown: <br><br>I have reviewed this document as part of the Operational directorate's<br>ongoing effort to review all IETF documents being processed by the<br>IESG. These comments were written with the intent of improving the<br>operational aspects of the IETF drafts. Comments that are not addressed<br>in last call may be included in AD reviews during the IESG review.<br>Document editors and WG chairs should treat these comments just like<br>any other last call comments.<br><br>Summary: this document is Ready with Issues.<br><br>This document describes updates to the Label Distribution Protocol as<br>described in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> (and GTSM elements in <a href="/doc/rfc6720/">RFC 6720</a>), to clarify and<br>correct the described or implied behaviour in IPv4-only, IPv6-only and <br>dual-stack deployments.<br><br>Issues:<br><br>* This draft describes a number of ambiguities in particular in dual-stack<br>behaviour, with at least eight such issues being listed in section 1. When<br>reading this draft, in conjunction with <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a>, I personally find it quite<br>tricky to apply the updated rules/guidance described here to the existing<br>text in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a>, due to the rather patchy nature of the document. I would <br>therefore suggest that the authors consider a complete revision to <br><a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> (as happened from <a href="/doc/rfc3036/">RFC 3036</a>), rather than having the <br>clarifications / corrections ‘dangling’ in this additional text. I appreciate<br>that such a revision may be considered overkill, so at the very least this <br>document should include a clear list of changes / updates, perhaps as <br>an appendix.<br><br>* The general principles of the dual-stack / IPv4 / IPv6 operation should<br>be stated early in the document - these are conveyed piece by piece as <br>you read through the document, but it would be helpful to have them <br>clearly stated up front. <br><br>* There is an amount of repetition through the document. I suspect that in<br>the 15 revisions there have been changes made which have caused this.<br>If the document progresses as a standalone document, this should be <br>corrected where possible.&nbsp; As it stands, the document feels disjoint in <br>places, and doesn’t flow anywhere near as well as it could.<br><br>Nits:<br><br>* The specification language section (section 2) should be moved earlier in <br>the document, given abbreviations described therein are used prior to their<br>definition.<br><br>* In 5.1 may wish to mention the IANA registry for IPv6 multicast addresses<br><a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml">http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml</a><br><br>* Last para of 5.1 - why are IPv6 LDP link Hellos to be transmitted first?<br>It would be useful to state the reason.<br><br>* There are various places in the draft that talk about address selection,<br>e.g. in 5.1 and in 5.2; I think these are all consistent with <a href="/doc/rfc6724/">RFC 6724</a>, so <br>perhaps that RFC should be used / cited here?<br><br>* The set of rules in 6.1 repeats some parts of the earlier sections, but not<br>entirely, e.g. the rule in the last para of 5.1 is not included in 6.1. <br><br>* In 6.1.1, para 2, state here that this inclusion of the new TLV is a MUST;<br>this is currently only stated a further page on.<br><br>* In 6.1.1 point 3a) this is a little confusing because earlier the document <br>talks about sending both IPv4 and IPv6 Hello messages, and part c) seems<br>to duplicate parts a) and b) ?<br><br>Tim</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage. In general there can be said that <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> lack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in detail, rules and procedures for using LDP in IPv6 enabled&nbsp; networks <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (IPv6-only or Dual-stack networks).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document. A new version has been posted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressing these comments.<br><br>2014-09-30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document was returned to the wg and the authors due to comments during <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the AD Evaluation and late comments.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These comments were resolved and were verified (mostly) in a short wglc (July 12, 2014).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However there were comments claiming that "some" implementations were not <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible and started to flap LDP sessions. In one case we have been able <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to verify that this a temporary issue that has been resolved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was proposed that this document should be fixed so that both <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and non-comptible implementations would work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In general the Shepherd and wg chairs belive that implementations should be <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  compatible. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some text has been added to this document to address the comment(s). see section 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  paragraph 2.<br> <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage. In general there can be said that <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> lack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in detail, rules and procedures for using LDP in IPv6 enabled&nbsp; networks <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (IPv6-only or Dual-stack networks).<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document. A new version has been posted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressing these comments.<br><br>2014-09-30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document was returned to the wg and the authors due to comments during <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the AD Evaluation and late comments.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These comments were resolved and were verified (mostly) in a short wglc (July 12, 2014).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However there were comments claiming that "some" implementations were not <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible and started to flap LDP sessions. In one case we have been able <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to verify that this a temporary issue that has been resolved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was proposed that this document should be fixed so that both <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and non-comptible implementations would work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In general the Shepherd and wg chairs belive that implementations should be <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  compatible. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some text has been added to this document to address the comment(s). see section 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  paragraph 2.<br> <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage. In general there can be said that <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> lack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in detail, rules and procedures for using LDP in IPv6 enabled&nbsp; networks <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (IPv6-only or Dual-stack networks).<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document. A new version has been posted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressing these comments.<br><br>2014-09-30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document was returned to the wg and the authors due to comments during <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the AD Evaluation and late comments.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These comments were resolved and were verified (mostly) in a short wglc (July 12, 2014).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However there were comments claiming that "some" implementations were not <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible and started to flap LDP sessions. In one case we have been able <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to verify that this a temporary issue that has been resolved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was proposed that this document should be fixed so that both <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and non-comptible implementations would work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In general the Shepherd and wg chairs belive that implementations should be <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  compatible. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some text has been added to this document to address the comment(s). see section 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  paragraph 2.<br> <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage. In general there can be said that <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> lack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in detail, rules and procedures for using LDP in IPv6 enabled&nbsp; networks <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (IPv6-only or Dual-stack networks).<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document. A new version has been posted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressing these comments.<br><br>2014-09-30<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document was returned to the wg and the authors due to comments during <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the AD Evaluation and late comments.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These comments were resolved and were verified (mostly) in a short wglc (July 12, 2014).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However there were comments claiming that "some" implementations were not <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible and started to flap LDP sessions. In one case we have been able <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to verify that this a temporary issue tht has been resolved.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It was proposed that this document should be fixed so that both <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> compatible<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and non-comptible implementations would work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In genral the Shepherd and wg chairs belive that implementations should be <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  compatible. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some text has been added to this document to address the comment(s). see section 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  paragraph 2.<br> <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification?

If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage. In general there can be said that <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> lack<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in detail, rules and procedures for using LDP in IPv6 enabled&nbsp; networks <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (IPv6-only or Dual-stack networks).<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document. A new version has been posted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressing these comments.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A mail has been sent to the working group asking for implementations and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the shepherd write-up will be updated as we receive this information.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  So far this implementation poll has resulted in that we know of one <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  implementation under way.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The key reviewers are all mentioned in the acknowledgment section.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are significant vendor and operator interest in this draft. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  No MB Doctor or Media Type reviews are necessary.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Loa Andersson is the Document Shepherd.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Adrian Farrel is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document several times, before<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wg adoption poll and both wglc's. But also while resolving the outstanding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; issues. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns! <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such reviews needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such concerns, all the outstanding issues have been resolved.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All the authors has stated on the working group mailing list that they<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unaware of an IPR related to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are no IPR disclosures relevant to this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has taken time, but the working group does now support this document.&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such threats!<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document passes the nits tool clean.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The nits tool gives a warning about IP addresses not compliant to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and <a href="/doc/rfc3849/">RFC3849</a>: however the IP addresses in the document are not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  examples in the sense defined in these RFCs.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The nits tool also point that we use a "disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work".<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the time being this disclaimer is correct, but for reasons partly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  outside the scope of this document we have started process to see if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  if the authors/contributors to <a href="/doc/rfc3036/">RFC 3036</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> and this document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are willing to grant the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> rights to the IPR trust.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We have identified 17 authors and contributors to <a href="/doc/rfc3036/">RFC 3036</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6/">draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-ipv6</a> that needs to grant the BFC 78 rights for these documents<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to the IETF Trust.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  So far there are two (2) that we have are not certain that&nbsp; we have managed to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  find mail addresses to; there are eight (8) that have not yet responded to the mail<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sent out; and&nbsp; seven (7) that have responded that they are willing to grant their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> rights. Considering that&nbsp; this has been done during the Holiday season<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it is not bad.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shepherd write-up will be updated as further responses are received.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: that if we fail to receive acknowledgment from all, we can still go ahead <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keeping the&nbsp;  pre-BCP 78 in the document.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such reviews necessary<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes they have been correctly split.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All normative references as to existing standards track RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>, this is well captured in the Abstract and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the Introduction.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No new IANA registries that require Expert Review. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sections written in formal language.<br><br></div></td>

An LDP Hello packet received on any of the other<br>&nbsp;  destination addresses must be dropped.

If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The LDP [<a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>] specification defines procedures and messages for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  exchanging FEC-label bindings over either IPv4 or IPv6 or networks deploying<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  both&nbsp; types of technologies (e.g. dual-stack networks).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Although LDP is defined in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> so that it may be used over IPv4 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or IPv6, <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> really does not really allow for interoperable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  implementations of LDP over IPv6. In this respect <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC 5036</a> is too<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  under-specified to be implemented over IPv6.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Consequently, this document list 7 deficiencies in <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a> (see the Introduction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  that needs to be addressed to allow interoperable LDP implementations in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6 networks<br>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The documen and also specifies how these deficiencies should be adressed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  in regards to IPv6 usage.

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document has a rather long history even though&nbsp; it is a document that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  focused to address a limited scope of issues - some of the issues are in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  themselves of considerable complexity<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The first individual version of this draft was published in February 2008,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it was well received, but the timing was a bit unfortunate, it was about the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  time as the start of the MPLS-TP work and the MPLS wg were a bit swamped<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by a large number of MPLS-TP drafts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, we had a good discussion on the list and the document was accepted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as a working group document in November 2010. Followed by a good discussion,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and the wglc in Aug 2011 were uneventful due to that the&nbsp; issues had been<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addressed. However after reposting a new version there were some questions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  put to the working group and that generated further comments. One of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments turned out to be hard to resolve given the disagreement between the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authors and reviewers.. It had to do&nbsp; with the number of LDP Hello<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adjacencies needed to be kept and maintained on the receiver side between <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a pair LSRs with both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, it did take us quite a long&nbsp; time <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to resolve this.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When we had the resolution we did a short working group last call on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  changes that been introduced between the two working group last calls. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This short wglc call only received supportive comments. The current version <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is agreed upon by all parties.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However it would not be this document if we had not received a new set of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  comments outside the scope of the short working group last call. The comments <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are supportive and will improve the document.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It has taken time, but the working group does now support this document.&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such threats!<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Considering that&nbsp; this has been done during the Holiday season<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it is not bad.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shepherd write-up will be updated as further responses are received.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: that if we fail to receive acknowledgment from all, we can still go ahead <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keeping the&nbsp;  pre-BCP 78 in the document.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No such reviews necessary<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes they have been correctly split.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All normative references as to existing standards track RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc5036/">RFC5036</a>, this is well captured in the Abstract and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and in the Introduction.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.
