As soon as this discussion is addressed, I'll switch to "Yes".<br><br>I disagree with the change to section 3 in the RFC Editor Note, as it does not represent IETF consensus. The current text as stated in the document is fine. I feel that any discussion of the "transition" from broken algorithms to good ones (not to mention the transition from cleartext to encrypted) is really orthogonal to this document: This document is saying that, if clear text is permitted, the protocol will work it's way up from clear text (if possible) to the best security it is able to achieve. That includes encryption using broken algorithms, which is still better than clear text to prevent a passive observer, who might not be willing to invest in saving the data and decrypting it later, from seeing the data. That we want to transition away from broken algorithms is as true as the fact that we want to transition away from clear text, but even the latter is not currently mentioned in the document, except by implication in the last paragraph of section 3.<br><br>I think a reasonable compromise is to add some discussion of broken algorithms to the last paragraph of section 3:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  Cleartext is supported for backwards compatibility with systems<br>&nbsp;  already deployed.&nbsp; Even when cleartext needs to be supported,<br>&nbsp;  protocol designs based on Opportunistic Security prefer to encrypt,<br>&nbsp;  employing cleartext only with peers that do not appear to be<br>&nbsp;  encryption capable.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The support of cleartext and the use of outdated algorithms, and<br>&nbsp;  especially broken algorithms, is for backwards compatibility with<br>&nbsp;  systems already deployed.&nbsp; Protocol designs based on Opportunistic<br>&nbsp;  Security prefer to encrypt, and prefer to use the best available<br>&nbsp;  encryption algorithms available. OS protocols employ cleartext or<br>&nbsp;  broken encryption algorithms only with peers that do not appear to be<br>&nbsp;  capable of doing otherwise.<br><br>If Stephen or others insist that transition be mentioned, you could add a sentence to that paragraph, and I am likely willing to hold my nose:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eventual desire is to transition<br>&nbsp;  away from cleartext and broken algorithms, and particularly for<br>&nbsp;  broken algorithms, it is highly desirable to remove such<br>&nbsp;  functionality from implementations.<br><br>But I really don't believe that such a sentence belongs in this document; if it does, it probably belongs in every Security Considerations section ever written that mentions the use of cleartext or encryption algorithms.</div></td>

However, the use of "broken" algorithms,<br>&nbsp;  especially ones for which a ciphertext-only attack may be<br>&nbsp;  feasible in the near term, is not consistent with the OS<br>&nbsp;  approach. In such cases, avoiding the "broken" cipher, and<br>&nbsp;  falling back to cleartext is in fact the correct outcome, as<br>&nbsp;  recorded ciphertext for an algorithm with a feasible<br>&nbsp;  ciphertext-only attack is really the same as cleartext. That<br>&nbsp;  said, there may be cases where an implementation does negotiate<br>&nbsp;  use of such an algorithm for some (hopefully) short period<br>&nbsp;  with (hopefully) very few peers, while software and/or<br>&nbsp;  configurations are in the process of being updated, but this<br>&nbsp;  should be considered a failure (to update) and not as an<br>&nbsp;  acceptable outcome that is consistent with the OS approach.</div></td>

(For those playing at home, I'm hanging my hat on the last bullet of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/discuss-criteria.html#stand-disc">http://www.ietf.org/iesg/statement/discuss-criteria.html#stand-disc</a> for this.) Let's start with the Intro:<br><br>&nbsp;  Broadly speaking, Opportunistic Security (OS) is a pragmatic risk<br>&nbsp;  management approach.&nbsp; With Opportunistic Security, one applies the<br>&nbsp;  tools at hand to mitigate the risks that can reasonably be addressed,<br>&nbsp;  and accepts the rest.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This is new text, not an editorial change. I find both of those sentences, and most of the other sentences in the Introduction, completely useless to the task of explaining what is important about OS, and unfortunately I think the Introduction as a whole now makes it *harder* for the reader to understand what OS is. I don't think there is community consensus that the new intro captures the intent. Most importantly:<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus, use of an OS protocol<br>&nbsp;  may yield communication that is authenticated and encrypted,<br>&nbsp;  unauthenticated but encrypted, or cleartext.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I find completely insidious because it damages the message of 1.2: Instead of a build up from a base of cleartext, which I absolutely agree is the way we should be thinking about security and is the essential bit of the OS model, this sentence and the one that follows it reinforce the notion that we start from fully authenticated communication and work our way down, precisely the notion that this document is supposed to be moving us away from. -03 made it clear to me that there was an order to things. It said that there was "stepping up from" cleartext. That text disappeared. In its place, there is the above text that apparently has the steps in the reverse order. The definition of the term in -04 doesn't even refer to the order. I do not remember seeing any discussion in which the participants came to consensus that this discussion of order should be removed.<br><br>The definition presented in this section also hides this important point.<br><br>The two essential bits of intro are the first paragraph of section 1.1 (which was once the first paragraph of the document) and the first two paragraphs of section 1.2, and we don't get to read them for another 6 to 15 paragraphs. They&nbsp; need to be moved up and the rest of this new intro needs to be deleted.<br><br>In section 3:<br><br>&nbsp;  Coexist with local policy:&nbsp; Local security policies preempt OS.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Opportunistic security never displaces or preempts local policy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many applications and types of data are too sensitive to use OS,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and more traditional security designs are appropriate in such<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cases.<br><br>The title of section 3 is "Opportunistic Security Design Principles". Coexisting with local policy is not part of the OS design principle; it's a caveat to that design principle for times when you should *not* use OS. Again, this undermines the discussion of OS, and I do not believe that the community has consensus that the above is part of the OS design principle.<br><br>(One overarching point: Others have made comments with other serious problems that need fixing. That's fine. But if the result of addressing my comments or other folks's comments is to *add* more text, you've probably gotten it wrong. The main problem with -04 is the text that it added. Text needs to be deleted and simplified.)<br><br>This is important work and really needs to be done. In retrospect, I would have preferred to see this work done as a BCP in UTA or as an IAB document instead of simply a definition document. But we are where we are. We need to come to consensus on the text in here. We're not there yet.</div></td>

I think it is a helpful contribution.<br><br>On process, prior to taking a deep dive into the LC mailing list traffic and talking with the AD, shepherd, and author, I was originally skeptical about whether this document had achieved rough consensus and whether IETF process had been followed effectively. After having taken those steps, I am convinced that both are true. <br><br>I also now understand why the term "opportunistic security" was chosen and believe there is rough consensus in support of using that term.<br><br>However, for a document that is quite short and a concept that is fairly straightforward, I find this document really difficult to understand in places. I've listed the bits that are so ambiguous that I think readers will not understand them as DISCUSS points and other comments as COMMENT points.<br><br>DISCUSS: <br><br>o Section 1:<br>"For a particular protocol or application, if and when all but a<br>&nbsp;  negligible fraction of peers support encryption, the baseline<br>&nbsp;  security may be raised from cleartext to always require encryption.<br>&nbsp;  Similarly, once support for authentication is near-universal, the<br>&nbsp;  baseline may be raised to always require authentication."<br><br>I agree with Adrian that it is unclear what this means. And in fact it seems to contradict other language in the document by assuming that a protocol has one mode of operation for *all* peers. I thought one of the goals of OS was that within any single protocol interaction or within any single group of peers, the level of encryption used could be negotiated up to the lowest common denominator among the peers. Perhaps this would be clearer if it emphasized that the default mode for a particular protocol or application might be chosen to be cleartext, unauthenticated encryption, or authenticated encryption, with the ability for peers to negotiate up if they are capable.<br><br><br>o Section 1:<br>"In essence, OS is employed when one might otherwise settle for cleartext<br>&nbsp;  (or the minimum protection possible if the protocol is always<br>&nbsp;  encrypted)." <br><br>I don't understand the parenthetical, either in substance or grammar.<br><br><br>o Section 1:<br>"For example, a policy might require authenticated, encrypted<br>&nbsp;  communication, in contrast to the default OS security policy."<br><br>This sentence presents another reason why the previous paragraph does not make sense. The previous paragraph seems to say that in some cases, the default OS security policy could be to use authenticated encryption. In those cases, this sentence is not correct.<br><br><br>o Section 1.2:<br>I find the document's guidance about the extent to which OS protocols "work behind the scenes" to be confusing. There is this text in this section:<br><br>"OS protocols work<br>&nbsp;  transparently behind the scenes, without disrupting communication.<br><br>&nbsp;  When less than complete protection is negotiated, there is no need to<br>&nbsp;  prompt the user with "your security may be degraded, please click OK"<br>&nbsp;  dialogs.&nbsp; The negotiated protection is as good as can be expected.<br>&nbsp;  Even if not comprehensive, it is often better than the traditional<br>&nbsp;  outcome of either "no protection" or "communications failure"."<br><br>And then in Section 3 there is this:<br><br>"No misrepresentation of security:&nbsp; Unauthenticated, encrypted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; communication must not be misrepresented to users or in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; application logs of non-interactive applications as equivalent to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authenticated, encrypted communication."<br><br>The bit about working "behind the scenes" and not prompting the user seems to me to be distinct from the issue of misrepresenting security. That is, (1) whether the user is proactively informed of the extent to which his communications are protected, (2) whether the user is able to find out about that protection on his own, and (3) whether the information provided to the user about that protection is accurate are three separate questions. I find that Section 1.2 argues against (1), although this is not elevated to the level of a "design principle" as it is not included in Section 3. Section 3 argues in favor of (3) -- providing accurate information -- and includes that as a design principle. I believe the document is silent about (2).<br><br>I get the sense that (1) is viewed by people who worked on this document as an important by-product of wider deployment of OS, so I would have expected support for it to be more explicit in the document, rather than somewhat latent as it is. If there were a fuller discussion of (1), I would also expect (2) to be addressed, as it is natural to ask just how "behind the scenes" OS protocols are expected to be (as Adrian pointed out). This seems like a fairly significant gap in the document.</div></td>

I would suggest adding an opening paragraph along the lines of "This section provides some background about historic and current challenges associated with the use of encryption on the Internet, illustrated using discussion of the Web PKI."<br><br><br>o Section 1.1:<br>s/With so many certification authorities, which not everyone is willing to trust,<br>&nbsp;  the communicating parties don't always agree on a mutually trusted<br>&nbsp;  CA./With so many certification authorities, all of which are not trusted by all entities, the communicating parties don't always agree on a mutually trusted<br>&nbsp;  CA./<br><br><br>o Section 1.1:<br>"In interactive<br>&nbsp;  applications, security warnings are all too frequent, and end-users<br>&nbsp;  learn to actively ignore security problems"<br><br>This point is orthogonal to the rest of the paragraph to which it is attached. The fact that choices were made to pop security warnings was separate from other choices made about the web PKI.

It is rather out of place in Section 1.2.<br><br><br>o Section 3:<br>"OS offers an incremental path to authenticated, encrypted communication in the<br>&nbsp;  future, as suitable authentication technologies are deployed."<br><br>As in Section 1, this text seems to assume one mode of operation for a particular protocol. What about protocols that can already support authenticated encryption? Doesn't OS offer an incremental path towards using that mode right now, not in the future, for peers that already support it?<br><br><br>o Section 3:<br>s/Communication should generally<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be at least encrypted./At a minimum, communication should generally<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be encrypted without authentication./<br><br>(I think this was the intention here, although I'm not completely sure what "at least" means.)</div></td>

You seem to be defining "Best Effort Security". Hey-ho.

Only encryption can do this<br>2. Using only encryption with nothing else can only go so far<br>I suggest you make some clarification to remove this ambiguity.<br><br>"this risk is consistent with the expected..." I don't think so.

Is it<br>the peer capabilities that can protect against MiTM attacks? Or is it <br>the authentication that does the protection? I think you are saying...<br>&nbsp;  In order that authentication mechanisms can protect against active<br>&nbsp;  MiTM attacks on capability exchanges between peers, those capability<br>&nbsp;  exchanges need to be performed over...<br><br>But why are you insistent on an out-of-band channel? Surely any <br>authenticated channel that is resistant to MiTM attacks will be good<br>enough?<br><br>---<br><br>&nbsp;  OS protocols will attempt to establish encrypted communication<br>&nbsp;  whenever both parties are capable of such, and authenticated<br>&nbsp;  communication if that is also possible.&nbsp; This last outcome will<br>&nbsp;  occur if not all parties to a communication support encryption (or if<br>&nbsp;  an active attack makes it appear that this is the case).<br><br>Is there any element of choice here? The text says not.<br><br>---<br><br>&nbsp;  For a particular protocol or application, if and when all but a<br>&nbsp;  negligible fraction of peers support encryption, the baseline<br>&nbsp;  security may be raised from cleartext to always require encryption.<br>&nbsp;  Similarly, once support for authentication is near-universal, the<br>&nbsp;  baseline may be raised to always require authentication.<br><br>I don't know what this means!<br>I think it says that at some moment in time the Internet Police will <br>ban the use of unencrypted use of a protocol or application. Or maybe<br>it says that new implementations can require encryption and refuse to<br>operate with legacy implementations.

It is not a discussion <br>you need to have here.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  For some applications or protocols the set of potential peers<br>&nbsp;  includes a long tail of implementations that support only cleartext.<br><br>On third reading I got what the "long tail" refers to. How about...<br><br>&nbsp;  For some applications or protocols it is anticipated that the set of<br>&nbsp;  potential peers that only support cleartext will persist for a long<br>&nbsp;  time.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This document proposes a change of perspective.<br><br>Why is it a proposal in what you plan to publish as an IETF Consensus<br>RFC? I assume you don't really want this to be Experimental.<br><br>---<br><br>I am fine with the concept of opportunistic security and like it. But<br>I think I reject the hypothesis in Section 1.2 that the old world is<br>"expect full security and notify when not achieved" and that the new<br>world is "expect no security and get the best you can." I think the new<br>world is / should be "configure the level of security that is acceptable<br>to you, get at least that security and maybe better, or get notified if <br>it is not as good." This is more subtle than your proposal but involves <br>the user in a way that I think is important. That is, if a user desires <br>security, it is not enough to say "the protocol is designed to get as<br>much security as it can" - the user actually wants to know if the<br>security level is low, and may want no traffic if the security level is<br>too low.<br><br>This does not reject the idea of OS, but merely the choice presented in<br>Section 1.2.<br><br>In fact, Section 3 makes these trade-offs pretty clear, so I think<br>that all that is needed is to moderate the language in this section.<br>(Although Section 5 seems to favour some sort of autonomy within the <br>protocol or protocol implementation such that various fallbacks might<br>"just happen".)<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  OS provides a near-term approach to counter passive attacks by<br>&nbsp;  removing barriers to the widespread use of encryption.<br><br>This is probably true, and definitely a motivation, and not a Design<br>Principle. Not appropriate in this section of the document.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 3<br><br>I had to read "Emphasize enabling communication" and the following text<br>a couple of time to extract the right meaning. What you have has two<br>different meanings, and you mean "enablement of" (otherwise "an <br>enabling communication" is inferred).<br><br>---<br><br>Section 5 has...<br><br>&nbsp;  The choice<br>&nbsp;  to implement or enable fallback should only be made in response to<br>&nbsp;  significant operational obstacles.<br><br>...but no mention of who makes the choice for enablement. I think you <br>need that such fallback is never a default action and always requires<br>operator/user intervention since forcing such a fallback sounds like an<br>effective attack.<br><br>---<br><br>One point that I would possibly have entered as a Discuss were I not<br>Abstaining is that I am surprised that there is no discussion of <br>mechanisms that can be used to detect MiTM attacks on unauthenticated<br>encryption key exchanges. Detection is a useful tool since, while it <br>can't help with protection of data, it can at least warn the user to <br>stop relying on the security of the data channel.</div></td>

Summary<br><br>This is the shepherd writeup for draft-dukhovni-opportunistic-security-04. Paul Hoffman is the<br>document shepherd, and Stephen Farrell is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>The document defines the term "Opportunistic Security" and gives the design philosophy and<br>principles behind it. Using opportunistic security leads to the use of encryption in situations<br>which would otherwise use unencrypted communication. This document does not define a protocol, and<br>does not give a single method for attaining opportunistic security. The publication type is<br>Informational, which is appropriate for this type of overview publication.<br><br><br>2. Review and Consensus<br><br>The document and its predecessors were discussed with great gusto over many months on the SAAG<br>mailing list, in the UTA WG, and at two IETF meetings. There is a great deal of interest in having a<br>common set of definitions for the ideas related ot opportunistic security, even where there might be<br>disagreement about where it should and should not be used.<br><br>The IETF Last Call on the -03 draft produced a lot of suggestions for major improvements to the<br>language in the draft, and the author did a significant revision based on them, all without changing<br>the design philosophy. There are probably still some people who think that the wording is not what<br>they would want, and some who think that the whole idea is a bad one, but there was rough consensus<br>that the document was useful and should be published.<br><br>The document has had more review, and ended up getting stronger consensus for the eventual<br>definition, than the products of many security WGs. Because this document does not define how to<br>implement opportunistic security, there is some disagreement about its applicability to existing and<br>future IETF protocols, but there was strong agreement that the definition was good enough for many<br>protocols.<br><br><br>3. Intellectual Property<br><br>The author has stated that his direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document (that<br>is: none) has already been disclosed, in conformance with BCPs 78 and 79.<br><br>4.

Paul Hoffman is the document shepherd, and Stephen Farrell is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>The document defines the term "opportunistic security" and gives a concise design philosophy to support it. Using opportunistic security leads to the use of encryption in situations which would otherwise use unencrypted communication. This document does not define a protocol or a particular method for attaining opportunistic security, and the publication type is Informational.<br><br><br>2. Review and Consensus<br><br>The document and its predecessors were discussed with great gusto over many months on the SAAG mailing list, in the UTA WG, and at two IETF meetings. There is a great deal of interest in having a common set of definitions for the ideas related ot opportunistic security, even where there might be disagreement about where it should and should not be used.<br><br>The document has had more review, and ended up getting stronger consensus for the eventual definition, than the products of many security WGs. Because this document does not define how to implement opportunistic security, there is some disagreement about its applicability to existing and future IETF protocols, but there was strong agreement that the definition was good enough for many protocols.<br><br><br>3.
