Although the<br>examples described in Section 9 specify means to configure MPLS-TP<br>tunnels in a similar way to the examples in [<a href="/doc/rfc3812/">RFC3812</a>], this should be<br>seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the specified<br>circumstances having been configured by alternative means.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document defines a portion of the MIB for use with network management<br>&nbsp;  protocols, and describes managed objects for Tunnels, Identifiers, Label<br>&nbsp;  Switching Router and Textual conventions for MPLS-TP. <br><br>&nbsp;  These MIB modules extend the existing MPLS MIB objects for both MPLS<br>&nbsp;  and MPLS-TP operations, because of this the MPLS-TP name is not included <br>&nbsp;  in the MIB module names.<br><br>&nbsp;  The existing MPLS-TE MIB [<a href="/doc/rfc3812/">RFC3812</a>] and the GMPLS-TE MIB [<a href="/doc/rfc4802/">RFC4802</a>] do <br>&nbsp;  not support the transport network requirements of NON-IP based management <br>&nbsp;  and static bidirectional tunnels. The MIB modules defined&nbsp; in <br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-te-mib/">draft-ietf-mpls-tp-te-mib</a> should be used in conjunction with [<a href="/doc/rfc3812/">RFC3812</a>] and <br>&nbsp;  its companion document [<a href="/doc/rfc3813/">RFC3813</a>] for MPLS-TP tunnel configuration and<br>&nbsp;  management.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; There has been no such rough consensus decisions.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of several implementations of the MIB module.<br>&nbsp;  There are&nbsp; significant number of vendors that either has or<br>&nbsp;  will implement the MIB module.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>Director?<br>&nbsp; Loa Andersson is the Document Shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Adrian Farrel is the Responsible Area Director <br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Document Shepherd has review the document priori to the poll<br>&nbsp;  to make it a working document and prior to the working group last call.<br>&nbsp;  However it should be noted that the Document Shepherd is not an MIB<br>&nbsp;  expert, the real detailed review has been performed by Joan Cucchiara,<br>&nbsp;  both in the MPLS-RT review and during wglc (as a repreentative) for the<br>&nbsp;  MIB Doctors.<br><br>&nbsp; This version is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The reviews performed by the working group and the MIB doctors<br>&nbsp;  are what is needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author has confirmed on the mpls mailing list that they are <br>&nbsp;  unaware of any IPR that relates to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IPR disclosures against this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The working group supports this document. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such conflicts or discontent.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document passes the not-check clean.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has been reviewed by and discussed with the MIB Doctors.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  All the normative references are to existing RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No - no downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such changes to other RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The IANA section is well and clearly written, all the registries are <br>&nbsp;  clearly identified.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  No new IANA registries, no new future expert reviews needed.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Shepherd has not personally verified the MIB definitions. <br><br>&nbsp;  The authors confirmed that the MIB module has been compiled<br>&nbsp;  and verified.<br><br><br></div></td>
