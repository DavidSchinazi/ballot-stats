 In order to accommodate deployments relying upon keying material per<br>&nbsp;  SFC/SFP and also the need to update keys after encrypting NSH data<br>&nbsp;  for a certain amount of time, this document uses key identifiers to<br>&nbsp;  unambiguously identify the appropriate keying material.&nbsp; Doing so<br>&nbsp;  addresses the problem of synchronization of keying material.<br><br>I included a suggestion in my pull request, but I want to call out as a<br>potentially significant change that the key identifier should identify<br>not just the key material but also the algorithms that they key is to be<br>used with.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Nonce Length:&nbsp; Carries the length of the Nonce.&nbsp; If the Context<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Headers are only integrity protected, "Nonce Length" is set to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; zero (that is, no "Nonce" is included).&nbsp; The "Nonce Length" can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set to zero depending on the encryption algorithm used to encrypt<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Context Headers.<br><br>I included this in my PR, but want to call out that this last sentence<br>seems harmful.&nbsp; It seems vastly preferrable to have "the nonce length<br>field is zero" indicate one specific thing, rather than having two<br>different possibilities for that situation, as this text appears to do.<br>I know that my earlier comments proposed a scenario where an AEAD might<br>validly encrypt with a zero-length nonce, but I don't think we should<br>support that at the cost of losing the clear signal that the encrypted<br>context headers are (not) present.<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Using the secret key (ENC_KEY) and authenticated encryption<br>&nbsp;  algorithm, the NSH imposer encrypts the Context Headers (as set, for<br>&nbsp;  example, in Section 3) and inserts the resulting payload in the "MAC<br>&nbsp;  and Encrypted Metadata" Context Header (Section 5).&nbsp; The entire<br>&nbsp;  Context Header carrying a sensitive metadata is encrypted (that is,<br>&nbsp;  including the MD Class, Type, Length, and associated metadata of each<br>&nbsp;  Context Header).<br><br>I included some text in my pull request, but want to call out as<br>important that this description does not specify what is to be used as<br>the "additional authenticated data" AEAD input.&nbsp; (I assume the empty<br>string is intended, though other choices are valid.)<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>&nbsp;  When an SFC data plane element conforms to this specification, it<br>&nbsp;  MUST ensure that a "MAC and Encrypted Metadata" Context Header is<br>&nbsp;  included in a received NSH packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This doesn't quite seem like the right condition -- this text sounds<br>like once you implement this context header you have to require that it<br>appears in all incoming packets, which breaks interoperability with<br>senders that don't produc this contxt header.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  The secret key (K) must have an expiration time assigned as the<br>&nbsp;  latest point in time before which the key may be used for integrity<br>&nbsp;  protection of NSH data and encryption of Context Headers.&nbsp; Prior to<br>&nbsp;  the expiration of the secret key, all participating NSH-aware nodes<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD have the control plane distribute a new key identifier and<br>&nbsp;  associated keying material so that when the secret key is expired,<br>&nbsp;  those nodes are prepared with the new secret key.&nbsp; This allows the<br>&nbsp;  NSH imposer to switch to the new key identifier as soon as necessary.<br>&nbsp;  It is RECOMMENDED that the next key identifier and associated keying<br>&nbsp;  material be distributed by the control plane well prior to the secret<br>&nbsp;  key expiration time.<br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-limits/">draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-limits</a> offers some guidance on how<br>often to rekey (though it gives data-based criteria, not time-based<br>ones), if that is potentially relevant.</div></td>

As already communicated by email, I am now clearing my previous DISCUSS ballot (kept below only for archiving purposes), I am also trusting the responsible AD about my previous COMMENT points.<br><br>Special thanks to Greg Mirsky for his shepherding especially about his summary of the WG consensus.<br><br>I hope that this helps to improve the document,<br><br>Regards,<br><br>-éric<br><br>PS: your reply was lost in the ‘fury’ ot the IETF week, sorry about that and please thank your AD, Martin Vigoureux, for sending me today a gentle nudge...<br><br>== previous DISCUSS (for archive only as the current revision addresses all the points) ==<br><br>I failed to spot the order of the operations for the integrity and confidentiality operations, e.g., I did not find on what the HMAC is computed: in the unencrypted or encrypted field ?<br><br>-- Section 5.1 --<br>What is the unit of "key length", I assume a length expressed in octets but it is not specified.<br><br>-- Section 7.2 --<br>What is the "A" used in the HMAC computation ?<br><br>The formula specifies HMAC-SHA-256-128() but what if another HMAC is used ? Section 7.3 use MAC() which is more flexible.<br><br>As the MAC field is included in the integrity protected header, please specify the value of this field when computing the HMAC (I assume 0 but let's be clear)<br><br>-- Section 7.5 --<br>What is the expected behavior when a NSH does not contain a "MAC and Encrypted Metadata" Context Header ? §1 hints to packet drop ? Should there be a local policy for this case ?<br><br>I second Alvaro's and Lars' point about formally updating <a href="/doc/rfc8300/">RFC 8300</a>.<br><br>Quite often in the text "privacy-sensitive metadata" is used but encryption is not only required for privacy but also to protect operational data from attackers (i.e., not linked to privacy), is there a real need to qualify "metadata" with "privacy-sensitive", i.e., "confidential metadata" may be more appropriate ?<br><br>-- Section 4.1.1 --<br>The use of 'metadata' (notably in table 1) for 'context headers' is confusing for a first-time reader. Any chance to be consistent and only use 'context headers' ?<br><br>-- Section 4.2 --<br>At first reading, I am confused by the use of the word 'secret key' for what appears to be a 'shared key'. Or is this 'secret key' never shared and simply used to generate the secondary keys, which are then shared ? Even if discussed later, some early explanations would be welcome.<br><br>-- Section 5.1 --<br>Is there a good reason why the field name "key length" is not "key ID length" ? <br><br>I also find very strange to define "Length: variable" as the header field itself as a fixed length, simply state "unsigned integer".<br><br>As timestamp can include fractions of second, which is a good thing, then please reword "expressed in seconds relative" to indicate that fraction of second is included. <br><br>The 32-bit epoch will wrap around in 2036, should this I-D already consider what to do at that moment ?<br><br>-- Section 8 --<br>Indeed MTU is always an interesting 'problem' but how is this extension different than plain NSH ? The NSH neither increases nor decreases on the fly with this document.<br><br><br>== NITS ==<br><br><br>-- Section 3 --<br>Should 'figure 1' be 'table 1' per consistency with section 4.1.1 ?</div></td>

this DISCUS takes precedence.)<br>I fear that the construction that separately distributes ENC_KEY and<br>MAC_KEY in an attempt to achieve privilege separation is fatally flawed.<br>In particular, the CBC encryption mode is a malleable encryption mode,<br>in that flipping a bit of ciphertext will filp the corresponding bit of<br>the next block of recovered plaintext (at the cost of completely<br>garbling the recovered block containing the bit that was modified).<br>Subsequent blocks are unaffected.&nbsp; Typically we combine CBC mode with a<br>MAC such as HMAC in order to prevent such modifications from being<br>exposed as attack vectors, and while we do use HMAC here for that<br>purpose, we also introduce a separate class of actors that have access<br>to the HMAC key but not the encryption key.&nbsp; Accordingly, those actors<br>can produce a new, valid, integrity tag after making a modification to<br>the ciphertext, allowing them to engage in attacks that make use of<br>ciphertext malleability.&nbsp; Ciphertext malleability is particularly useful<br>as an attack vector when the structure of the plaintext being encrypted<br>is known, and there are portions of the plaintext that the application<br>will either ignore if they are garbled or are expected to be near random<br>in the normal case (and thus for which garbled output does not cause<br>rejection by the application).&nbsp; In a SFC environment it seems highly<br>likely that the structure of the plaintext will be known or guessable,<br>and we don't have any real mechanisms to control what types of metadata<br>go into encrypted context headers, so it seems that we must act as if we<br>are exposed to this risk.<br><br>While §4.3 does have a note that use of GCM with HMAC is undesirable due<br>to the additional authentication tag, it may be unavoidable in order to<br>provide the properties that we need.<br><br>(1) Section 5.1 describes the MAC as:<br><br>&nbsp;  Message Authentication Code:&nbsp;  Covers the entire NSH data, excluding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Base header.&nbsp; The Additional Authenticated Data (defined in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>]) MUST be the Service Path header, the unencrypted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Context headers, and the inner packet on which the NSH is imposed.<br><br>This description seems to exclude from the MAC most of the MAC context<br>header itself (if we go by the corresponding figure), which is very bad<br>for security.&nbsp; We definitely need to include under the MAC the MAC<br>context header bits from metadata class through and including at least<br>timestamp, and I think IV length as well.&nbsp; (The IV itself would be<br>incorporated via the ciphertext, since the IV is an input to encryption,<br>but since the IV length field indicates whether or not encryption was<br>performed, we'd need to protect that information.)<br><br>Similarly, Section 5.2 has the description:<br><br>&nbsp;  Message Authentication Code:&nbsp; Coves the entire NSH data.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Additional Authenticated Data (defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>]) MUST be the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entire NSH data (i.e., including the Base Header) excluding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Context Headers to be encrypted.<br><br>which on the face of it includes the field that holds the MAC itself<br>(and is not yet populated), i.e., is self-referential.<br><br>I think we need to be much more precise about the construction of the<br>AAD in both cases.&nbsp; It's possible that the HMAC construction for the<br>no-encrypted-context-headers case can inherit a definition from the AAD<br>description, but if not we'll need to have some more precision there as<br>well.<br><br>(2) In order for the MAC-only construction in §7.2 to be compatible with<br>the AEAD integrity tag construction, we would need to include the 64-bit<br>AL after A.&nbsp; While HMAC is intrinsically immune to length-extension<br>attacks, I think that having the explicit AL is useful to avoid any risk<br>of malleability, since the same MAC_KEY is used for constructing both<br>types of MACs.<br><br>(3) Section 5.1 describes the Timestamp field as an "unsigned 64-bit<br>integer value", which is inconsistent with the actual format given in<br>Section 6.<br><br>(4) Section 7.5 directs the verifier to check if "the value of the newly<br>generated digest is identical to the one enclosed in the NSH".&nbsp; It is<br>critical for the security of the system that this comparison be done in<br>a constant-time manner that does not provide a side channel into whether<br>the generated digest and the value in the NSH share a common substring.<br><br>(5) Do the MAC context headers always have to be the last metadata<br>entries in the packet (to simplify the cryptographic calculations)?<br>Certainly the diagrams only show "unencrypted context headers" appearing<br>prior to the MAC context header, so if we expect unencrypted context<br>headers to appear after the MAC context header as well, we should be<br>clear about that both in the figures and in the specification for how to<br>prepare the AAD.</div></td>

It's<br>quite surprising to see "don't need to be protected" as a justification<br>for lack of encryption, rather than "need to be unprotected".&nbsp; Given<br>that we're going to be solving key distribution for integrity protection<br>anyway, it remains unclear to me why we wouldn't just encrypt<br>everything.<br><br>Section 4.1.1<br><br>Is the column heading for the middle column of Table 1 referring to the<br>Base Header and "Service Path Header"?&nbsp;

 The solution provides integrity protection for the NSH data.&nbsp; Two<br>&nbsp;  levels of assurance (LoAs) are supported.<br><br>I see (reading onward) that the two LoAs just differ in what is covered<br>by the integrity tag, but each involve only a single MAC.&nbsp; There's a<br>reasonable argument that when there are overlapping needs for what data<br>needs protecting and who needs access to it, that multiple MACs (or<br>encryption, if needed) are most appropriate, which can be tailored to<br>the respective needs.&nbsp; This is something that Phillip Hallam-Baker has<br>ascribed as the "short-blanket theory" of cryptography, in that it's<br>like a blanket that's too short to cover everything you want, so you<br>need to have more than one and put them in partially overlapping layers.<br>Perhaps this "short-blanket theory" is more applicable to Discuss point<br>(0) than what is covered by the MAC, though...<br><br>&nbsp;  The first level of assurance where all NSH data except the Base<br>&nbsp;  Header are integrity protected (Figure 2).&nbsp; In this case, the NSH<br>&nbsp;  imposer may be a Classifier, an NSH-aware SF, or an SFC Proxy.&nbsp; SFFs<br>&nbsp;  are not thus provided with authentication material.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>There seems to be a gap in the chain of reasoning as to why SFFs are not<br>provided with authentication material.&nbsp; It seems that the intent is<br>something along the lines of considering which entities need access to<br>the key material in order to successfully add an NSH or update context<br>headers, but that alone is not itself cause to say that other entities<br>can never be provided with the keys (subject to the security<br>considerations of group-shared PSKs, of course).&nbsp; Furthermore, if a<br>particular SFF is trusted, it may have grounds to verify the integrity<br>tag even if it is administratively prohibited from writing such a tag.<br><br>&nbsp;  In both levels of assurance, the unencrypted Context Headers and the<br>&nbsp;  packet on which the NSH is imposed are subject to integrity<br>&nbsp;  protection.<br><br>Surely any encrypted Context Headers are also given integrity<br>protection, as excluding them from the MAC computation would be quite<br>complex.&nbsp; I see that the encrypted context headers are not part of the<br>AAD input, but in the AEAD model the ciphertext is still given integrity<br>protection!<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The authenticated encryption algorithm defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>] is used<br>&nbsp;  to provide NSH data integrity and to encrypt the Context Headers that<br>&nbsp;  carry privacy-sensitive metadata.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC 7518</a> (JSON Web Algorithms) is a very surprising reference for<br>generic AEAD encryption.&nbsp; Continuing on, it becomes clear that we in<br>fact do not want a generic AEAD operation here, but instead have need<br>for separation of encryption and integrity protection due to the various<br>separations of roles that are possible.&nbsp; Because this is a divergence<br>from current best practices (use of native AEAD cipher modes like GCM,<br>SIV, etc.), I might suggest a rather different introductory material:<br><br>% The AEAD interface specified in <a href="/doc/rfc5116/">RFC 5116</a> is a very powerful tool for<br>% providing strong confidentiality and integrity protection for protocol<br>% messages, and has become quite widely adopted as a result.&nbsp; For<br>% protecting NSH data we adhere to the spirit of the AEAD interface but<br>% use a slightly modified version in order to remain consistent with the<br>% privilege separation needed (e.g., in the second level of assurance,<br>% SFFs need to be able to update the message integrity tag but do not<br>% need access to the decrypted plaintext).&nbsp; Accordingly, a compound AEAD<br>% mechanism combining CBC encryption and HMAC integrity tag is used, so<br>% that distribution of the encryption key can be limited.&nbsp; Rather than<br>% define a new scheme from scratch, the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 scheme from<br>% [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>] is used.&nbsp; In order to simplify key distribution, a single<br>% secret key material seed K is used, which can be kept private<br>% centrally or distributed to all parties that will have access to<br>% decrypted plaintext, and the secondary keys MAC_KEY and ENC_KEY are<br>% derived from K as discussed in Section 5.2.2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>].&nbsp; Entities<br>% that need to update the integrity tag but are not authorized to see<br>% the decrypted plaintext will only receive MAC_KEY and not K or<br>% ENC_KEY.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the Context Headers are not encrypted, the Hashed Message<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authentication Mode (HMAC) algorithm discussed in [<a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC4868</a>] is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to protect the integrity of the NSH data.<br><br>It's not clear to me that this is adding much value; HMAC is used<br>whether or not there are encrypted headers, and the <a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC 4868</a> reference<br>is rather odd (see also my Discuss point (2)).<br><br>&nbsp;  The advantage of using the authenticated encryption algorithm is that<br>&nbsp;  NSH-aware SFs and SFC proxies only need to re-compute the message<br>&nbsp;  integrity of the NSH data after decrementing the Service Index (SI)<br>&nbsp;  and do not have to re-compute the ciphertext.&nbsp; The other advantage is<br>&nbsp;  that SFFs do not have access to the ENC_KEY and cannot act on the<br>&nbsp;  encrypted Context Headers and, only in case of the second level of<br>&nbsp;  assurance, SFFs do have access to the MAC_KEY.&nbsp; Similarly, an NSH-<br>&nbsp;  aware SF or SFC Proxy not allowed to decrypt the Context Headers will<br>&nbsp;  not have access to the ENC_KEY.<br><br>[If my above suggestion is used, this text has probably become mostly<br>redundant and could be trimmed down or removed.]<br><br>&nbsp;  The authenticated encryption process takes as input four-octet<br>&nbsp;  strings: a secret key (K), a plaintext (P), Additional Authenticated<br>&nbsp;  Data (A) (which contains the data to be authenticated, but not<br>&nbsp;  encrypted), and an Initialization Vector (IV).&nbsp; The ciphertext value<br>&nbsp;  (E) and the Authentication Tag value (T) are provided as outputs.<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to decrypt and verify, the cipher takes as input K, IV, A,<br>&nbsp;  T, and E.&nbsp; The output is either the plaintext or an error indicating<br>&nbsp;  that the decryption failed as described in Section 5.2.2.2 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>].<br><br>This seems true for the abstract AEAD interface, but since we're peeling<br>off the HMAC integrity tag for standalone use, we may need to say<br>something about what inputs/outputs are needed for just using the<br>integrity tag without doing decryption.&nbsp; In particular, we cannot use K<br>as an input for standalone HMAC verification!<br><br>Also, this is just the generic AEAD interface, so <a href="/doc/rfc5116/">RFC 5116</a> is probably a<br>more apropos reference than <a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC 7518</a>.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: The use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Counter Mode (GCM) + HMAC may have CPU and packet size<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implications (need for a second 128-bit authentication tag).<br><br>[This might also be redundant if my earlier proposal is accepted.]<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The document does not assume nor preclude the following:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The same keying material is used for all the service functions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used within an SFC-enabled domain.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Distinct keying material is used per SFP by all involved SFC data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path elements.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Per-tenant keys are used.<br><br>I suggest a forward reference to the security considerations with a<br>brief note that the risk involved in using a group-shared symmetric key<br>increases with the size of the group to which it is shared.<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to accommodate deployments relying upon keying material per<br>&nbsp;  SFC/SFP and also the need to update keys after encrypting NSH data<br>&nbsp;  for a certain amount of time, this document uses key identifiers to<br>&nbsp;  unambiguously identify the appropriate keying material.&nbsp; Doing so<br>&nbsp;  allows to address the problem of synchronization of keying material.<br><br>I'd suggest making a statement about the scope in which key identifiers<br>need to be unique.<br><br>Section 4.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An NSH-aware SF or SFC Proxy that needs to decrypt some Context<br>&nbsp;  Headers uses ENC_Key and the decryption algorithm for the key<br>&nbsp;  identifier being carried in the NSH.<br><br>I think we need to say that decryption MUST NOT proceed unless the<br>integrity tag has been successfully validated.&nbsp; To decrypt without<br>checking the integrity tag violates the AEAD interface.&nbsp; Alternately, we<br>could only ever describe decryption as the AEAD operation that uses K as<br>input (not just ENC_KEY) -- §7.6 seems to attempt to take this latter<br>approach, but the document as a whole is not consistent about it.<br><br>Section 5, 5.x<br><br>I strongly suggest changing "Key Length" to "keyid length", since there<br>is already convention on "key length" (e.g., for AES-128 vs AES-192 vs<br>AES-256).<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Key Identifier:&nbsp; Carries a variable-length Key Identifier object used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to identify and deliver keys to SFC data plane elements.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; identifier is helpful to accommodate deployments relying upon<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keying material per SFC/SFP.&nbsp; The key identifier helps in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resolving the problem of synchronization of keying material.<br><br>I suggest clarifying that a single key identifier is used to lookup both<br>the associated ENC_KEY and the associated MAC_KEY (or, alternately, that<br>it is logically bound to K and remind the reader that ENC_KEY and<br>MAC_KEY are extracted from K and might be separately distributed).<br><br>&nbsp;  Key Length:&nbsp; Variable.&nbsp; Carries the length of the key identifier.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  IV Length:&nbsp; Carries the length of the IV (Section 5.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7518/">RFC7518</a>]).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If encryption is not used, IV length is set to zero (that is, no<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Initialization Vector" is included).<br><br>Please also specify that the Key/IV lengths are measured in bytes (the<br>reference for IV length, at least, talks about IVs in bits).<br><br>I strongly suggest using a value other than zero as the sentinel value<br>for "no encryption" -- there already exist modes like AES-SIV (<a href="/doc/rfc5297/">RFC 5297</a>)<br>that do not require an IV input, which would be a natural use for<br>zero-length IV.<br><br>Additionally, one might imagine using a non-zero-length IV as input to<br>an HMAC calculation as a per-message nonce.&nbsp; On cursory examination,<br>since we are already using timestamp-based replay detection, the<br>additional nonce is unlikely to add much value, but I'm not willing to<br>completely rule it out on the basis of the minimal analysis I performed.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Only one instance of "MAC and Encrypted Metadata" Context Header<br>&nbsp;  (Section 5) is allowed.&nbsp; If multiple instances of "MAC and Encrypted<br>&nbsp;  Metadata" Context Header are included in an NSH packet, the SFC data<br><br>I think Roman may have mentioned this already, but please clarify if<br>this is one instance per NSH or per packet (e.g., in hierarchical SFC we<br>might have more than one NSH in a packet).<br><br>Please also clarify it if is permitted to have both MAC#1 and MAC#2<br>present in the same packet.&nbsp; (IIUC there are not obvious situations<br>where such a setup would be useful, but it's still good to be clear<br>about expectations.)<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the Context Headers are not encrypted, the HMAC algorithm<br>&nbsp;  discussed in [<a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC4868</a>] is used to integrity protect the target NSH<br>&nbsp;  data.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's not really clear to me why <a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC 4868</a> is the right reference here, as<br>opposed to (e.g.) <a href="/doc/rfc2104/">RFC 2104</a>.&nbsp; In particular, see my Discuss point (2).<br><br>&nbsp;  The Message Authentication Code (T) computation process can be<br>&nbsp;  illustrated as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  T = HMAC-SHA-256-128(MAC_KEY, A)<br><br>I agree with the other reviewer that wondered about just using "MAC" (or<br>maybe "HMAC") rather than "HMAC-SHA-256-128" here (I do see the "can be<br>illustrated as" qualifier).<br><br>It's also a little weird to reuse T and A from the AEAD construction (or<br><a href="/doc/rfc4868/">RFC 4868</a>) here without additional discussion on how they apply and how<br>the value of A is constructed.<br><br>&nbsp;  An entity in the SFP that intends to update the NSH MUST follow the<br>&nbsp;  above behavior to maintain message integrity of the NSH for<br>&nbsp;  subsequent validations.<br><br>I'm not sure that "intends to" is needed; the requirement applies to<br>actions, not intent.<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  In an SFC-enabled domain where pervasive monitoring [<a href="/doc/rfc7258/">RFC7258</a>] is<br>&nbsp;  possible, all Context Headers carrying privacy-sensitive metadata<br>&nbsp;

 The received NSH is accepted by an NSH-aware node if the Timestamp<br>&nbsp;  (TS) in the NSH is recent enough to the reception time of the NSH<br>&nbsp;  (TSrt).&nbsp; The following formula is used for this check:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  -Delta &lt; (TSrt - TS) &lt; +Delta<br><br>(There's no real reason why the accepted timestamp skew parameter Delta<br>needs to be symmetric in the positive and negative directions.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Replay attacks within the Delta window may be detected by an NSH-<br>&nbsp;  aware node by recording a unique value derived, for example, from the<br>&nbsp;  NSH data and Original packet (e.g., using SHA2).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Note that the unique value MUST NOT use as input any bits that are not<br>covered by the MAC.&nbsp; Indeed, just using the MAC itself as the unique<br>value would be a fairly straightforward scheme, I think.<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>&nbsp;  When an SFC data plane element receives an NSH packet, it MUST first<br>&nbsp;  ensure that a "MAC and Encrypted Metadata" Context Header is<br>&nbsp;  included.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This sort of requirement (as written) would seem to support the position<br>of some other reviewers that this document would need to formally update<br><a href="/doc/rfc8300/">RFC 8300</a>.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>We might discuss that this mechanism is only for metadata type 2 and not<br>type 1 (as well as that with the relatively small fixed length of type 1<br>metadata, it's quite challenging to provide useful cryptographic<br>protection), so that type-1 metadata still has no generic protection<br>mechanism.&nbsp; A given metadata element could define its own protection<br>scheme, of course.<br><br>&nbsp;  The attacks discussed in [<a href="/doc/draft-nguyen-sfc-security-architecture/">I-D.nguyen-sfc-security-architecture</a>] are<br>&nbsp;

I am not sure that this document<br>on its own suffices to prevent the middlebox-bypass attack for all<br>traffic (i.e., the probe-based scheme might still be needed).&nbsp; If some<br>network entities know what the expected service index will be for a<br>given SPI at a given node, then middlebox-bypass attacks could be<br>natively detected, but my understanding was that such advance knowledge<br>of expected service index was not going to be available.<br><br>&nbsp;

Because<br>&nbsp;  of the proliferation of such advanced SFs together with complex<br>&nbsp;  service deployment constraints that demand more agile service<br>&nbsp;  delivery procedures, operators need to rationalize their service<br>&nbsp;  delivery logics and master their complexity while optimising service<br>&nbsp;  activation time cycles.&nbsp; The overall problem space is described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7498/">RFC7498</a>].<br><br>The "their" in "master their complexity" is a bit ambiguous between<br>"operators" and "service delivery logics" (noting that the previous use<br>of "their" did refer to "operators").&nbsp; (The sentence as a whole reads a<br>bit like marketing language, but that's not intended to be an actionable<br>comment.)<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification fills that gap.&nbsp; Concretely, this document adds<br>&nbsp;  integrity protection and optional encryption of sensitive metadata<br>&nbsp;  directly to the NSH (Section 4); integrity protects the packet<br>&nbsp;  payload and provides replay protection (Section 7.4).&nbsp;
