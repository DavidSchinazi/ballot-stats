As I read the document I find it difficult to understand why the bit carries extra value for the receiver.

Or did I misunderstand this?<br><br>Also, it would be useful to specify what information must be understood in the network for the A bit usage. Do all nodes have to the same understanding of the threshold throughout the network? Or just the sending node?<br><br>Finally, I would have preferred to see some defaults for the various configurable values, and some discussion of the requirements for the values. Again, do the measurement period for instance have to be aligned across a network, or not? A section on management considerations might be appropriate.</div></td>
