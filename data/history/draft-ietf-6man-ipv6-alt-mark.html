In §2.1.1 we have,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) is most likely to be the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; starting or ending node since it connects the user's premises with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the service provider's network and therefore belongs to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operator's controlled domain.&nbsp; Typically the CPE encapsulates a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; received packet in an outer IPv6 header which contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alternate Marking data.&nbsp; The CPE can also be able to filter and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drop packets from outside of the domain with inconsistent fields<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to make effective the relevant security rules at the domain<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boundaries, for example a simple security check can be to insert<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Alternate Marking data if and only if the destination is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; within the controlled domain.<br><br>A remark -- I was surprised to see that the CPE is considered by the authors to be within the operator's security perimeter. Even if the operator manages the CPE (not a given), the CPE isn't physically secure, so I would assume it can't be considered to be as trustworthy as equipment kept on the operator's premise.<br><br>And, a question -- since in this paragraph you suggest that the controlled domain perimeter terminates prior to the user equipment, I read your final clause ("...destination is within the controlled domain") to mean that Alt-Mark wouldn't be usable for any traffic destined for user equipment. Thus the applicability would be limited to network management traffic, or overlay traffic that will be decapsulated somewhere within the operator network (perhaps at a CPE collocated with the user equipment which is the true destination). Is that accurate? If not, what am I missing?<br><br>I guess it's overlay traffic, since as you also point out, only the source node is allowed to insert the Option Header -- and for the CPE to be the source node, it has to be doing an encapsulation operation. Right?<br><br>(If the user equipment could be the destination, then the "simple security check" might not be so simple, depending on whether the user premise addressing comes from provider space or the user's own space.)<br><br><br>4. You mention in §4 and elsewhere that the Destination Option version of the Alt-Mark can be processed by each node in the route list if there's a Routing Header present:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Destination Option preceding a Routing Header =&gt; every destination<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node in the route list.<br><br>Suppose some flavor of segment list compression is in use, such as the <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression/">draft-ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression</a> NEXT-C-SID "flavor". In some cases (when the SID list is short enough and the compression tight enough) can't you have a packet that contains a SID list that's expressed entirely in what conventional IPv6 would call the "destination address", and no Routing Header is present? <br><br>What would the expected processing of the Alt-Mark Destination Option be in that case?<br><br><br>5. In §2 you have<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Furthermore, since the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Label is pseudo-random, there is always a finite probability of<br>&nbsp;  collision.&nbsp; Those reasons make the definition of the FlowMonID<br>&nbsp;  necessary for IPv6.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This objection to the pseudo-randomness of the flow label seemed OK, until I came to the definition of FlowMonID, which you define as... pseudo-random, and you later talk about its possibility of collision. Maybe you should remove the "furthermore" sentence, since apparently you don't have any objection to collisions after all?<br><br>(I return to the question of the FlowMonID later on in this review.)<br><br><br>6. In §4 you have<br><br>&nbsp;  The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take<br>&nbsp;  advantage of the property of how Hop-by-Hop options are processed.<br>&nbsp;  Nodes that do not support this Option SHOULD ignore them.<br><br>This doesn't seem to be written quite right. If you're just stating an expectation, based on the requirements from <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, then you're not introducing a new requirement, and you shouldn't have the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword there. It's also not obvious what the referent of "them" is. Do you perhaps mean something like this?<br><br>&nbsp;  The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take<br>&nbsp;  advantage of the property of how Hop-by-Hop options are processed.<br>&nbsp;  Nodes that do not support this Option would be expected to ignore <br>&nbsp;  it if encountered, according to the procedures of [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>].<br><br>In general the paragraph that includes this sentence is repetitive, so you could also just remove the sentence and do a little re-wording -- but at least a rewrite to remove the SHOULD is necessary.<br><br><br>7. In §5.1 you say,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where B<br>&nbsp;  is the fixed time duration of the batch, which refers to the original<br>&nbsp;  marking interval at the source node considering that this interval<br>&nbsp;  could fluctuate along the path.<br><br>How can the interval fluctuate, considering that you've taken pains to point out that only the source node is able to mark the packets?<br><br>Perhaps you mean that as the packets that make up the batch traverse the network, their spacing would be expected to jitter based on network conditions, and therefore at any point in the network other than the source, the observed time duration might be different. If you think that is really important to state, I think you need to write it out in more detail, although to me it doesn't seem to be of the essence, so I would suggest just removing "considering that this interval could fluctuate along the path" -- you've already made it clear by saying it's the interval *at the source node*.<br><br><br>8. I'm curious why you require that the FlowMonID is set pseudo-randomly. (By the way I assume a true random value would also be acceptable!) Assuming the implementation follows this:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In particular,<br>&nbsp;  it is RECOMMENDED to consider the 3-tuple FlowMonID, source and<br>&nbsp;  destination addresses:<br><br>Then why wouldn't it be superior for the source node to produce the FlowMonID by using a counter that it increments by one for each subsequent flow? The source node could keep such a counter globally, or per destination, depending on expectations of number of flows. I suppose you might be trying to keep the process stateless, except that you've already given up on statelessness by allowing for a central controller to assign FlowMonIDs.<br><br>Also it's surprising to me that it's considered reasonable to involve a central controller in choosing a FlowMonID per flow. It seems intuitively obvious that this would be unscalable and/or introduce unacceptable latency unless there are notably few flows in the network, and/or the flows are very long-lived. (I guess this could be the case if a "flow" is all the packets exchanged by a given ingress and egress pair of CE routers, but if that's an anticipated case it's not explained in the document.)<br><br><br>9. I don't really understand §5.4 and would rather not take the time to read <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis/">draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis</a> in detail to get the necessary background. I *think* when this section talks about clusters, these are a measurement strategy and there's no marking that takes place at a cluster border -- correct? <br><br>Also, in this paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp;  The Cluster is the smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire<br>&nbsp;  Network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of<br>&nbsp;  packets that goes in is the same that goes out.&nbsp; With network<br>&nbsp;  clustering, it is possible to use the partition of the network into<br>&nbsp;  clusters at different levels in order to perform the needed degree of<br>&nbsp;  detail.&nbsp; So, for Multipoint Alternate Marking, FlowMonID can identify<br>&nbsp;  in general a multipoint-to-multipoint flow and not only a point-to-<br>&nbsp;  point flow.<br><br>The final sentence starts with "so," which implies that the final sentence causally follows from the previous sentences. While the statement may well be true as far as I know, the previous sentences aren't enough to motivate it. I think dropping the "so" would be enough to fix this, and then the curious reader could go review <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis/">draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis</a> carefully to understand the reasons.<br><br>A second question related to this paragraph, if the Cluster is the "*smallest* identifiable subnetwork", etc, doesn't that mean a Cluster is always an individual router? Might you actually mean the *largest* identifiable subnetwork that satisfies the property?<br><br><br>10. In §6 you say,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Alternate Marking implies<br>&nbsp;  modifications on the fly to an Option Header of IPv6 packets by the<br>&nbsp;  source node<br><br>I am surprised by this. My impression (elaborated in some of my earlier questions) was that Option Headers would only be inserted by the packet's source, per the requirements of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>. You also take pains to say that (§2),<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The intermediate nodes and destination node MUST only<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; read the marking values of the option without modifying the Option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Header.<br><br>What, then, are these "modifications on the fly"?<br><br><br>11. Later in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As<br>&nbsp;  already discussed in Section 4, it is RECOMMENDED that the AltMark<br>&nbsp;  Option does not affect the throughput and therefore the user<br>&nbsp;  experience.<br><br>Placing requirements on router performance characteristics seems like overreach, to say the least -- and indeed, Section 4 doesn't do this, it takes the more sensible approach of explaining why the chosen design is expected to be implementable without adversely affecting performance. Perhaps reword something like,<br><br>&nbsp;  As is discussed in Section 4, the design of the AltMark Option has<br>&nbsp;  been chosen with throughput in mind, such that it can be implemented<br>&nbsp;  without affecting the user experience.<br><br><br>12. Again in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In this case, nodes outside the domain MUST simply ignore<br>&nbsp;  packets with AltMark Option since they are not configured to handle<br>&nbsp;  it and should not process it.<br><br>I don't think you can make that statement with confidence -- what if domain A adjoins a different domain B which also uses AltMark within its own boundaries? In such a case, domain B would indeed be configured to handle it.<br><br>In such a case you would need a double-fault in containment to have a problem, though -- domain A would have to allow outbound leakage, and domain B would have to allow inbound leakage. But the statement as you've written it seems wrong.<br><br>In addition to the above, I don't see how you can impose requirements on nodes outside the domain (your use of the keyword "MUST"). After all, the nodes outside the domain might not implement ipv6-alt-mark at all. I think the keyword "MUST" is out of place here.<br><br><br>NITS:<br><br>13. In §4,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A new type of<br>&nbsp;  Routing Header, referred as Segment Routing Header (SRH), has been<br>&nbsp;  defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] for SRv6.<br>&nbsp;  <br>It isn't really so new, <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> is more than two years old now. In general I suggest reviewing the use of "new" when publishing any RFC, and considering whether it will stand the test of time -- when a reader considers your document in ten years, will "new" still make sense?<br><br><br>14. In §5.1,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this way each marked packet can<br>&nbsp;  be assigned to the right batch by each node.&nbsp; Usually the counters<br>&nbsp;  can be taken in the middle of the batch period to be sure to take<br>&nbsp;  still counters.<br>&nbsp;  <br>When you say "still counters" do you mean "still" in the sense of "unmoving, quiescent"? I suggest "quiescent" would be less ambiguous in that case, and maybe "read" instead of "take" -- so "read quiescent counters".<br><br><br>15. In §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  so the only effect is the increased MTU<br>&nbsp;  <br>It isn't the MTU that's increased, it's the packet size.<br><br><br>16. In §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  The flow identifier (FlowMonID) composes the AltMark Option together<br>&nbsp;  with the two marking bits (L and D).<br>&nbsp;  <br>No it doesn't, taken in this context the most obvious reading of "composes" is as a synonym for "concatenates", and it doesn't do that. Probably what you mean is this?<br><br>&nbsp;  The flow identifier (FlowMonID), together with the two marking bits <br>&nbsp;  (L and D), comprises the AltMark Option.<br><br>17. And immediately following, still in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As explained in Section 5.3,<br>&nbsp;  there is a chance of collision if the FlowMonID is set pseudo<br>&nbsp;  randomly and a solution exists.<br><br>That seems wrong. I think you've spliced incorrectly with that final "and"? Maybe you're saying that there's a chance of collision, but that there is a mitigation ("a solution") available for this problem? <br><br><br>18. Again in §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, it is to be noted that the AltMark Option is carried by<br>&nbsp;  the Options Header and it may have some impact on the packet sizes<br>&nbsp;  <br>"Will have", not "may have".</div></td>

In §2.1.1 we have,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) is most likely to be the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; starting or ending node since it connects the user's premises with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the service provider's network and therefore belongs to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operator's controlled domain.&nbsp; Typically the CPE encapsulates a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; received packet in an outer IPv6 header which contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alternate Marking data.&nbsp; The CPE can also be able to filter and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drop packets from outside of the domain with inconsistent fields<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to make effective the relevant security rules at the domain<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boundaries, for example a simple security check can be to insert<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Alternate Marking data if and only if the destination is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; within the controlled domain.<br><br>A remark -- I was surprised to see that the CPE is considered by the authors to be within the operator's security perimeter. Even if the operator manages the CPE (not a given), the CPE isn't physically secure, so I would assume it can't be considered to be as trustworthy as equipment kept on the operator's premise.<br><br>And, a question -- since in this paragraph you suggest that the controlled domain perimeter terminates prior to the user equipment, I read your final clause ("...destination is within the controlled domain") to mean that Alt-Mark wouldn't be usable for any traffic destined for user equipment. Thus the applicability would be limited to network management traffic, or overlay traffic that will be decapsulated somewhere within the operator network (perhaps at a CPE collocated with the user equipment which is the true destination). Is that accurate? If not, what am I missing?<br><br>I guess it's overlay traffic, since as you also point out, only the source node is allowed to insert the Option Header -- and for the CPE to be the source node, it has to be doing an encapsulation operation. Right?<br><br>(If the user equipment could be the destination, then the "simple security check" might not be so simple, depending on whether the user premise addressing comes from provider space or the user's own space.)<br><br><br>4. You mention in §4 and elsewhere that the Destination Option version of the Alt-Mark can be processed by each node in the route list if there's a Routing Header present:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Destination Option preceding a Routing Header =&gt; every destination<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node in the route list.<br><br>Suppose some flavor of segment list compression is in use, such as the <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression/">draft-ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression</a> NEXT-C-SID "flavor". In some cases (when the SID list is short enough and the compression tight enough) can't you have a packet that contains a SID list that's expressed entirely in what conventional IPv6 would call the "destination address", and no Routing Header is present? <br><br>What would the expected processing of the Alt-Mark Destination Option be in that case?<br><br><br>5. In §2 you have<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Furthermore, since the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Label is pseudo-random, there is always a finite probability of<br>&nbsp;  collision.&nbsp; Those reasons make the definition of the FlowMonID<br>&nbsp;  necessary for IPv6.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This objection to the pseudo-randomness of the flow label seemed OK, until I came to the definition of FlowMonID, which you define as... pseudo-random, and you later talk about its possibility of collision. Maybe you should remove the "furthermore" sentence, since apparently you don't have any objection to collisions after all?<br><br>(I return to the question of the FlowMonID later on in this review.)<br><br><br>6. In §4 you have<br><br>&nbsp;  The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take<br>&nbsp;  advantage of the property of how Hop-by-Hop options are processed.<br>&nbsp;  Nodes that do not support this Option SHOULD ignore them.<br><br>This doesn't seem to be written quite right. If you're just stating an expectation, based on the requirements from <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, then you're not introducing a new requirement, and you shouldn't have the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword there. It's also not obvious what the referent of "them" is. Do you perhaps mean something like this?<br><br>&nbsp;  The Hop-by-Hop Option defined in this document is designed to take<br>&nbsp;  advantage of the property of how Hop-by-Hop options are processed.<br>&nbsp;  Nodes that do not support this Option would be expected to ignore <br>&nbsp;  it if encountered, according to the procedures of [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>].<br><br>In general the paragraph that includes this sentence is repetitive, so you could also just remove the sentence and do a little re-wording -- but at least a rewrite to remove the SHOULD is necessary.<br><br><br>7. In §5.1 you say,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where B<br>&nbsp;  is the fixed time duration of the batch, which refers to the original<br>&nbsp;  marking interval at the source node considering that this interval<br>&nbsp;  could fluctuate along the path.<br><br>How can the interval fluctuate, considering that you've taken pains to point out that only the source node is able to mark the packets?<br><br>Perhaps you mean that as the packets that make up the batch traverse the network, their spacing would be expected to jitter based on network conditions, and therefore at any point in the network other than the source, the observed time duration might be different. If you think that is really important to state, I think you need to write it out in more detail, although to me it doesn't seem to be of the essence, so I would suggest just removing "considering that this interval could fluctuate along the path" -- you've already made it clear by saying it's the interval *at the source node*.<br><br><br>8. I'm curious why you require that the FlowMonID is set pseudo-randomly. (By the way I assume a true random value would also be acceptable!) Assuming the implementation follows this:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In particular,<br>&nbsp;  it is RECOMMENDED to consider the 3-tuple FlowMonID, source and<br>&nbsp;  destination addresses:<br><br>Then why wouldn't it be superior for the source node to produce the FlowMonID by using a counter that it increments by one for each subsequent flow? The source node could keep such a counter globally, or per destination, depending on expectations of number of flows. I suppose you might be trying to keep the process stateless, except that you've already given up on statelessness by allowing for a central controller to assign FlowMonIDs.<br><br>Also it's surprising to me that it's considered reasonable to involve a central controller in choosing a FlowMonID per flow. It seems intuitively obvious that this would be unscalable and/or introduce unacceptable latency unless there are notably few flows in the network, and/or the flows are very long-lived. (I guess this could be the case if a "flow" is all the packets exchanged by a given ingress and egress pair of CE routers, but if that's an anticipated case it's not explained in the document.)<br><br><br>9. I don't really understand §5.4 and would rather not take the time to read <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis/">draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis</a> in detail to get the necessary background. I *think* when this section talks about clusters, these are a measurement strategy and there's no marking that takes place at a cluster border -- correct? <br><br>Also, in this paragraph,<br><br>&nbsp;  The Cluster is the smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire<br>&nbsp;  Network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of<br>&nbsp;  packets that goes in is the same that goes out.&nbsp; With network<br>&nbsp;  clustering, it is possible to use the partition of the network into<br>&nbsp;  clusters at different levels in order to perform the needed degree of<br>&nbsp;  detail.&nbsp; So, for Multipoint Alternate Marking, FlowMonID can identify<br>&nbsp;  in general a multipoint-to-multipoint flow and not only a point-to-<br>&nbsp;  point flow.<br><br>The final sentence starts with "so," which implies that the final sentence causally follows from the previous sentences. While the statement may well be true as far as I know, the previous sentences aren't enough to motivate it. I think dropping the "so" would be enough to fix this, and then the curious reader could go review <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis/">draft-ietf-ippm-rfc8889bis</a> carefully to understand the reasons.<br><br>A second question related to this paragraph, if the Cluster is the "*smallest* identifiable subnetwork", etc, doesn't that mean a Cluster is always an individual router? Might you actually mean the *largest* identifiable subnetwork that satisfies the property?<br><br><br>10. In §6 you say,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Alternate Marking implies<br>&nbsp;  modifications on the fly to an Option Header of IPv6 packets by the<br>&nbsp;  source node<br><br>I am surprised by this. My impression (elaborated in some of my earlier questions) was that Option Headers would only be inserted by the packet's source, per the requirements of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>. You also take pains to say that (§2),<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The intermediate nodes and destination node MUST only<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; read the marking values of the option without modifying the Option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Header.<br><br>What, then, are these "modifications on the fly"?<br><br><br>11. Later in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As<br>&nbsp;  already discussed in Section 4, it is RECOMMENDED that the AltMark<br>&nbsp;  Option does not affect the throughput and therefore the user<br>&nbsp;  experience.<br><br>Placing requirements on router performance characteristics seems like overreach, to say the least -- and indeed, Section 4 doesn't do this, it takes the more sensible approach of explaining why the chosen design is expected to be implementable without adversely affecting performance. Perhaps reword something like,<br><br>&nbsp;  As is discussed in Section 4, the design of the AltMark Option has<br>&nbsp;  been chosen with throughput in mind, such that it can be implemented<br>&nbsp;  without affecting the user experience.<br><br><br>12. Again in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In this case, nodes outside the domain MUST simply ignore<br>&nbsp;  packets with AltMark Option since they are not configured to handle<br>&nbsp;  it and should not process it.<br><br>I don't think you can make that statement with confidence -- what if domain A adjoins a different domain B which also uses AltMark within its own boundaries? In such a case, domain B would indeed be configured to handle it.<br><br>In such a case you would need a double-fault in containment to have a problem, though -- domain A would have to allow outbound leakage, and domain B would have to allow inbound leakage. But the statement as you've written it seems wrong.<br><br>In addition to the above, I don't see how you can impose requirements on nodes outside the domain (your use of the keyword "MUST"). After all, the nodes outside the domain might not implement ipv6-alt-mark at all. I think the keyword "MUST" is out of place here.<br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>13. In §4,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A new type of<br>&nbsp;  Routing Header, referred as Segment Routing Header (SRH), has been<br>&nbsp;  defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] for SRv6.<br>&nbsp;  <br>It isn't really so new, <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> is more than two years old now. In general I suggest reviewing the use of "new" when publishing any RFC, and considering whether it will stand the test of time -- when a reader considers your document in ten years, will "new" still make sense?<br><br><br>14. In §5.1,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this way each marked packet can<br>&nbsp;  be assigned to the right batch by each node.&nbsp; Usually the counters<br>&nbsp;  can be taken in the middle of the batch period to be sure to take<br>&nbsp;  still counters.<br>&nbsp;  <br>When you say "still counters" do you mean "still" in the sense of "unmoving, quiescent"? I suggest "quiescent" would be less ambiguous in that case, and maybe "read" instead of "take" -- so "read quiescent counters".<br><br><br>15. In §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  so the only effect is the increased MTU<br>&nbsp;  <br>It isn't the MTU that's increased, it's the packet size.<br><br><br>16. In §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  The flow identifier (FlowMonID) composes the AltMark Option together<br>&nbsp;  with the two marking bits (L and D).<br>&nbsp;  <br>No it doesn't, taken in this context the most obvious reading of "composes" is as a synonym for "concatenates", and it doesn't do that. Probably what you mean is this?<br><br>&nbsp;  The flow identifier (FlowMonID), together with the two marking bits <br>&nbsp;  (L and D), comprises the AltMark Option.<br><br>17. And immediately following, still in §6,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As explained in Section 5.3,<br>&nbsp;  there is a chance of collision if the FlowMonID is set pseudo<br>&nbsp;  randomly and a solution exists.<br><br>That seems wrong. I think you've spliced incorrectly with that final "and"? Maybe you're saying that there's a chance of collision, but that there is a mitigation ("a solution") available for this problem? <br><br><br>18. Again in §6,<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, it is to be noted that the AltMark Option is carried by<br>&nbsp;  the Options Header and it may have some impact on the packet sizes<br>&nbsp;  <br>"Will have", not "may have".</div></td>

Extension headers are usually not presented / used by upper layers anyway.<br><br>-- generic --<br>This discussion already happened in the 6MAN WG but I still have to be convinced that hop-by-hop is a good idea at all. The fate of packets with HbH is unknown at best and, IMHO, this is a wrong use of HbH because the forwarding/processing of packets is NOT influenced at all by the AltMark option. What is required is a simple 'marking/coloring', which could be at any place in a packet (including destination option). The only benefit of HbH is its location just after the IPv6 header.<br><br>After all, existing devices can measure and generate IPFIX records in hardware/fastpath by inspecting at the bare minimum the 5-tuple and many devices can also parse extension headers in the fast path (of course not processing HbH in this case). I.e., finding the marking in the Dest Option is probably much easier and doable in current hardware rather than using HbH as HbH forces a software processing.<br><br>--- PREVIOUS COMMENT (for archive) ---<br><br>-- Section 2.1 --<br>While I agree with my fellow AD about the inconsistencies of the text around 'limited domain' (and being inconsistent deserves a blocking DISCUSS), I do not agree with this section as I do not see any harm to extend this marking outside of a single domain, marked packets with this specification can traverse the whole Internet without causing any harm and not opening for any attack on the transit nodes. (See also my point about Hop-by-hop)<br><br>E.g., packets from organisation A can traverse networks of organizations B, C, ..., Z to reach another site of organization A and still provide useful measurements for A without causing harm to B, C, ..., Z. Of course the survivability of those marked packets is not guaranteed.<br><br>-- Section 3.1 --<br>Is there any reason why the FlowMonID is 20 bit long ? Exactly as the 20-bit Flow Label of the IPv6 header... See my comments for section 5.3<br><br>s/Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on receipt./Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on processing./ as the option should be processed not only by the destination node.<br><br>-- Section 5 --<br>This section (in a standard track I-D) repeats many things from experimental RFCs... This is really confusing and, while I am usually not dogmatic, I support my fellow AD on this point.<br><br>Moreover, repeating contents from other docs can only introduce inconsistencies among docs =&gt; suggest to remove section 5.1 and 5.2.<br><br>-- Section 5.3 --<br>The general reasons of using a 20-bit FlowMonID appear quite weak to me with the risk of collision being very high, e.g., in a DC with thousands of VM and millions of containers there will be collisions rendering this field useless. Strongly suggest to make its use optional</div></td>

The fate of packets with HbH is unknown at best and, IMHO, this is a wrong use of HbH because the forwarding/processing of packets is NOT influenced at all by the AltMark option. What is required is a simple 'marking/coloring', which could be at any place in a packet (including destination option). The only benefit of HbH is its location just after the IPv6 header.<br><br>After all, existing devices can measure and generate IPFIX records in hardware/fastpath by inspecting at the bare minimum the 5-tuple and many devices can also parse extension headers in the fast path (of course not processing HbH in this case). I.e., finding the marking in the Dest Option is probably much easier and doable in current hardware rather than using HbH as HbH forces a software processing.<br><br>--- END OF OLD DISCUSS ---<br><br>-- Section 2.1 --<br>While I agree with my fellow AD about the inconsistencies of the text around 'limited domain' (and being inconsistent deserves a blocking DISCUSS), I do not agree with this section as I do not see any harm to extend this marking outside of a single domain, marked packets with this specification can traverse the whole Internet without causing any harm and not opening for any attack on the transit nodes. (See also my point about Hop-by-hop)<br><br>E.g., packets from organisation A can traverse networks of organizations B, C, ..., Z to reach another site of organization A and still provide useful measurements for A without causing harm to B, C, ..., Z. Of course the survivability of those marked packets is not guaranteed.<br><br>-- Section 3.1 --<br>Is there any reason why the FlowMonID is 20 bit long ? Exactly as the 20-bit Flow Label of the IPv6 header... See my comments for section 5.3<br><br>s/Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on receipt./Unrecognized Types MUST be ignored on processing./ as the option should be processed not only by the destination node.<br><br>-- Section 5 --<br>This section (in a standard track I-D) repeats many things from experimental RFCs... This is really confusing and, while I am usually not dogmatic, I support my fellow AD on this point.<br><br>Moreover, repeating contents from other docs can only introduce inconsistencies among docs =&gt; suggest to remove section 5.1 and 5.2.<br><br>-- Section 5.3 --<br>The general reasons of using a 20-bit FlowMonID appear quite weak to me with the risk of collision being very high, e.g., in a DC with thousands of VM and millions of containers there will be collisions rendering this field useless.

 In summary the approach with double marking is better than the<br>&nbsp;  approach with single marking.&nbsp; Moreover the two approaches can also<br>&nbsp;  be combined to have even more information and statistics on delay.<br><br>It might be worth saying a little more about how the approaches can be<br>"combined"; my current understanding seems more like they are both<br>executed in parallel on the same input data, but they produce<br>independent result values and any combination of those results is left<br>to the system (or human) processing the results.<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; First, it helps to reduce the per node configuration.&nbsp; Otherwise,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each node needs to configure an access-control list (ACL) for each<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the monitored flows.&nbsp; Moreover, using a flow identifier allows<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a flexible granularity for the flow definition.<br><br>This seems to only be relevant in the case where there is definitely a<br>central controller involved, if I'm understanding correctly -- if the<br>source is assigning the FlowMonIDs the consumers will still need to look<br>for those flows by ACL.&nbsp; So maybe this could be rephrased slightly to<br>account for that.<br><br>Section 5.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  of collision for 1206 flows.&nbsp; So, for more entropy, FlowMonID can<br>&nbsp;  either be combined with other identifying flow information in a<br>&nbsp;  packet (e.g. it is possible to consider the hashed 3-tuple Flow<br>&nbsp;  Label, Source and Destination addresses) or the FlowMonID size could<br>&nbsp;  be increased.<br><br>This document is about to become a final, standards-track, RFC.&nbsp; I<br>strongly suggest removing discussion of things that are not possible<br>once the protocol becomes immortalized in an RFC (that is, increasing<br>the FlowMonID size).<br><br>Section 6<br><br>Thank you for putting so much effort into the security considerations<br>section already!&nbsp; I have a few thoughts on potential additional topics<br>to consider.<br><br>Not necessarily something that needs to be discussed in the security<br>considerations section itself, but the security considerations in<br>practice will depend on whether the marking is always enabled for all<br>flows, always enabled for a subset of flows, only enabled for specific<br>flows on-demand, etc..&nbsp; Some kind of scope-setting for the expected<br>usage could be helpful to see, since the expected usage shapes what<br>analysis has been done of the security properties.<br><br>Separately, it is perhaps too banal to mention, but attacks on the<br>reporting/consolidation of the statistics between the monitoring devices<br>and the analysis platform can interfere with the proper functioning of<br>the system.&nbsp; The channels used to report back flow statistics should be<br>secured.<br><br>There are also some considerations to note when the FlowMonIDs are<br>centrally allocated by a controller -- the controller knows a lot about<br>what traffic is flowing!&nbsp; That might make it the target of an attack,<br>depending on the attacker goals.<br><br>Another factor that comes into play when the controller (or anyone,<br>really) is non-randomly assigning IDs, is that the actual structure of<br>the ID allocation itself can cause issues -- for example, predictable<br>sequential assignment can give an attacker insight into the rate of flow<br>creation, what fraction of flows they have visibility into from their<br>current vantage point, and makes attacks that are contingent on guessing<br>the "next" identifier very feasible.&nbsp; The considerations in<br><a href="/doc/draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations/">draft-gont-numeric-ids-sec-considerations</a> seem to apply.<br><br>&nbsp;  Harm caused by the measurement: Alternate Marking implies<br><br>I think Roman already touched on this to some extent, but the FlowMonID<br>in the measurement option adds some privacy considerations that can in<br>some cases mean that the measurement causes harm.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; single monitoring point.&nbsp; The only way for an attacker can be to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; eavesdrop on multiple monitoring points at the same time, because<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; they have to do the same kind of calculation and aggregation as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alternate Marking requires, and, after that, it can finally gain<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; information about the network performance, but this is not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; immediate.<br><br>Just my own opinion, but I think this would be more useful if it stopped<br>after "have to do the same kind of calculation and aggregation as<br>Alternate Marking requires."&nbsp; That is, the attacker doesn't have an<br>advantage over the rightful admin, but can get the same data; we don't<br>need to say anything more, and the mention of "not immediate" is<br>arguably misleading.<br><br>&nbsp;  Furthermore, in a pervasive surveillance attack, the information that<br>&nbsp;  can be derived over time is more.&nbsp; But the application of the<br>&nbsp;  Alternate Marking to a controlled domain helps to mitigate all the<br>&nbsp;  above aspects of privacy concerns.<br><br>I suggest adding another clause or sentence about why/how the controlled<br>domain mitigates the privacy concerns (perhaps just as a forward<br>reference to the text currently two paragraphs later than this one,<br>which might be easier to achieve if the security considerations were<br>split into subsections).<br><br>&nbsp;  this document.&nbsp; As an example, the AltMark Option can be used as Hop-<br>&nbsp;  by-Hop or Destination Option and, in case of Destination Option,<br>&nbsp;  multiple domains may be traversed by the AltMark Option that is not<br>&nbsp;  confined to a single domain.&nbsp; In this case, the user, aware of the<br><br>(This statement might be added to the list that Roman enumerated of<br>places where we do/don't talk about being confined to a limited domain.)<br><br>&nbsp;  confined to a single domain.&nbsp; In this case, the user, aware of the<br>&nbsp;  kind of risks, may still want to use Alternate Marking for telemetry<br>&nbsp;  and test purposes but the inter-domain links need to be secured<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., by IPsec) in order to avoid external threats.&nbsp; For these<br><br>(Interesting that here IPsec is only an "e.g." and not a MUST...even<br>though the "MUST" is repeated in the following sentence!&nbsp; C.f. my remark<br>on Section 2.1.)<br><br>&nbsp;  measurement.&nbsp; A detailed discussion about the threats against time<br>&nbsp;  protocols and how to mitigate them is presented in [<a href="/doc/rfc7384/">RFC7384</a>].&nbsp; Also,<br><br>NTS was recently published as <a href="/doc/rfc8915/">RFC 8915</a>; it might be worth mentioning<br>here.<br><br>Section 9.2<br><br>It's not really clear to me that RFCs 8321 and 8889 can be classified as<br>informative.<br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The Alternate Marking is an on-path telemetry technique and consists<br>&nbsp;  in synchronizing the measurements in different points of a network by<br>&nbsp;  switching the value of a marking bit and therefore divide the packet<br>&nbsp;  flow into batches.&nbsp; Each batch represents a measurable entity<br><br>s/divide/dividing/, to match up with the conjugation of "synchronizing"<br>and "switching".<br><br>&nbsp;  unambiguously recognizable by all network nodes along the path.&nbsp; By<br><br>I think that "unambiguously" can fail in the face of extreme reording<br>(relative to the marking window).<br><br>&nbsp;  in an IPv6 domain is reported in Section 6.&nbsp; As for all the on-path<br>&nbsp;  telemetry technique, the only definitive solution is that this<br><br>s/all the on-path telemetry technique/all on-path telemetry techniques/<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  Hop-by-Hop Option Header is also useful to signal to routers on the<br>&nbsp;  path to process the Alternate Marking.&nbsp; However, as said, routers<br>&nbsp;  will examine this option if properly configured.<br><br>I think that "only" should be added, either for "will only examine" or<br>"only if properly configured" (but not both).<br><br>&nbsp;  Furthermore the Flow Label may be changed en route and this may also<br>&nbsp;  violate the measurement task.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>"violate the measurement task" is an unusual phrasing, and I'm not<br>actually sure what meaning it's intended to convey.&nbsp; Perhaps it's<br>something about invalidating the integrity of the measurement result?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  In general, it is needed to perform both end to end and hop by hop<br>&nbsp;  measurements, and the Alternate Marking methodology allows, by<br>&nbsp;  definition, both performance measurements.&nbsp; But, in many cases the<br>&nbsp;  end-to-end measurement is not enough and it is required also the hop-<br>&nbsp;  by-hop measurement, so the most complete choice is the Hop-by-Hop<br>&nbsp;  Options Header.<br><br>The paragraph structure here doesn't make much sense: we say that in<br>general, both (end-to-end and hop-by-hop) measurements are possible, but<br>then follow up with a note that "in many cases end-to-end is not<br>enough".&nbsp; There's no previous situation described where only end-to-end<br>is possible that merits this comparison.&nbsp; It seems that some specific<br>mention of Destination Options would be needed in order to be able to<br>make such a comparison.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  single batch between any two nodes.&nbsp; Each batch represents a<br>&nbsp;  measurable entity unambiguously recognizable by all network nodes<br>&nbsp;  along the path.<br><br>(Same remark about "unambiguous" as above)<br><br>&nbsp;  It is worth mentioning that the length of the batches is considered<br>&nbsp;  stable over time in the previous figure.&nbsp; In theory, it is possible<br><br>I'd consider "duration" rather than "length", here (indeed, the figure<br>shows batches of both 10 and 11 packets, and possibly 9 as well if<br>"batch 1" is not considered to be truncated<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The FlowMonID field is used in the AltMark Option as identifier of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the monitored flow.&nbsp; It represents a more sensitive information<br><br>"identifier" needs an article;

Is the intent that (a) this is only used for traffic that begins and ends in the domain; (b) user traffic is encapsulated with an outer IPv6 header that is removed prior to domain exit; or (c) the "destination" actually means the egress point from the domain?<br><br>(2) Relatedly, if the source nodes are&nbsp; user-generated packets, how is this in practice a limited domain? Source nodes have enormous power to degrade the measurement by sending packets that fill the entire FlowMon space with only 1M packets, which not only consumes router resources but also pollutes every single measurement in the domain.<br> <br>(3) The draft informatively references the (Experimental) RFCs 8321 and 8889 and covers some of the same ground, but as a Proposed Standard. Is part of the purpose here to update these RFCs? For other measurement techniques, we've had a generic measurement draft in IPPM and encapsulations in the appropriate protocol-specific groups like 6man. Why was that approach not taken here? Will future encapsulations of alternate marking refer to this one normatively on how to conduct the measurement?<br><br>(4) Are there any restrictions on FlowMon IDs? Need these be pseudorandom, or can they encode information in the clear?<br><br>(5) I don't understand the basic motivation for using HBH options if these can result in the packet being diverted to the slow path on intermediate nodes. This seems like a major drawback for a delay measurement!<br><br>(6) Sec 5.1: When using timer-based batches, I gather you use times well in excess of potential reordering. If using a counter-based method, how does the measurement account for potential reordering? There could easily be a very large instantaneous burst followed by a path change that lowered the latency.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed standard.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes how the Alternate Marking Method can be used as a passive performance measurement tool in an IPv6 domain.&nbsp; It defines a new Extension Header Option to encode alternate marking information in both the Hop-by-Hop Options Header and Destination Options Header.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>This has had discussion on the ipv6 list and detailed comments were received from several people.&nbsp; General support for advancing this document.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>There is at least one commercial implementation of alternate marking for MPLS and SRv6.<br>An implementation of this draft (alternative marking for HBH and DestOpt options) as a proof of concept is in progress.<br>This implementation is using an experimental code point.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Shepherd: Ole Troan<br>AD: Erik Kline<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>Greg Mirsky and Brian Carpenter reviewed the document as part of the WG last call. The 6man chairs (including shepherd) reviewed the document in detail and provided comments that were incorporated in the draft<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br>Extension header option format reviewed by 6man.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>Yes, there are two IPRs filed.<br>No working group discussion has been had.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There is good support among the interested individuals.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>No nits found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>IANA section has been reviewed. The correct IANA registries are identified.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?
