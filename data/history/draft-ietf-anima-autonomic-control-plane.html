 TLS MUST offer TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and<br>&nbsp;  TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and MUST NOT offer options<br>&nbsp;  with less than 256 bit symmetric key strength or hash strength of<br>&nbsp;  less than SHA384.&nbsp; When TLS 1.3 is supported, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384<br><br>One could potentially say "hash strength of less than 384 bits" instead<br>of anchoring the reference point at SHA384, but I'm not terribly<br>concerned about it.<br><br>&nbsp;  TLS MUST also include the "Supported Elliptic Curves" extension, it<br>&nbsp;  MUST support the NIST P-256 (secp256r1(22)) and P-384 (secp384r1(24))<br>&nbsp;  curves [<a href="/doc/rfc4492/">RFC4492</a>].&nbsp; In addition, TLS clients SHOULD send an<br>&nbsp;  ec_point_formats extension with a single element, "uncompressed".<br><br>We can say "TLS 1.2 clients" for the ec_point_format extension (nit: no 's').<br><br>Section 6.2.1<br><br>Thank you for clarifying the "serialNumber" attribute; I think that will<br>be helpful for a lot of people.<br><br>&nbsp;  ACP nodes MUST NOT support certificates with RSA public keys whose<br>&nbsp;  modulus is less than 2048 bits, or certificates whose ECC public keys<br>&nbsp;  are in groups whose order is less than 256 bits.&nbsp; RSA signing<br>&nbsp;  certificates with 2048-bit public keys MUST be supported, and such<br><br>I think I mentioned this previously (and sorry for the repetition if I<br>did), but just in case I didn't: this 256-bit group order requirement<br>excludes Ed25519 and friends.&nbsp; If you're fine with that, that's okay; I<br>just want to make sure it's an informed choice.<br><br>&nbsp;  ACP nodes MUST support RSA certificates that are signed by RSA<br>&nbsp;  signatures over the SHA-256 digest of the contents, and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  additionally support SHA-384 and SHA-512 digests in such signatures.<br>&nbsp;  The same requirements for certificate signatures apply to ECDSA<br>&nbsp;  certificates, and additionally, ACP nodes MUST support ECDSA<br>&nbsp;  signatures on ECDSA certificates.<br><br>I think "same requirements for digest usage in certificate signatures"<br>is more accurate.<br><br>&nbsp;  In support of ECDH key establishment, ACP certificates with ECC keys<br>&nbsp;  MUST indicate to be Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman capable (ECDH): If<br>&nbsp;  the X.509v3 keyUsage extension is present, the keyAgreement bit MUST<br>&nbsp;  be set.<br><br>I think I may have failed to think about and comment on this previously,<br>but doing direct ECDH with the (static) key in the certificate is pretty<br>uncommon -- as I understand it you don't need this bit set in order to<br>use the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuite, for<br>example.&nbsp; To be clear, I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make this<br>requirement, just that I don't think it's needed for the use-cases<br>presented in this document.&nbsp; (It may also make it harder to get such<br>certificates issued in the future, though it's hard to predict what<br>path CA policies will take in the future.)<br><br>Section 6.2.3<br><br>It might be nice to say something about in what cases the transport<br>address used to reach the peer can/cannot be validated against the<br>acp-address in the peer's ACP certificate.&nbsp; I think there are some<br>classes of interactions for which that check can be done and would add<br>value, even though there are definitely some classes of interaction for<br>which it is not viable.<br><br>Section 6.2.5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  When using a private PKI for ACP certificates, the CRL may be need-<br>&nbsp;  to-know, for example to prohibit insight into the operational<br>&nbsp;  practices of the domain by tracking the growth of the CRL.&nbsp; In this<br>&nbsp;  case, HTTPS may be chosen to provide confidentiality, especially when<br>&nbsp;  making the CRL available via the Data-Plane.&nbsp; Authentication and<br>&nbsp;  authorization SHOULD use ACP certificates and ACP domain membership<br>&nbsp;  check.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(I assume that the SHOULD here is still only in the case where the CRL<br>is need-to-know; no text changes needed if that's correct.)<br><br>Section 6.2.5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  To prohibit attacks that attempt to force the ACP node to forget its<br>&nbsp;  prior (expired) certificate and TA, the ACP node should alternate<br>&nbsp;  between attempting to re-enroll using its old keying material and<br>&nbsp;  attempting to re-enroll with its IDevID and requesting a voucher.<br><br>I think that as written, this doesn't fully "prohibit" such attacks (but<br>does make them harder and is good advice).&nbsp; I suppose some nodes might<br>continue trying with the old key material for some time even after<br>obtaining a new voucher, but the state-keeping requirements for that are<br>big enough that we shouldn't require it.&nbsp; So I'd suggest just a small<br>change like s/To prohibit/As a countermeasure against/.<br><br>&nbsp;  Maintaining existing TA information is especially important when<br>&nbsp;  enrollment mechanisms are used that unlike BRSKI do not leverage a<br>&nbsp;  mechanism (such as the voucher in BRSKI) to authenticate the ACP<br>&nbsp;  registrar and where therefore the injection of certificate failures<br>&nbsp;  could otherwise make the ACP node easily attackable remotely by<br>&nbsp;  returning the ACP node to a "duckling" state in which it accepts to<br>&nbsp;  be enrolled by any network it connects to.&nbsp; The (expired) ACP<br>&nbsp;  certificate and ACP TA SHOULD therefore be maintained and used for<br>&nbsp;  re-enrollment until new keying material is enrolled.<br><br>(editorial) the wording here should probably be checked; right now it<br>seeems to be saying "use X for re-enrollment until [re-enrollment<br>succeeds]" which makes me wonder how the new keying material would come<br>into play.<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>Figure 7 has some nits, now -- '|' is not a CDDL keyword.<br>Also, we should probably get a CDDL expert to look at it, since both<br>method-params and extensions are 1*any, and I'm not 100% sure what the<br>order of binding is (Appendix A of <a href="/doc/rfc8610/">RFC 8610</a> suggests that it is a<br>prioritized choice in CDDL, so things after the first comma would always<br>be parameters, not extensions).<br><br>&nbsp;  Attackers on a subnet may be able to inject malicious DULL GRASP<br>&nbsp;  messages that are indistinguishable from non-malicious DULL GRASP<br>&nbsp;  messages to create Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that force ACP<br>&nbsp;  nodes to attempt many unsuccessful ACP secure channel connections.<br>&nbsp;  When an ACP node sees multiple AN_ACP objectives for the same secure<br>&nbsp;  channel protocol on different transport addresses, it SHOULD prefer<br>&nbsp;  connecting via the well-known transport address if the secure channel<br>&nbsp;  method has one (such as UDP port 500 for IKEv2).<br><br>This new text should probably be run by some TSV-area reviewer (e.g.,<br>AD).<br><br>Section 6.8.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; software.&nbsp; Without the ability to talk to the CA, a malicious EST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server can still attract ACP nodes attempting to renew their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keying material, but they will fail to perform successful renewal<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a valid ACP certificate.&nbsp; The ACP node attempting to use the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; malicious EST server can then continue to use a different EST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server, and log a failure against a malicious EST server.<br><br>We have two copies of basically this text.&nbsp;

 ownership of the domain-name of AcpNodeNames to the public CA.<br>&nbsp;  However, maintaining the ULA based address allocation when using a<br>&nbsp;  public CA might be considered to be a violation of the private<br>&nbsp;  allocation expectation of ULA prefixes.&nbsp; To avoid this issue, further<br>&nbsp;  changes to registrar address allocation procedures might be needed,<br>&nbsp;  for example using global IPv6 address prefixes owned by the public CA<br>&nbsp;

 This document describes a modular design for a self-forming, self-<br>&nbsp;  managing and self-protecting ACP, which is a virtual out-of-band<br>&nbsp;  network designed to be as independent as possible of configuration,<br>&nbsp;  addressing and routing and similar self-dependency problems in<br>&nbsp;  current IP networks, but which is still operating in-band on the same<br>&nbsp;  physical network that it is controlling and managing.&nbsp; The ACP design<br><br>nit: the antecedent for "similar self-dependency problems" seems to be<br>intended to be the issues with in-band OAM/control-plane that were<br>discussed a couple paragraphs prior, but grammatically we have to look<br>for a local binding within the same list.&nbsp; So probably we want something<br>more like "avoiding the self-dependency problems of current IP<br>networks".<br><br>&nbsp;  In a fully autonomic network node without legacy control or<br>&nbsp;  management functions/protocols, the Data-Plane would be for example<br>&nbsp;  just a forwarding plane for "Data" IPv6 packets, aka: packets that<br>&nbsp;  are not forwarded by the ACP itself such as control or management<br>&nbsp;  plane packets.&nbsp; In such networks/nodes, there would be no non-<br><br>nit: I suggest rewording to "packets other than the control and<br>management plane packets that are forwarded by the ACP itself" to avoid<br>ambiguity about whether the "such as" matches "forwarded by the ACP<br>itself" or "data packets".<br><br>Section 1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The implementation footprint of the ACP consists of Public Key<br>&nbsp;  Infrastructure (PKI) code for the ACP certificate, the GRASP<br>&nbsp;  protocol, UDP, TCP and TLS 1.2 ([<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>], for security and<br><br>I agree with Barry that it's best to just say "TLS".&nbsp; Referencing both<br>8446 and 5246 is okay, but 8446 needs to be there.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; For each entry in the candidate adjacency list, the node<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  negotiates a secure tunnel using the candidate channel types.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  See Section 6.5.<br><br>Somewhere in this procedure (not necessarily exactly here), we might<br>want to say something about how failed<br>authentication/negotiation/authorization/etc. means that the candidate<br>peer adjacency is not accepted into the ACP, rejected, discarded, or<br>something of that nature.&nbsp; Having the main focus be on the success case<br>rather than the detailed error handling makes sense for an overview, but<br>if we are listing only "candidate" adjacencies we probably ought to<br>acknowledge that not all candidates succeed.<br><br>Section 6.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  ACP nodes MUST NOT support certificates with RSA public keys of less<br>&nbsp;  than 2048 bit modulus or curves with group order of less than 256<br>&nbsp;  bit.&nbsp; They MUST support certificates with RSA public keys with 2048<br>&nbsp;  bit modulus and MAY support longer RSA keys.&nbsp; They MUST support<br>&nbsp;  certificates with ECC public keys using NIST P-256 curves and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  support P-384 and P-521 curves.<br><br>We probably can nail this down a bit more, particularly on the ECC side<br>as being ECDSA signatures (but RSA as well to be signatures vs.<br>encryption).&nbsp; Maybe something like:<br><br>% ACP nodes MUST NOT support certificates with RSA public keys whose<br>% modulus is less than 2048 bits, or certificates whose ECC public keys<br>% are in groups whose order is less than 256 bits.&nbsp; RSA signing<br>% certificates with 2048-bit public keys MUST be supported, and such<br>% certificates with longer public keys MAY be supported.&nbsp; ECDSA<br>% certificates using the NIST P-256 curve MUST be supported, and such<br>% certificates using the P-384 and P-521 curves SHOULD be supported.<br><br>Also, 2048-bit RSA is starting to look shaky; note that<br><a href="/doc/draft-cooley-cnsa-dtls-tls-profile/">draft-cooley-cnsa-dtls-tls-profile</a> insists on 3072-bit or larger at this<br>point, which would be my own personal recommendation as well.<br><br>&nbsp;  ACP nodes MUST support SHA-256 and SHOULD support SHA-384, SHA-512<br>&nbsp;  signatures for certificates with RSA key and the same RSA signatures<br>&nbsp;  plus ECDSA signatures for certificates with ECC key.<br><br>We should probably reword this to be clearer that we're talking about<br>the signature on the certificate, not the signatures made by the<br>certificate.&nbsp; Perhaps:<br><br>% ACP nodes MUST support RSA certificates that are signed by RSA<br>% signatures over the SHA-256 digest of the contents, and SHOULD<br>% additionally support SHA-384 and SHA-512 digests in such signatures.<br>% The same requirements for certificate signatures apply to ECDSA<br>% certificates, and additionally, ACP nodes MUST support ECDSA<br>% signatures on ECDSA certificates.<br><br>&nbsp;  The ACP certificate SHOULD use an RSA key and an RSA signature when<br>&nbsp;  the ACP certificate is intended to be used not only for ACP<br>&nbsp;  authentication but also for other purposes.&nbsp; The ACP certificate MAY<br>&nbsp;  use an ECC key and an ECDSA signature if the ACP certificate is only<br>&nbsp;  used for ACP and ANI authentication and authorization.<br><br>There may be a mismatch in the normative guidance here: we have MUST<br>baseline guidance earlier for 2048-bit RSA and P-256, but SHOULD<br>(stronger than MAY) for P-384/P-521 and only MAY for &gt;2048-bit-RSA.&nbsp;

Instead, it may better be decided in real-time including<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; potentially a human decision in a NOC.<br><br>(ditto)<br><br>Section 9.3.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Automatically setting "ANI enable" on brownfield nodes where the<br>&nbsp;  operator is unaware of BRSKI and MASA operations could also be an<br>&nbsp;  unlikely but then critical security issue.&nbsp; If an attacker could<br>&nbsp;  impersonate the operator and register as the operator at the MASA or<br>&nbsp;  otherwise get hold of vouchers and can get enough physical access to<br>&nbsp;  the network so pledges would register to an attacking registrar, then<br>&nbsp;  the attacker could gain access to the network through the ACP that<br>&nbsp;  the attacker then has access to.<br><br>nit(?): this last bit ("gain access ... then has access to") is easy to<br>read as being a tautology.&nbsp; Maybe "attacker could gain access to the<br>ACP, and through the ACP gain access to the data plane"?<br><br>Section 9.3.5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Attempts for BRSKI pledge operations in greenfield state should<br>&nbsp;  terminate automatically when another method of configuring the node<br>&nbsp;  is used.&nbsp; Methods that indicate some form of physical possession of<br>&nbsp;  the device such as configuration via the serial console port could<br>&nbsp;  lead to immediate termination of BRSKI, while other parallel auto<br>&nbsp;  configuration methods subject to remote attacks might lead to BRSKI<br>&nbsp;  termination only after they were successful.&nbsp; Details of this may<br>&nbsp;  vary widely over different type of nodes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Most of this seems appropriate for, and (IIRC) already in, BRSKI itself<br>and may not need repetition here.<br><br>Section 9.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the non-autonomous ACP-Core VPN would require additional<br>&nbsp;  extensions to propagate GRASP messages when GRASP discovery is<br>&nbsp;  desired across the zones.&nbsp; For example, one could set up on each Zone<br>&nbsp;  edge router remote ACP tunnel to an appplication level implemented<br>&nbsp;  GRASP hub running in the networks NOC that is generating GRASP<br>&nbsp;  announcements for NOC services into the ACP Zones or propagating them<br>&nbsp;  between ACP Zones.<br><br>There's enough nits here that I've lost the intended meaning.&nbsp; Is it:<br><br>% For example, one could set up on each Zone edge router a remote ACP<br>% tunnel to a GRASP hub, implemented at the application level, that runs<br>% in the NOC for the network and serves to propagage GRASP announcements<br>% between ACP Zones and/or generate GRASP announcements for NOC services<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Merging two networks with different TA requires the ACP nodes to<br>&nbsp;  trust the union of TA.&nbsp; As long as the routing-subdomain hashes are<br>&nbsp;  different, the addressing will not overlap, which only happens in the<br>&nbsp;  unlikely event of a 40-bit hash collision in SHA256 (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 6.10).&nbsp; Note that the complete mechanisms to merge networks<br>&nbsp;  is out of scope of this specification.<br><br>Maybe "only happens accidentally"?&nbsp;

Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such registry is requested in this document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no such parts to the document.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Experience with a prototype implementation of GRASP confirms that a <br>simple interface with the ACP, based on standard UDP and TCP sockets <br>connected to the network interfaces provided by the ACP VRF, is necessary and sufficient.<br><br>The following information about use and deployment experience of the ACP<br>design was provided to the shepherd by the ACP authors:<br><br>The ACP specification draws a lot of experience and confidence in the<br>feasibility and value of the design from commercial implementations of<br>pre-standard implementations and their deployment.&nbsp; It also draws experience<br>from open source implementations and design of components, for example <br>the SNBI project in OpenDaylight, which also inherits some of the work done <br>for one of the commercial implementations.<br><br>One series of commercial implementations specifically supports all the core aspects<br>of the ACP such as auto-configuration of the ACP as a separate VRF<br>protected from operator configuration, relying on a bootstrap provisioned domain<br>certificate to provide mutual authentication and authorization and domain name<br>derived ULA addressing for the ACP node itself. Also the RPL routing protocol<br>and its profile, and connectivity to non-ACP components via ACP connect interfaces.<br><br>Several aspects of the ACP did evolve from improving upon these pre-standard<br>experiences. This includes primarily the use of GRASP for neighbor discovery and<br>service/objective discovery across the ACP as opposed to a vendor proprietary<br>protocol and multi-hop DNS-SD inside the ACP. The GRASP and ACP authors think that<br>the choice of GRASP provides simplification, generalization and better mechanisms<br>for flooding densely used service information. This was backed by experiences with <br>GRASP&nbsp; reference implementations, also open source (see also shepherd writeup for GRASP).<br><br>The described certificate management for the ACP including the concept of registrar<br>likewise is based on implementation and large-scale ACP planning with customers and <br>their CA infrastructure (often up to three layers).&nbsp; Commercial implementations used <br>where relying on the older SCEP enrollment protocol instead of the IETF standard EST <br>(<a href="/doc/rfc7030/">RFC7030</a>) chosen for ACP certificate renewal.<br><br>Some enhancements over commercially available implementations where introduced<br>through the WG work, review and requirements raised. This includes address<br>auto-configuration of ACP interfaces, better structured/extensible encoding of<br>ACP attributes into the domain certificate and more addressing choices for the<br>ACP to better support various use-cases (large networks with multiple zones...<br>networks with ACP nodes that require many addresses inside the ACP).<br></div></td>

Original COMMENT is left below.<br><br>General:<br><br>Please address the Gen-ART reviewer's latest round of comments.<br><br>There are a bunch of places in this document where it seems like there is a tension between specifying a limited set of functionality here and being able to support a wider variety of deployment scenarios. This is noted in Section 1 but I think in general it would be clearer if uses of the term "future" throughout the document could be more surgical as well as more specific about whether they mean "people might deploy this differently in the future" or "standards would need to be developed in the future." I've made a few suggestions about some of these turns of phrase below but would suggest someone do a full edit pass with this in mind because there are a large number of mentions of "future work." Of course there is always more work to do, but every bit of "future work" need not be mentioned in this document, and in cases where it is mentioned I think there should be a specific reason for doing so that bears on people implementing this specification. I don't think this fits in the DISCUSS criteria but for a document that intends to be published on the standards track I would expect it to be crisper about the dividing line between the normative behavior being specified here versus changes or extensions that may or may not be made in the future.<br><br>"Intent" is used both capitalized and in lower case throughout the document and I'm unclear if this is meant to signify a distinction or not.<br><br>Section 2: <br><br>Please remove the --&gt;"..."() notation.<br><br>Please use the exact boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>, not a variation.<br><br>It seems like RFC citations should appear for IKEv2 and DTLS upon first use in this section. Otherwise, it seems they are first cited at different future points in the document (Section 6.3 and 6.7, respectively).<br><br>Section 3.3:<br><br>"The ACP provides reachability that is independent of the Data-Plane<br>&nbsp;  (except for the dependency discussed in Section 6.12.2 which can be<br>&nbsp;  removed through future work),"<br><br>Isn't this kind of a big exception, given that there is meant to be a secure channel between pairs of nodes in the ACP and that developing future encapsulations is non-trivial? It seems like phrasing this the other way around (the ACP is dependent on the Data-Plane for&nbsp; but is otherwise independent of it) would be more accurate.<br><br>Section 6:<br><br>"Indestructible" seems like an overstatement. Maybe "resilient" would be more accurate?<br><br>Section 6.1.1:<br><br>s/Such methods are subject to future work though./No such methods have been defined at the time of publication of this document./<br><br>s/to build ACP channel/to build ACP channels/<br><br>s/that intends to be equally unique/that it intends to be equally unique/ <br><br>""rsub" is optional; its syntax is defined in this document,<br>&nbsp;  but its semantics are for further study.&nbsp; Understanding the benefits<br>&nbsp;  of using rsub may depend on the results of future work on enhancing<br>&nbsp;  routing for the ACP."<br><br>What is the point of defining this now when it is unclear if or how it will be used? There are already means for nodes to do error handling, so it seems like defining a new field in the future if/when it is needed would work fine and be cleaner. Appendix A.7 seems to assume some semantics for this field, which makes the way it is specified here even more confusing IMO. <br><br>"In this specification, the "acp-address" field is REQUIRED, but<br>&nbsp;  future variations (see Appendix A.8) may use local information to<br>&nbsp;  derive the ACP address.&nbsp; In this case, "acp-address" could be empty.<br>&nbsp;  Such a variation would be indicated by an appropriate "extension".<br>&nbsp;  If "acp-address" is empty, and "rsub" is empty too, the "local-part"<br>&nbsp;  will have the format "rfcSELF + + extension(s)".&nbsp; The two plus<br>&nbsp;  characters are necessary so the node can unambiguously parse that<br>&nbsp;  both "acp-address" and "rsub" are empty."<br><br>This seems contradictory. Either "acp-address" is REQUIRED in which case there are no exceptions, or it's not; if it's not, then the expected syntax for cases when it's not present should be specified.<br><br>Section 6.1.2:<br><br>s/If the node certificates indicates/If the node certificate indicates/<br><br>Section 6.3:<br><br>It seems odd to provide a citation/discussion for IKEv2 here but not for DTLS.<br><br>Section 6.4:<br><br>This is a good example of a section where the blurring between the specified behavior and expectations for the future is unhelpful IMO. Why specify the current default and then spend a lot of words (including Appendix A.7) talking about how it will be different in the future?<br><br>Section 6.10.3.1:<br><br>s/We do not think this is required at this point/This is not currently required/<br><br>Section 6.12.2:<br><br>s/may specify additional layer 2 or layer encapsulations/may specify additional layer 2 or layer 3 encapsulations/ (I think?)<br><br>Section 8.2.1:<br><br>This seems extraneous: "Future work could transform this into a YANG ([<a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC7950</a>]) data<br>&nbsp;  model."<br>&nbsp;  <br>Appendix A.8:<br><br>"Secure channels may<br>&nbsp;  even be replaced by simple neighbor authentication to create<br>&nbsp;  simplified ACP variations for environments where no real security is<br>&nbsp;  required but just protection against non-malicious misconfiguration."<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think experience has shown that even environments where it is assumed that security is not required prove to need it. I would suggest removing this text or changing this implication.</div></td>

&nbsp; &nbsp; must not be listed in the CRL retrieved from the CDP.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>side note: we could (but don't have to)&nbsp; note that OCSP stapling is a<br>way to get an OCSP response to check.<br><br>&nbsp;

 When an ACP node learns later via OCSP/CRL that an ACP peers<br>&nbsp;  certificate for which rule 4 had to be skipped during ACP secure<br>&nbsp;  channel establishment is invalid, then the ACP secure channel to that<br>&nbsp;

 the ACP such that GRASP is not only protected by attacks from the<br>&nbsp;  outside, but also by attacks from compromised inside attackers - by<br>&nbsp;  relying not only on hop-by-hop security of ACP secure channels, but<br>&nbsp;  adding end-to-end security for those GRASP messages.&nbsp; See<br>&nbsp;  Section 6.8.2.<br><br>This is true, but the system as a whole still has the weakness that the<br>compromised node is able to announce GRASP objectives for arbitrary<br>services and potentially cause legitimate traffic to be directed towards<br>it.&nbsp;

This is noted in Section 1 but I think in general it would be clearer if uses of the term "future" throughout the document could be more surgical as well as more specific about whether they mean "people might deploy this differently in the future" or "standards would need to be developed in the future." I've made a few suggestions about some of these turns of phrase below but would suggest someone do a full edit pass with this in mind because there are a large number of mentions of "future work." Of course there is always more work to do, but every bit of "future work" need not be mentioned in this document, and in cases where it is mentioned I think there should be a specific reason for doing so that bears on people implementing this specification. I don't think this fits in the DISCUSS criteria but for a document that intends to be published on the standards track I would expect it to be crisper about the dividing line between the normative behavior being specified here versus changes or extensions that may or may not be made in the future.<br><br>"Intent" is used both capitalized and in lower case throughout the document and I'm unclear if this is meant to signify a distinction or not.<br><br>Section 2: <br><br>Please remove the --&gt;"..."() notation.<br><br>Please use the exact boilerplate from <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>, not a variation.<br><br>It seems like RFC citations should appear for IKEv2 and DTLS upon first use in this section. Otherwise, it seems they are first cited at different future points in the document (Section 6.3 and 6.7, respectively).<br><br>Section 3.3:<br><br>"The ACP provides reachability that is independent of the Data-Plane<br>&nbsp;  (except for the dependency discussed in Section 6.12.2 which can be<br>&nbsp;  removed through future work),"<br><br>Isn't this kind of a big exception, given that there is meant to be a secure channel between pairs of nodes in the ACP and that developing future encapsulations is non-trivial? It seems like phrasing this the other way around (the ACP is dependent on the Data-Plane for&nbsp; but is otherwise independent of it) would be more accurate.<br><br>Section 6:<br><br>"Indestructible" seems like an overstatement. Maybe "resilient" would be more accurate?<br><br>Section 6.1.1:<br><br>s/Such methods are subject to future work though./No such methods have been defined at the time of publication of this document./<br><br>s/to build ACP channel/to build ACP channels/<br><br>s/that intends to be equally unique/that it intends to be equally unique/ <br><br>""rsub" is optional; its syntax is defined in this document,<br>&nbsp;  but its semantics are for further study.&nbsp; Understanding the benefits<br>&nbsp;  of using rsub may depend on the results of future work on enhancing<br>&nbsp;  routing for the ACP."<br><br>What is the point of defining this now when it is unclear if or how it will be used? There are already means for nodes to do error handling, so it seems like defining a new field in the future if/when it is needed would work fine and be cleaner. Appendix A.7 seems to assume some semantics for this field, which makes the way it is specified here even more confusing IMO. <br><br>"In this specification, the "acp-address" field is REQUIRED, but<br>&nbsp;  future variations (see Appendix A.8) may use local information to<br>&nbsp;  derive the ACP address.&nbsp; In this case, "acp-address" could be empty.<br>&nbsp;  Such a variation would be indicated by an appropriate "extension".<br>&nbsp;  If "acp-address" is empty, and "rsub" is empty too, the "local-part"<br>&nbsp;  will have the format "rfcSELF + + extension(s)".&nbsp; The two plus<br>&nbsp;  characters are necessary so the node can unambiguously parse that<br>&nbsp;  both "acp-address" and "rsub" are empty."<br><br>This seems contradictory. Either "acp-address" is REQUIRED in which case there are no exceptions, or it's not; if it's not, then the expected syntax for cases when it's not present should be specified.<br><br>Section 6.1.2:<br><br>s/If the node certificates indicates/If the node certificate indicates/<br><br>Section 6.3:<br><br>It seems odd to provide a citation/discussion for IKEv2 here but not for DTLS.<br><br>Section 6.4:<br><br>This is a good example of a section where the blurring between the specified behavior and expectations for the future is unhelpful IMO. Why specify the current default and then spend a lot of words (including Appendix A.7) talking about how it will be different in the future?<br><br>Section 6.10.3.1:<br><br>s/We do not think this is required at this point/This is not currently required/<br><br>Section 6.12.2:<br><br>s/may specify additional layer 2 or layer encapsulations/may specify additional layer 2 or layer 3 encapsulations/ (I think?)<br><br>Section 8.2.1:<br><br>This seems extraneous: "Future work could transform this into a YANG ([<a href="/doc/rfc7950/">RFC7950</a>]) data<br>&nbsp;  model."<br>&nbsp;  <br>Appendix A.8:<br><br>"Secure channels may<br>&nbsp;  even be replaced by simple neighbor authentication to create<br>&nbsp;  simplified ACP variations for environments where no real security is<br>&nbsp;  required but just protection against non-malicious misconfiguration."<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think experience has shown that even environments where it is assumed that security is not required prove to need it. I would suggest removing this text or changing this implication.</div></td>

There was unanimous support for it in favor of adoption and <br>&nbsp; none against, so this document was adopted in August 2015. There was <br>&nbsp; interest in this work posts since its adoption. There was never any <br>&nbsp; opposition for this work.<br><br>&nbsp; This document went through a relevant long document development<br>&nbsp; period (10 months for individual document period, 29 month for WG <br>&nbsp; document period). It has been reviewed well.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?

In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the <br>request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; This document went through multiple reviews by multiple participants.<br>&nbsp; So far, there is no existing implementations. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with<br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware<br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the<br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.

If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. The authors, Michael H. Behringer, Steinthor Bjarnason and Toerless Eckert <br>&nbsp; have confirmed in writing that they are not aware of any IPR, and that any and<br>&nbsp; all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions <br>&nbsp; of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br>&nbsp; <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?

Does it represent the<br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There was broad support for this document. It was reviewed by active WG <br>&nbsp; participants. <br>&nbsp; <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>Responsible Area Director.

If such normative references<br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No. All normative references are published RFCs.<br>&nbsp; <br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so,<br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call<br>procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this<br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No. This document does not update any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The IANA is requested to register the value AN_ACP and SRV.est to the GRASP <br>&nbsp; Objectives Names Table in the GRASP Parameter Registry.<br><br>&nbsp; The IANA is requested to create an ACP Parameter Registry with currently one <br>&nbsp; registry table: the "ACP Address Type" Table (without quotes). In the "ACP <br>&nbsp; Address Type" Table, 2 intial values are assigned for "ACP Zone Addressing <br>&nbsp; Sub-Scheme" and "ACP Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme" (without quotes).<br><br>&nbsp; All the necessary information is in the IANA considerations document. It is<br>&nbsp; clear enough that the IANA will be able to implement it.<br>&nbsp; <br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such registry is requested in this document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no such parts to the document.</div></td>
