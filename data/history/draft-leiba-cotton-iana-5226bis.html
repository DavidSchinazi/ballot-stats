(Incidentally the text<br>in -15 does impose on other streams when it says that they<br>have to specify how DEs are handled, so the IETF stream is<br>impinging on others already.)<br><br>(3) Section 8 says: "In no case is it reasonable to leave<br>documentation pointers to the obsoleted document for any<br>registries or registered items that are still in current<br>use." We had a nice big discussion about this back a few<br>years ago and there were two sides to the argument as I<br>recall.&nbsp; On what basis can the authors now say that this is<br>quite so clear? The strong counter argument to this is that<br>developers do not start from IANA, they start from RFCs.<br><br>(4) 9.2: that's news to me, how much of this is there?&nbsp; I<br>think having IANA be making policy is not necessarily a good<br>plan, though I see this was in 5226. Should we change this<br>now or not? (Just asking but if we think "yes" then we migth<br>need another LC I guess. If the answer is "no" then this<br>discuss point goes away.)</div></td>

That'll be<br>tomorrow though but in the meantime please consider that<br>I consider these as still discuss-worthy, and we can start<br>discussing during the day before the telechat. I didn't <br>check the comments at all yet.)<br><br>There're 5 points here, but they should each be v.&nbsp; quickly<br>handled I figure.<br><br>(1) 2.2: the MUSTs here are overstated. These are desirable<br>and not necessary. And we know such MUSTs will not be<br>honoured and we constantly survive that with nothing bad<br>happening other than a bit more work for a few folks. I'd say<br>loose the MUSTs. In general the same tendency is visible<br>throughout - that is, a tendency to impose a slightly too<br>high burden on authors via the use of 2119-like language and<br>I can see that causing trouble later for no good reason<br>maybe. I think an editing pass to tone that down in general<br>would be great and would significantly impove the document.<br>(The discuss will clear if the 2.2 stuff is handled, the rest<br>are almost all borderline already.)<br><br>(2) 5.2, last para: would we be better off if we got<br>agreement from the other streams that the IESG handles all<br>DEs? I think that's worth thinking about, 'cause it'd be fine<br>for IRTF I think and afaik that's the only real case at the<br>moment. And the IRSG haven't had to do such things. And it'd<br>be simpler I think. But if this is a bad plan, that's ok I'll<br>clear this bit.<br><br>(3) Section 8 says: "In no case is it reasonable to leave<br>documentation pointers to the obsoleted document for any<br>registries or registered items that are still in current<br>use." We had a nice big discussion about this back a year or<br>two ago and there were two sides to the argument as I recall.<br>On what basis can the authors now say that this is quite so<br>clear? The strong counter argument to this is that developers<br>do not start from IANA, they start from RFCs.<br><br>(4) 9.1: Why do IANA prefer that empty sections be left in<br>documents? I prefer getting rid of them myself and haven't<br>heard the logic behind that change. (Or maybe I wasn't paying<br>attention, in which case apologies:-)<br><br>(5) 9.2: that's news to me, how much of this is there?&nbsp; I<br>think having IANA be making policy is not necessarily a good<br>plan, though I see this was in 5226. Should we change this<br>now or not? (Just asking but if we think "yes" then we migth<br>need another LC I guess. If the answer is "no" then this<br>discuss point goes away.)</div></td>

I commented on this last time but the same problem still exists in this version. Right now the guidance amounts to: "include a URL, make sure it's a permalink, but we can't tell you how to find or construct a permalink reliably, so ask IANA, but we don't tell you how to ask." If we're far enough away from having a standard way to find or construct permalinks that we can't say anything more specific about how authors might figure out what to include, then I think it's preferable to just tell people to include a URL for the registry in question and note that IANA will confirm whether to replace it with a permalink as part of its document processing. Asking authors to have an additional back-and-forth with IANA because we don't have an easy way for authors to identify permalinks seems like a waste of time for both sides.</div></td>

E.g., Section 4.8 mentions twice in two paragraphs that documents will be last called, the last sentence of 4.11 is obvious enough to be omitted, the explanation of what a bis document is in Section 8 is unnecessary, Section 11 is superfluous, etc. It would be nice if someone could do a full edit pass and pare this doc down to its essence.<br><br>- I find the organization of Section 2 confusing. I agree with Benoit's old DISCUSS still -- I think the main thing authors are looking for here is the list of elements they need to include when creating a new registry. But Section 2 does not contain a single list. There is a brief list in the first sentence of the section, and then a longer list in 2.2, but then 2.3 and 3.2 talk about other items which are not included in the list in 2.2. I think this section would be clearer if it included a single list of the expected elements rather than multiple separate incomplete lists.<br><br>- Section 2.1: The table and the two paragraphs that follow it are unnecessary. Anyone reading this document can click the link and see exactly what is described here.<br><br>- Section 4.4: Is there any protocol parameter registry that still requires a postal address as a practical matter?<br><br>- Section 4.4, 4.5: The text about change control is duplicative of 2.3 and could be confusing, since 2.3 says to always specify a change controller and here it's being called out specifically for particular kinds of registries.<br><br>- Section 4.11: In Section 4.5 authors are told to include info about required documentation, review criteria, guidance, reasons for rejecting a request, etc. whenever choosing Expert Review as the policy. Does <a href="/doc/rfc3575/">RFC 3575</a> really give more detail than what would normally be expected when this policy is chosen? To me it seems like it gives a bit more process detail than usual, but not more criteria detail, and therefore calling it out seems to give the wrong impression about what authors should normally do when choosing Expert Review.</div></td>

Please come up with terminology for this version of the document and stick to it. I would very much prefer "Category" (or "Grouping") for the grouping and "Registry" for the thing that contains the namespace. The documentation requirement should be for the Registry name, and, if desired, the Category (or Grouping) into which the Registry goes. The grouping can be identified by name or (if it already exists) by URL. If you insist on using the terms "registry" and "sub-registry" (and I implore you not to), please at least define those terms in terms of category, grouping, and namespace. In any event, please do not update this document without fixing the problem.<br><br>2.2 - The size/format section makes it confusing as to whether you're defining technical *protocol* requirements (which don't belong in the registry definition) or requirements for the registry itself (i.e., how things are displayed or stored by IANA). I particularly don't like giving UTF8 as an example. If the thing in the registry is a text string, then "Zürich" is a fine entry, whether it is stored in the registry at IANA with the second character as U+00FC or U+0075 U+0308 (however encoded); the registry should point back elsewhere in the document to define the encoding requirements or the normalizations that might be used. However, if the thing in the registry is a specific UTF8-encoded octet-string, then what should appear in the registry should either contain "0xC3 0xBC" or it should contain "0x75 0xCC 0x88" and not appear as "ü". The paragraph should make that clear.<br><br>In the example, I'm not clear on what "under the FooBar option" means. That sounds like there is a Category called "FooBar Options" somewhere, but I don't think that's what you mean.</div></td>

I would suggest having all of the information about registration policies, both in general and specifically the well-known ones, in one section.<br><br>= Section 2.3.1 =<br>"The description in Section 4.10 of "IESG Approval" suggests that the<br>&nbsp;  IESG "can (and should) reject a request if another path for<br>&nbsp;  registration is available that is more appropriate and there is no<br>&nbsp;  compelling reason not to use that path."&nbsp; The IESG should give<br>&nbsp;  similar consideration to any registration policy more stringent than<br>&nbsp;  Expert Review or Specification Required, asking for justification and<br>&nbsp;  ensuring that more relaxed policies have been considered, and the<br>&nbsp;  strict policy is the right one."<br><br>The mixing of two different IESG functions here is really confusing. The first part appears to be talking about the situation in which the IESG is asked to approve a registration. The second one appears to be talking about the situation in which the IESG is asked to approve a document that asks IANA to create a new registry. Is that right? This would have made a lot more sense to me if it simply said, "When reviewing a document that asks IANA to create a new registry or change a registration policy to any policy more stringent than Expert Review or Specification Required, the IESG should ask for justification to ensure that more relaxed policies have been considered and that the strict policy is the right one."<br><br>= Section 2.3.3 =<br>s/desired/desirable/<br><br>= Section 2.4 =<br>"Remember to<br>&nbsp;  check this, and give clear instructions to IANA."<br>&nbsp;  <br>This is superfluous and could be deleted.<br><br>"Such documents are normally processed with the same document status<br>&nbsp;  as the document that created the registry, or as Best Current<br>&nbsp;  Practices (BCPs) [<a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a>]."<br><br>I know we've talked about this before, but it seems really odd to me to encourage people to write BCPs in order to add a column to an IANA registry.<br><br>= Section 4.5 =<br>This section should include a specific forward reference to 5.2.1 about how experts are chosen. This confuses a lot of people.<br><br>= Section 4.6 =<br>It might be worth including a few words in this section about whether review criteria (beyond evaluating the given spec for interoperability) need to be provided to the expert, since that is explicitly mentioned in Section 4.5.<br><br>= Section 4.8 =<br>Seems like this text from 4.7 should also be included here, if true (I think people get confused about this):<br><br>"Unless otherwise specified, any<br>&nbsp;  type of RFC is sufficient (currently Standards Track, BCP,<br>&nbsp;  Informational, Experimental, or Historic)."<br><br>= Section 4.10 =<br>"The IESG can (and should) reject a request if another path for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registration is available that is more appropriate and there is no<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compelling reason not to use that path."<br><br>I don't understand the scenario here. Is this for when there are multiple registration policies and IESG Approval is one of them? "Another path" seems vague.<br><br>= Section 5.2 =<br>"It has proven useful to have multiple designated experts for some<br>&nbsp;  registries.&nbsp; Sometimes those experts work together in evaluating a<br>&nbsp;  request, while in other cases additional experts serve as backups.<br>&nbsp;  In cases of disagreement among those experts, it is the<br>&nbsp;  responsibility of those experts to make a single clear recommendation<br>&nbsp;  to IANA.&nbsp; It is not appropriate for IANA to resolve disputes among<br>&nbsp;  experts.&nbsp; In extreme situations, such as deadlock, the designating<br>&nbsp;  body may need to step in to resolve the problem."<br><br>This paragraph needs to be reconciled with the paragraphs above it about having a pool of experts with a chair -- the information here seems to be in conflict with that description.<br><br>"Documents in other streams may<br>&nbsp;  use a registration policy that requires a designated expert only if<br>&nbsp;  those streams (or those documents) specify how designated experts are<br>&nbsp;  appointed and managed."<br><br>This seems to leave the reader hanging -- shouldn't we say whether the other streams have defined a process here and give references if so, are explain that no references exist if not?<br><br>= Section 5.3 =<br>"Possible reasons to deny a request include these:"<br><br>I think the preamble here needs to make clear that the criteria provided are for historical cases where guidance has not been provided to the expert. I don't think the criteria listed here should be interpreted as otherwise superseding the guidance provided to an expert through IETF consensus. <br><br>= Section 12 =<br>Not sure if I missed it, but I didn't see in this section or any other part of the document a discussion of how security considerations can factor into the selection of a registration policy. It seems to be somewhat common practice to consider the need for broad security review as a reason for specifying a stricter registration policy as opposed to a more lenient one. Perhaps the sec ADs have more to say about this, but this document seems like a reasonable place to discuss the relationship between security review and registration policies.</div></td>

Can you include a <br>forward pointer to the relevant section?<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Applicable review process <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The review process that will apply to all future requests for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registration.&nbsp; See Section 2.3.<br><br>Is this intended to be the assignment or registration policy?<br>(Although in section 2.3 you call it a "Regsitry Policy".)<br><br>---<br><br>Shouldn't 2.3 start with two lines saying what an Registry Policy is?<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Even when the space is essentially unlimited, however, it is usually<br>&nbsp;  desirable to have at least a minimal review prior to assignment in<br>&nbsp;  order to:<br><br>s/however, it is/it is still/<br><br>But I would quibble with "usually" since that flies in the face of FCFS.<br>And, indeed, subsequent text says<br>&nbsp;  When the namespace is essentially unlimited and there are no<br>&nbsp;  potential interoperability or security issues, assigned numbers can<br>&nbsp;  usually be given out to anyone without any subjective review.<br>which is the same "essentially unlimited".<br><br>---<br><br>Missing from, but implicit in the first two paragraphs of Section 2.3.1<br>is that ayone can make up any registration policy they like and that no-<br>one has grounds to object. If that is intended it should be said <br>(elsewhere you also only recommend - not mandate - the use of one of the<br>defined policies).<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.3.2<br><br>In the case of multiple registration policies that we see in the <br>registries today, there is typically poor or no guidance about the use<br>of the competing policies. Your text wisely says "Guidance should be <br>provided about when each policy is appropriate", but the example is a <br>bit woolly in that it only says *a* circumstance under which one of the<br>two policies should be used. It would help, I think, if the example <br>could be tighter and so give a better template for people defining <br>registries. For example,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IANA is asked to create the registry "Fruit Access Flags" as a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sub-registry of "Fruit Parameters".&nbsp; New registrations will be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; permitted through either the IETF Review policy or the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Specification Required policy [<a href="/doc/bcp26/">BCP26</a>].&nbsp; The latter should be used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; only for registrations requested by SDOs outside the IETF: all <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other registrations should use former.<br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.3.3 is new information and is potentially important. I think<br>the reader needs some help to distinguish this section from 2.3.4 (I <br>do! and my issues/questions here also apply to 2.3.4) and an example <br>would help (perhaps an example for an IETF review registry).<br><br>It may also be helpful to clarify here what type of RFCs we require for<br>what type of updates. For example, if I create a registry in a Standards<br>Track RFC that has a Standards Action registration policy, so I need a<br>Standards Track RFC to change that policy to IETF Review?<br><br>---<br><br>The last para of 2.3.3 needs to point to 4.4 (as well as 9.5).<br><br>---<br><br>3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  There is no need to mention what the assignment policy is when making<br>&nbsp;  new assignments in existing registries, as that should be clear from<br>&nbsp;  the references.<br><br>The exception being when there are multiple policies defined for a <br>registry and a choice is being made.<br><br>Equally, when a registry is subdivided into ranges with different <br>policies, the request must specify the range in order for IANA to <br>determine which policy applies.<br><br>---<br><br>3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When drafts need to specify numeric values for<br>&nbsp;  testing or early implementations, they will either request early<br>&nbsp;  allocation (see Section 3.4) or use values that have already been set<br>&nbsp;  aside for testing or experimentation.<br><br>This is good, but tends to imply that a draft can state speicific values<br>from experimental ranges. 3692 makes it clear that this is not the case.<br><br>---<br><br>3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note: In cases where authors feel that including the full table is<br>&nbsp;  too verbose or repetitive, authors should still include the table in<br>&nbsp;  the draft, but may include a note asking that the table be removed<br>&nbsp;  prior to publication of the final RFC.<br><br>On first and second reading I took this to mean "include the full <br>existing table from the registry and show your additions."

For the Expert Review policy, review and approval by a<br>&nbsp;  designated expert (see Section 5) is required.&nbsp; The required<br>&nbsp;  documentation and review criteria for use by the designated expert<br>&nbsp;  should be provided when defining the registry.&nbsp; For example, see<br>&nbsp;  Sections 6 and 7.2 in [<a href="/doc/rfc3748/">RFC3748</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  It is particularly important, when using a designated expert, to give<br>&nbsp;  clear guidance to the expert, laying out criteria for performing an<br>&nbsp;  evaluation and reasons for rejecting a request.&nbsp; When specifying a<br>&nbsp;  policy that involves a designated expert, the IANA Considerations<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD contain such guidance.<br><br>There is a bit of duplication in this text.
