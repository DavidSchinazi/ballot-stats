Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies the Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat<br>&nbsp;  Signaling (DOTS) signal channel, a protocol for signaling the need<br>&nbsp;  for protection against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks<br>&nbsp;  to a server capable of enabling network traffic mitigation on behalf<br>&nbsp;  of the requesting client.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; Shortly after <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a> was published in May 2020 a problem with a YANG module defined in it was discovered.<br>&nbsp; The WG decided to publish a -bis document to fix the problem. The -00 version of the draft was prepared<br>&nbsp; fairly quickly (in June 2020) and the document was adopted in August 2020 (with a good WG support for adoption).<br>&nbsp; The draft has been widely discussed and reviewed.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp; This draft is a -bis document for <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>, its main purpose is to fix YANG module. In addition it provides more<br>&nbsp; comprehensive description of error handling and makes minor changes to DOTS CBOR Key Values allocation.<br>&nbsp; This document doesn't change the DOTS Signal Channel protocol itself, in particular it doesn't change bits on the wire.<br>&nbsp; DOTS Signal Channel protocol was thoroughly discussed and reviewed. There are at least two interoperable implementations of this protocol.<br>&nbsp; The updated YANG module has been reviewed by YANG Doctors, who confirmed that they don't have problems with it.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp; Valery Smyslov (shepherd)<br>&nbsp; Benjamin Kaduk (AD)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>&nbsp; I have reviewed the document and found it ready.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; No. The document was a subject of several reviews in the WG and by external experts (YANG Doctors).<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>&nbsp; This document doesn't change the DOTS Signal Channel protocol, defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>, which was thoroughly reviewed<br>&nbsp; by TSV experts.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; This document requests IANA to update a number of records previously created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; Most update requests simply change references from "RFC8782" to "RFCXXXX".<br>&nbsp; IANA is also requested to update prefixes for the YANG modules in the&nbsp; "YANG Module Names" subregistry <br>&nbsp; within the "YANG Parameters" registry from "signal" to "dots-signal" and from "iana-signal" to "iana-dots-signal".<br><br>&nbsp; The only more substantial request to IANA is to update the "DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Key Values" from <br>&nbsp; the "Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel" IANA Registry, that was created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; The request is to reserve a range of one-octet CBOR Key Values for "comprehension-optional" keys.<br>&nbsp; The registration policy for this range is IETF Review.<br><br>&nbsp; Requests to IANA are consistent with document's body.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

(See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>&nbsp; idnits reports a few issues with this document, all of them are erroneous: weird spacing (in YANG module tree structure), missing reference to [RFCXXXX] (not a real reference), referencing TLS 1.2 (done on purpose) and downward normative reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7918/">RFC 7918</a> (described below).<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>&nbsp; The document contains a YANG module; it was thoroughly reviewed by YANG Doctors.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?

Note that <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a> contained this downward normative reference too.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC8782</a>. This is indicated in the title page header, listed in the Abstract and is discussed in the Introduction.<br>&nbsp; The document also contains summary of changes from <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; This document requests IANA to update a number of records previously created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; Most update requests simply change references from "RFC8782" to "RFCXXXX".<br>&nbsp; IANA is also requested to update prefixes for the YANG modules in the&nbsp; "YANG Module Names" subregistry <br>&nbsp; within the "YANG Parameters" registry from "signal" to "dots-signal" and from "iana-signal" to "iana-dots-signal".<br><br>&nbsp; The only more substantial request to IANA is to update the "DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Key Values" from <br>&nbsp; the "Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel" IANA Registry, that was created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; The request is to reserve a range of one-octet CBOR Key Values for "comprehension-optional" keys.<br>&nbsp; The registration policy for this range is IETF Review.<br><br>&nbsp; Requests to IANA are consistent with document's body.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>&nbsp; No new registries are defined by this document.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; The automated checks of YANG module done via datatracker showed no validation errors or warnings.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>&nbsp; The YANG module was checked with pyang (2.4.0) and yanglint (1.6.7) tools; no validation errors or warnings were found.<br><br></div></td>

The document updates YANG module describing data structures, so that it is more in line with YANG specification.<br>&nbsp; The updated YANG module has been reviewed by YANG Doctors twice - an Early Review and a Last Call Review.<br>&nbsp; I personally don't think that more reviews are needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>&nbsp; None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; All authors and contributors confirmed that they are not aware of any IPR related to this draft other than have been filed.<br><br>&nbsp; ** Mohamed Boucadair -- <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/-lbAm-E02-OgUZSFYJn5CdU6L8M/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/-lbAm-E02-OgUZSFYJn5CdU6L8M/</a><br>&nbsp; ** Jon Shallow -- <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/wP5kheyWwgXbEfISsjFWWV3DBGw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/wP5kheyWwgXbEfISsjFWWV3DBGw/</a><br>&nbsp; ** Tirumaleswar Reddy -- <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/9n4n_U1nOxyIIy6IVufK8DGDMyc/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dots/9n4n_U1nOxyIIy6IVufK8DGDMyc/</a><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>&nbsp; No IPR disclosure has been filed that reference this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; The WG consensus is solid.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>&nbsp; No real ID nits were found by idnits tool except for referencing old versions of some active I-Ds, that can easily be fixed during publication.<br>&nbsp; Note, that idnits tool reports an error of the following type: the abstract contains references [RFCXXXX]. In fact the text they encounter in is a note for RFC Editor and will be removed during publication.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>&nbsp; The document contains a YANG module; it was thoroughly reviewed by YANG Doctors.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; This document contains a normative reference to Informational <a href="/doc/rfc7918/">RFC 7918</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; The authors believe it's important to keep this reference because using <a href="/doc/rfc7918/">RFC 7918</a> allows to deliver dots signal messages sooner <br>&nbsp; and avoid extra delays that will jeopardize the mitigation. Note that <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a> contained this downward normative reference too.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC8782</a>. This is indicated in the title page header, listed in the Abstract and is discussed in the Introduction.<br>&nbsp; The document also contains summary of changes from <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; This document requests IANA to update a number of records previously created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; Most update requests simply change references from "RFC8782" to "RFCXXXX".<br>&nbsp; IANA is also requested to update prefixes for the YANG modules in the&nbsp; "YANG Module Names" subregistry <br>&nbsp; within the "YANG Parameters" registry from "signal" to "dots-signal" and from "iana-signal" to "iana-dots-signal".<br><br>&nbsp; The only more substantial request to IANA is to update the "DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Key Values" from <br>&nbsp; the "Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel" IANA Registry, that was created by <a href="/doc/rfc8782/">RFC 8782</a>.<br>&nbsp; The request is to reserve a range of one-octet CBOR Key Values for "comprehension-optional" keys.<br>&nbsp; The registration policy for this range is IETF Review.<br><br>&nbsp; Requests to IANA are consistent with document's body.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>&nbsp; No new registries are defined by this document.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; The automated checks of YANG module done via datatracker showed no validation errors or warnings.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>&nbsp; The YANG module was checked with pyang (2.4.0) and yanglint (1.6.7) tools; no validation errors or warnings were found.<br><br></div></td>
