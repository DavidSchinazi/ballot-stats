Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC 7049</a>) is a data<br>&nbsp; format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small<br>&nbsp; code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the<br>&nbsp; need for version negotiation.<br><br>&nbsp; The present document makes use of this extensibility to define a<br>&nbsp; number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as two<br>&nbsp; additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp; intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the<br>&nbsp; CBOR tags defined.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; There were two point that could be considered as a controversy.<br>&nbsp; The first if there should be a rule about using big endian or little <br>&nbsp; endian in the case of deterministic encoding. The WG consensus result<br>&nbsp; was no, but that may not reflect the view of all individuals in the <br>&nbsp; working group.<br>&nbsp; Secondly, regarding tag 68 (Uint8ClampedArray):<br>&nbsp; on one side, it was noted that such a tag indicates a property of the<br>&nbsp; processing more than just the item's encoding. On the other side, it was <br>&nbsp; noted that that allows to identify more precisely what the data type<br>&nbsp; is, which is a desirable feature of CBOR, and that this does not <br>&nbsp; differ from other tags such as MIME. In general, this brings up the <br>&nbsp; point of using CBOR tags to identify types of objects in protocols <br>&nbsp; that exists elsewhere in an object oriented system, such as in other<br>&nbsp; standards or other implementations (JavaScript/ES6 for <br>&nbsp; “Uint8ClampedArray”) rather than in JSON. The WG consensus was <br>&nbsp; towards this being a desirable feature, and the tag was kept in the<br>&nbsp; document.<br><br>&nbsp; Another more general note, there exist different perception of <br>&nbsp; usefulness of some of the concepts in the document (such as homogenous<br>&nbsp; arrays).<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; There is no existing implementations of the specifications, as far as<br>&nbsp; I can tell. The document went through several thorough reviews during<br>&nbsp; the time as working group document, including broader community<br>&nbsp; reviews. No expert review was requested, although an expert review was<br>&nbsp; done during early registration of IANA parameters defined in this <br>&nbsp; document.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Francesca Palombini is the Document Shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Alexey Melnikov is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd has reviewed the document and finds it ready<br>&nbsp; for publication. Moreover, the Document Shepherd has kept track<br>&nbsp; of the several reviews of the documents and made sure all comments<br>&nbsp; were addressed.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No broader reviews or from a particular areas are needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd has no such concerns or issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; The author has indicated that he does not know of any additional IPR<br>&nbsp; that needs to be disclosed. (24th of July)<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; The working group consensus behind the document is solid, according<br>&nbsp; to WG last calls, in room feeling during several meetings, and off <br>&nbsp; line discussion.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No threats of appeal or extreme discontent have been made public.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; No ID nits were found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No such criteria apply.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; No downrefs are there.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No RFCs status will be changed by publication of this document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA registration was already done at the time of this review, as <br>&nbsp; a result of early allocation.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; No automated checks were done.<br></div></td>

The WG consensus result<br>&nbsp; was no, but that may not reflect the view of all individuals in the <br>&nbsp; working group.<br>&nbsp; Secondly, regarding tag 68 (Uint8ClampedArray):<br>&nbsp; on one side, it was noted that such a tag indicates a property of the<br>&nbsp; processing more than just the item's encoding. On the other side, it was <br>&nbsp; noted that that allows to identify more precisely what the data type<br>&nbsp; is, which is a desireable feature of CBOR, and that this does not <br>&nbsp; differ from other tags such as MIME. In general, this brings up the <br>&nbsp; point of using CBOR tags to identify types of objects in protocols <br>&nbsp; that exists elsewhere in an object oriented system, such as in other<br>&nbsp; standards or other implementations (JavaScript/ES6 for <br>&nbsp; “Uint8ClampedArray”) rather than in JSON.

The WG consensus result<br>&nbsp; was no, but that may not reflect the view of all individuals in the <br>&nbsp; working group.<br>&nbsp; Secondly, regarding tag 68 (Uint8ClampedArray):<br>&nbsp; on one side, it was noted that such a tag indicates a property of the<br>&nbsp; processing more than just the item's encoding. On the other side, it was <br>&nbsp; noted that that allows to identify more precisely what the data type<br>&nbsp; is, which is a desireable feature of CBOR, and that this does not <br>&nbsp; differ from other tags such as MIME. In general, this brings up the <br>&nbsp; point of using CBOR tags to identify types of objects in protocols <br>&nbsp; that exists elsewhere in an object oriented system, such as in other<br>&nbsp; standards or other implementations (JavaScript/ES6 for <br>&nbsp; “Uint8ClampedArray”) rather than in JSON. The WG consensus was <br>&nbsp; towards this being a desirable feature, and the tag was kept in the<br>&nbsp; document.<br><br>&nbsp; Another more general note, there exist different perception of <br>&nbsp; usefulness of some of the concepts in the document (such as homogenous<br>&nbsp; arrays).<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; There is no existing implementations of the specifications, as far as<br>&nbsp; I can tell.

(24th of July)<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; The working group consensus behind the document is solid, according<br>&nbsp; to WG last calls, in room feeling during several meetings, and off <br>&nbsp; line discussion.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No threats of appeal or extreme discontent have been made public.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; No ID nits were found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No such criteria apply.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; No downrefs are there.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No RFCs status will be changed by publication of this document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA registration was already done at the time of this review, as <br>&nbsp; a result of early allocation.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; No such new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; No automated checks were done.<br></div></td>
