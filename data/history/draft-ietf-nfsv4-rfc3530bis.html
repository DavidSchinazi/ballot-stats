That's not<br>really going in the right direction from the POV of this<br>reader. I'd encourage the WG to consider re-factoring the NFS<br>documentation into more digestable chunks at some point.<br>(While fully realising the huge and thankless effort that would<br>involve.) At some point, making these RFCs bigger and bigger is<br>going to by itself break something.<br><br>- 1.5: The move away from lipkey and spkm is quite reasonable.<br><br>- 3.3.1 - SECINFO is no longer "new" since that text hasn't<br>changed since 3530:-)<br><br>- 5.9: What does "kerberized" mean? If you mean "uses Kerberos"<br>then saying that would be better than inventing a new term.&nbsp; If<br>it means something else, then I'm not sure what.<br><br>- 6.2.1 says: "Therefore servers should accept every ACL that<br>they can without compromising security." I know what you mean,<br>but I'm not sure if it's possible to implement that, in<br>general. Wouldn't it be possible to say some more about what a<br>server has to implement?<br><br>- 10.4.1, last para: (This was a DISCUSS on -26, but is now a<br>comment based on Tom's response) "making private copies" of<br>credentials sounds odd.&nbsp; I assume you mean kerberos tickets but<br>I'm not sure how that can work. I'd also guess its security<br>mechanism specific.&nbsp; Doesn't that need either some more text or<br>to just say that it doesn't work? Or am I confused? (Quite<br>possible;-)<br><br>And Tom said:<br><br>"Actually, it simply means UID and GID here.<br><br>As an example, there are scenarios in Solaris where when pages<br>get flushed to disk, the UID and GID from the original system<br>write have been lost and the page goes across the wire with<br>root credentials. This can be okay on a local file system but<br>not on a remote one."<br><br>So I think making that clear would be good or just not saying<br>those are credentials.<br><br>- section 17 says: "...the translation SHOULD be done in a<br>secure manner that preserves the integrity of the translation."<br>I don't know how that SHOULD turns into code - does 5.9 really<br>tell me exactly? If not, what's missing in 5.9 and shouldn't<br>that be here? If 5.9 does tell me exactly then I think a more<br>precise reference to the bit of 5.9 that's not a MUST<br>(presumably leading to this SHOULD) is needed.</div></td>

And I'm still utterly amused about the explanation of 2119 words in 12.1, since those definitions are *exactly* how 2119 defines the terms, only in more detail. The "conformance" use that we see in other documents nowadays, that this section is trying to distinguish itself from, is not what 2119 says.<br><br>But as I said, a fine job getting it to this point.</div></td>

I'm guessing this term usage is because of rpc_gss_svc_privacy.&nbsp; It might be helpful to explain the intended use and then map to the GSS functions.<br><br><br>Section 8.4 - Just as an FYI that does not need to be added to the draft, the location information would also be useful for ESI Data Maps, part of which requires an organization to track each instance of data (along with security protections and other information like retention periods.)</div></td>

So, let me ask some questions.<br><br>Do you mean to reject strings that have characters that are not IDNA-valid according to IDNA2008? That is, do you want to allow or disallow strings that are valid UTF-8 but aren't valid U-labels? Similarly, do you want to reject invalid ASCII LDH-labels or invalid A-labels? Remember, U-labels and A-labels only contain IDNA-valid characters.<br><br>Or, conversely, do you want to use the old NAMEPREP routine from <a href="/doc/rfc3491/">RFC3491</a> and map invalid stuff into valid stuff?<br><br>The text as written doesn't make that clear, and it doesn't do either of those two things correctly, so let me know what you want to happen, and I'll try to help you make it happen.</div></td>

Can you give an example of one of those cases?<br><br>5: In this section, you changed "mandatory attributes" to "REQUIRED attributes" and "recommended attributes" to "RECOMMENDED attributes", and uppercased a bunch of MUSTs, SHOULDs, and MAYs. I'm a bit worried you did this simply because one or more people said "Shouldn't those all be 2119 terms?" without any particular reason, and I'm worried that some of the new uses actually don't make sense. For example, you now have:<br><br>&nbsp;  A server should support as many of the RECOMMENDED attributes as<br>&nbsp;  possible but, by their definition, the server is not required to<br>&nbsp;  support all of them.<br><br>RECOMMENDED, in the 2119 sense, doesn't mean that. RECOMMENDED (like SHOULD) means, "There may be reasons to not do this, but you need to understand the full implications of doing so, because normally this is required for interoperability or to avoid harm." Later in 5.2 you say:<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MAY ask for any of these attributes to be<br>&nbsp;  returned by setting a bit in the GETATTR request but must handle the<br>&nbsp;  case where the server does not return them.&nbsp; A client MAY ask for the<br>&nbsp;  set of attributes the server supports and SHOULD NOT request<br>&nbsp;  attributes the server does not support.<br><br>A client must handle the case where the server doesn't return REQUIRED attributes as well (i.e., a client can't just crash because a server is broken). It sounds to me like these RECOMMENDED attributes are really OPTIONAL in the 2119 sense. (They might be "recommended" in the informal sense, as I think you had it before, but 2119 terms muck up the issue.) Also, it seems to me that a client MUST NOT request attributes that the server does not support, not SHOULD NOT.<br><br>I'm not convinced this improved the document.<br><br>5.9:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  For example, the DNS domain name might be "<a href="http://lab.example.org">lab.example.org</a>", but the<br>&nbsp;  user names are defined in "<a href="http://example.org">example.org</a>".<br>&nbsp;  <br>This is written ambiguously. I think you mean<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  For example, the DNS domain name of the host running the NFS server<br>&nbsp;  might be...".<br><br>I don't think the following is helpful:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  Internationalization issues (for a general discussion of which see<br>&nbsp;  Section 12) make this impossible and the client needs to take note of<br>&nbsp;  the following situations:<br><br>I think you should simply refer to section 12 and not give the examples here:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Internationalization issues make this impossible under certain<br>&nbsp;  circumstances and the client needs to take note of these. See Section<br>&nbsp;  12 for a detailed discussion of these issues.<br>&nbsp;  <br>8.2, third paragraph: s/whether it has moved or not/whether it has moved or simply never existed<br><br>9.8, fourth paragraph: I don't know how to implement a "MUST NOT assume". Change back to "may not" or make it "can not", or explain exactly what it is that a client MUST NOT do as a result of a failed operation.<br><br>10.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  However, the time allowed for<br>&nbsp;  recall completion SHOULD NOT be unbounded.<br><br>That's not a very helpful normative requirement. I don't see why you changed it to such a thing.<br><br>12ff: Generally, excellent work. Thanks for this.<br><br>12.1 makes me laugh a little, since those definitions are *exactly* how 2119 defines the terms, only in more detail. The "conformance" use that we see in other documents nowadays, that this section is trying to distinguish itself from, is not what 2119 says.<br><br>12.3 (editorial): This sentence is repeated twice: "Such servers ignore normalization-related issues and there is no way for them to implement either normalization or representation-independent lookups."<br><br>12.4: I don't understand the reference to 2279.

If the client does its part without sending an ACCESS operation (MAY makes that optional), then isn't it in contradiction with the previous paragraph, which says "Clients SHOULD NOT do their own access checks based on their interpretation the ACL, but rather use the OPEN and ACCESS operations to do access checks." ?<br><br>2.

I cannot say that reading it is easy, but it is an important and necessary specification. It is particularly important to revise specifications based on experience. So thank you for doing this hard work.<br><br>I do have a couple of issues that I would like to discuss before recommending the document be approved, however.<br><br>First, there seems to be advice in S6.3.1.2 that I don't know how I could implement. The advice seems even contradictory:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clients SHOULD NOT do their own access checks based on their	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; interpretation the ACL, but rather use the OPEN and ACCESS operations	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to do access checks.&nbsp; This allows the client to act on the results of	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; having the server determine whether or not access should be granted	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on its interpretation of the ACL.	<br> 		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clients must be aware of situations in which an object's ACL will	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; define a certain access even though the server will not enforce it.	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In general, but especially in these situations, the client needs to	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; do its part in the enforcement of access as defined by the ACL.&nbsp; To	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; do this, the client MAY send the appropriate ACCESS operation prior	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to servicing the request of the user or application in order to	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; determine whether the user or application should be granted the	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; access requested.&nbsp; For examples in which the ACL may define accesses	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that the server doesn't enforce see Section 6.3.1.1.<br><br>Secondly, Martin Thomson raised a general issue that relates to the above, in his Gen-ART review. He said:<br><br>The document uses lowercase "must" and "may" a lot.&nbsp; It's not<br>clear whether these are intended to be interpreted as normative<br>statements or not.&nbsp; To my eyes, most of these are.&nbsp; On the other hand,<br>there are places where 2119 language is used to effectively specify<br>implementation details that aren't observable at a protocol level.<br>If the document weren't so large, I'd suggest that the editors go through<br>and make sure that every 2119 keyword is in uppercase and then to<br>check each and every instance.<br><br>I agree with this, and would like to ask the authors if they have gone over the specification and ensured that keywords are used where they are needed. I'm asking in part because the first issue that I raised above depends a bit on the interpretation of the "must" in the second paragraph. To be exact, I am not pointing to other cases in the document that would be faulty, or even claiming that this one is. But I am asking a question if the authors feel a keyword check pass would be useful.<br><br>Third, I cannot find a response to Martin's review from the WG or the authors. I would like to ensure that you have seen the review and have either planned to take it into account, have already taken it into account, or after analysis, decided that no changes are needed. Please confirm.<br><br>Fourth, is there a response for Elwyn's review? See above.<br><br>Fifth, I would like the concept of inheritance explained at the conceptual level and up front. Elwyn made some comments on this, and I tried to understand the document from that perspective, but failed to find a full description. The WG probably has a model in mind, but for the rest of us this should be written up explicitly (and it may not need more than a paragraph). Elwyn wrote:<br><br>The intended functionality of inheritance is not explicitly documented.&nbsp; To come to any sort of understanding of how inheritance is supposed to work you have to read through to the next to the last section (s6.4.3).&nbsp; I have now read through the section two or three times and I have a model in my mind, but there is no text that would allow me to verify my understanding.&nbsp; I *think* i have understood that (1) inheritance only applies when you initially create an object rather than being fed through to all 'inferior' objects in the tree if a superior object has a heritable ACE added; (2) inheritance only applies if you don't explicitly give any ACEs when the object is created, and (3) if you give a mode but no ACL then some complex combination of inherited ACL and mode is applied.&nbsp; An upfront explanation of what is trying to be achieved would have helped a lot.&nbsp; However, none of this explains what happens with either hard or symbolic links.&nbsp; It is unclear to me whether inheritance of ACLs is applied when creating a hard or symbolic link to an existing object.<br><br>Sixth, are there inconsistencies in error codes? Elwyn reported these:<br><br>s13.1.4.2: Value of NFS4ERR_DQUOT is 19 here but 69 in table 8 (seems ok in -26)<br>s13,1.4.11: Value of NFS4ERR_NXIO is 5 here but 6 in table 8 (and value 5 is already used for NFS4ERR_IO).<br>s13.1.5.2: Value of NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID is 10026 here but 10025 in table 8 (and value 10026 is already used for NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID).<br><br>Seventh, in general the number of issues seems to indicate that maybe another checking pass through the document, for consistency and other reasons would be preferable. Even if it is painful for such a big document.</div></td>

I cannot say that reading it is easy, but it is an important and necessary specification. It is particularly important to revise specifications based on experience. So thank you for doing this hard work.<br><br>I do have a couple of issues that I would like to discuss before recommending the document be approved, however.<br><br>First, there seems to be advice in S6.3.1.2 that I don't know how I could implement. The advice seems even contradictory:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clients SHOULD NOT do their own access checks based on their	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; interpretation the ACL, but rather use the OPEN and ACCESS operations	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to do access checks.&nbsp; This allows the client to act on the results of	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; having the server determine whether or not access should be granted	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; based on its interpretation of the ACL.	<br> 		<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Clients must be aware of situations in which an object's ACL will	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; define a certain access even though the server will not enforce it.	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In general, but especially in these situations, the client needs to	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; do its part in the enforcement of access as defined by the ACL.&nbsp; To	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; do this, the client MAY send the appropriate ACCESS operation prior	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to servicing the request of the user or application in order to	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; determine whether the user or application should be granted the	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; access requested.&nbsp; For examples in which the ACL may define accesses	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that the server doesn't enforce see Section 6.3.1.1.<br><br>Secondly, Martin Thomson raised an issue that relates to the above, in his Gen-ART review. He said:<br><br>General: The document uses lowercase "must" and "may" a lot.&nbsp; It's not<br>clear whether these are intended to be interpreted as normative<br>statements or not.&nbsp; To my eyes, most of these are.&nbsp; On the other hand,<br>there are places where 2119 language is used to effectively specify<br>implementation details that aren't observable at a protocol level.<br>If the document weren't so large, I'd suggest that the editors go through<br>and make sure that every 2119 keyword is in uppercase and then to<br>check each and every instance.<br><br>I agree with this, and would like to ask the authors if they have gone over the specification and ensured that keywords are used where they are needed. I'm asking in part because the first issue that I raised above depends a bit on the interpretation of the "must" in the second paragraph. To be exact, I am not pointing to other cases in the document that would be faulty, or even claiming that this one is. But I am asking a question if the authors feel a keyword check pass would be useful.</div></td>

I've tried to go through and pick out individual problems, but at base it's hard for me to imagine how this could possibly be interoperable: There are strings (USHOULD and UVSHOULD) defined by the spec essentially as 'could be UTF-8, but might not be'. That's not a good start.<br><br>I'm also not convinced that this section got sufficient review. The draft did not get noticed by the PRECIS WG list, and the only person on the PRECIS list who reports having reviewed this section in detail is David Black. The apps-discuss list review was "less than thorough" (and I apologize for that). I think this section should be passed by the PRECIS list for further review. Our experience, post IDNA2003, is that the kinds of normalizations done for stringprep in IDNA was generally a mistake and we are working on ways for other protocols to avoid those mistakes.<br><br>Even though <a href="/doc/rfc2277/">RFC 2277</a> says that we should go with UTF-8, if there is legacy of this sort, I would argue it is better to stick with the legacy and label it (just as we do with email) instead of "half" switching to UTF-8 and making implementers hope it all works. My understanding of the recent discussion on the mailing list is that neither the 3530 internationalization nor this one have actually been implemented properly. That's further indication, in my book, that this proposal is simply not going to be interoperable as it stands.<br><br>Some specific worries:<br><br>12.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  Where a UTF-8 string is used as a file name component, the file<br>&nbsp;  system implementation MUST NOT return NFS4ERR_BADNAME, simply due to<br>&nbsp;  a normalization mismatch.&nbsp; In such cases the implementation SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  convert the string to its own preferred normalization mode before<br>&nbsp;  performing the operation.&nbsp; As a result, a client cannot assume that a<br>&nbsp;  file created with a name it specifies will have that name when the<br>&nbsp;  directory is read.&nbsp; It may have instead, the name converted to the<br>&nbsp;  file system's preferred normalization form.<br><br>A call silently succeeding without signal back to the client that the name has been changed seems destined for non-interoperability.<br><br>12.7.1.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; One alternate character repertoire is to represent file name<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; components as strings of bytes with no protocol-defined encoding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of multi-byte characters.<br><br>Unlabeled multi-byte characters are by their nature non-interoperable because of the lack of label. A client supporting UTF-8 names has no way to pass something to the application that can be reasonably manipulated by a user.<br><br>12.7.1.5.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Implement normalization-sensitive handling without enforcing a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; normalization form constraint on file names.&nbsp; This exposes the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; client to the possibility that two files can be created in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same directory which have different names which map to the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; name when normalized.&nbsp; This may be a significant issue when<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clients which use different normalization forms are used on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same file system, but this issue needs to be set against the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; difficulty of providing other sorts of normalization handling for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some existing file systems.<br><br>Allowing servers to normalize at all worries me, but this option being available to the server is pretty scary from a client perspective. 12.7.1.5.2 pretty much expresses this problem.<br><br>I think we should discuss the best way forward.</div></td>

However, given that people have not yet implemented some of the newer items, doing the corrections/clean up to the main body only and putting the entirely independent and new sections into separate documents first and then incorporating them at some point down the road would have kept the reviewing task much easier and would have made it easier to check implementations for interoperability down the road. For instance, I really see no reason that sections 7 and 12 couldn't have been pulled out into their own documents.

I think it would be better for all of these entries to simply have a reference to section 12 (or specifically 12.2.2) in each of the entries and leave the explanations for later. (It might be worth moving section 12 earlier in the document as well.)<br><br>5: In this section, you changed "mandatory attributes" to "REQUIRED attributes" and "recommended attributes" to "RECOMMENDED attributes", and uppercased a bunch of MUSTs, SHOULDs, and MAYs. I'm a bit worried you did this simply because one or more people said "Shouldn't those all be 2119 terms?" without any particular reason, and I'm worried that some of the new uses actually don't make sense. For example, you now have:<br><br>&nbsp;  A server should support as many of the RECOMMENDED attributes as<br>&nbsp;  possible but, by their definition, the server is not required to<br>&nbsp;  support all of them.<br><br>RECOMMENDED, in the 2119 sense, doesn't mean that. RECOMMENDED (like SHOULD) means, "There may be reasons to not do this, but you need to understand the full implications of doing so, because normally this is required for interoperability or to avoid harm." Later in 5.2 you say:<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MAY ask for any of these attributes to be<br>&nbsp;  returned by setting a bit in the GETATTR request but must handle the<br>&nbsp;  case where the server does not return them.&nbsp; A client MAY ask for the<br>&nbsp;  set of attributes the server supports and SHOULD NOT request<br>&nbsp;  attributes the server does not support.<br>&nbsp;  <br>A client must handle the case where the server doesn't return REQUIRED attributes as well (i.e., a client can't just crash because a server is broken). It sounds to me like these RECOMMENDED attributes are really OPTIONAL in the 2119 sense. (They might be "recommended" in the informal sense, as I think you had it before, but 2119 terms muck up the issue.) Also, it seems to me that a client MUST NOT request attributes that the server does not support, not SHOULD NOT.<br><br>Also in 5.1 I see:<br><br>&nbsp;  A client may ask for any of these attributes<br>&nbsp;  to be returned by setting a bit in the GETATTR request, and the<br>&nbsp;  server must return their value.<br><br>The first "may" is lowercase, which is different than what you did in 5.2, and I suspect they should both be lowercase. But the "must return their value" sounds like it should be a "MUST return their value."<br><br>I'm not convinced this improved the document.<br><br>5.9:<br><br>&nbsp;  To avoid a representation that is tied to a particular<br>&nbsp;  underlying implementation at the client or server, the use of the<br>&nbsp;  UTF-8 string has been chosen.<br><br>I know this was in 3530, but I was really confused by this. I think you simply mean: "UTF-8 was chosen to avoid a representation that is tied to a particular implementation at the client or server."<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, the DNS domain name might be "<a href="http://lab.example.org">lab.example.org</a>", but the<br>&nbsp;  user names are defined in "<a href="http://example.org">example.org</a>".<br><br>This is written ambiguously. I think you mean, "For example, the DNS domain name of the host running the NFS server might be...".<br><br>&nbsp;  Internationalization issues (for a general discussion of which see<br>&nbsp;  Section 12) make this impossible and the client needs to take note of<br>&nbsp;  the following situations:<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think you should simply refer to section 12 and not give the examples here: "Internationalization issues make this impossible under certain circumstances and the client needs to take note of these.

Why is<br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>	These documents are candidates for Proposed Standard RFCs.<br><br>	As the title suggests, these are bis documents for <a href="/doc/rfc3530/">RFC3530</a><br>	which itself is of Proposed Standard status.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>	The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed<br>	filesystem protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol<br>	version 2, <a href="/doc/rfc1094/">RFC 1094</a>, and version 3, <a href="/doc/rfc1813/">RFC 1813</a>.&nbsp; Unlike earlier<br>	versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file<br>	access while integrating support for file locking and the<br>	mount protocol.&nbsp; In addition, support for strong security (and<br>	its negotiation), compound operations, client caching, and<br>	internationalization have been added.&nbsp; Of course, attention<br>	has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an<br>	Internet environment.<br><br>	This document, together with the companion XDR description<br>	document, RFCNFSv4XDR, replaces <a href="/doc/rfc3530/">RFC 3530</a> as the definition of<br>	the NFS version 4 protocol.<br><br>	This document includes updates that address: reported errata,<br>	clarifications related to implementation experience, and<br>	expanded text included from other sources.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>	These documents have been very non-controversial given the<br>	nature of the included errata and the fact that most of the<br>	document updates were drawn from the NFSv4.1 definition.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>	The quality of this document is very high.&nbsp; There are multiple<br>	implementations of the mandatory features of the protocol and<br>	at least one implementation covering most (if not all)<br>	optional features.&nbsp; The reason for doing the update was to<br>	raise the overall quality through expanded explanatory text<br>	and correcting ambiguities.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>	The document shepherd has done a full review of the documents<br>	and they are ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>	No special review is needed.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>	Not applicable.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>	No additional IPR has been filed for this "bis" work.<br>	Original IPR for <a href="/doc/rfc3010/">RFC3010</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc3530/">RFC3530</a> (if present) still apply.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>	See (7).<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>	Full working group consensus.&nbsp; No issues exist.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>	Not applicable.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough.<br><br>	No ID nits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>	Not applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>	Yes, appropriate references align with appropriate<br>	normative and informative use.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>	All normative references are published with the exception of<br>	the companion internet draft: "NFSv4 Version 0 XDR Description"<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>	Not applicable.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc3530/">RFC3530</a> will be obsolete.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>	The IANA has been reviewed and been found to meet the<br>	necessary requirements.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>	IANA registries do not require expert review.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>	Not applicable.<br><br></div></td>
