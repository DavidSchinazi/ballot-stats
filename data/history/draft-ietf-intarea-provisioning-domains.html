 Similarly, hosts MUST associate all network configuration objects<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., default routers, addresses, more specific routes, DNS<br>&nbsp;  Recursive Resolvers) with the PvD associated with the RA which last<br>&nbsp;

For any given<br>configuration object, there will be an RA which has most-recently<br>updated that object ("last updated the object"); that RA has some<br>associated PvD, whether via explicit PvD ID option or assignment of<br>implicit PvD.&nbsp; It sounds like this is telling me to associate the object<br>with the aforementioned PvD, so that "last PvD wins" for any given<br>object, but this seems at odds with the idea of having multiple PvDs<br>active at once, with separate configurations.&nbsp;

If so, they will<br>not be provisioning recursive DNS servers via RA options, and thus are<br>not covered by any of the items in this listing.<br><br>&nbsp;  In all of these cases, the recursive DNS server addresses SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  associated with the corresponding PvD.&nbsp; Specifically, queries sent to<br>&nbsp;  a configured recursive DNS server SHOULD be sent from a local IP<br>&nbsp;  address that was provisioned by the PvD via RA or DHCP.&nbsp; Answers<br><br>nit: are they provisioned "by" the PvD" or "with"/"for" the PvD?<br><br>&nbsp;  PvD-aware applications will be able to select which PvD(s) to use for<br>&nbsp;  DNS resolution and connections, which allows them to effectively use<br>&nbsp;  multiple Explicit PvDs.&nbsp; In order to support non-PvD-aware<br>&nbsp;  applications, however, PvD-aware hosts SHOULD ensure that non-PvD-<br>&nbsp;  aware name resolution APIs like "getaddrinfo" only use resolvers from<br>&nbsp;  a single PvD for each query.&nbsp; Handling DNS across PvDs is discussed<br><br>just to check: this SHOULD is only at a per-API-call level, and<br>subsequent calls to getaddrinfo (even with the same arguments) are<br>permitted to use results from different PvDs?&nbsp; I would have naievly<br>expected that the "default PvD" used for such non-PvD-aware applications<br>would be relatively stable over time...<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  This JSON object is restricted to the restricted profile of I-JSON,<br>&nbsp;  as defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7493/">RFC7493</a>].<br><br>nit: I-JSON is a restricted profile of JSON, but does not itself has a<br>"restricted profile" subset, so I'd suggest just "is restricted to the<br>I-JSON profile".<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the DNS name resolution of the PvD ID, the PKI (Public Key<br>&nbsp;  Infrastructure) checks as well as the actual query MUST be performed<br>&nbsp;  using the considered PvD.&nbsp; In other words, the name resolution, PKI<br><br>nit(?): I am not sure if these "PKI checks" are supposed to be DNSSEC or<br>the TLS validation.&nbsp; I don't think we previously discussed having<br>separate per-PvD TLS trust anchors, which mostly leads me to assume<br>DNSSEC PKI, but greater clarity in the document would be welcome.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the HTTP status of the answer is greater than or equal to 400 the<br>&nbsp;  host MUST abandon and consider that there is no additional PvD<br>&nbsp;  information.&nbsp; If the HTTP status of the answer is between 300 and<br><br>nit: "abandon" is a transitive verb and requires an object.<br><br>&nbsp;  399, inclusive, it MUST follow the redirection(s).&nbsp; If the HTTP<br>&nbsp;  status of the answer is between 200 and 299, inclusive, the host MAY<br>&nbsp;  get a file containing a single JSON object.<br><br>Is redirect-chasing recursive or one-time?<br>I agree with Alissa that this "MAY" is not normatiave.<br><br>&nbsp;  After retrieval of the PvD Additional Information, hosts MUST<br>&nbsp;  remember the last Sequence Number value received in the RA including<br>&nbsp;  the same PvD ID.&nbsp; Whenever a new RA for the same PvD is received with<br><br>nit: s/the RA/an RA/<br><br>&nbsp;  a different Sequence Number value, or whenever the expiry date for<br>&nbsp;  the additional information is reached, hosts MUST deprecate the<br>&nbsp;  additional information and stop using it until a new JSON object is<br>&nbsp;  retrieved.<br><br>Is this really just "a different Sequence Number value" or do we want "a<br>larger Sequence Number value"?&nbsp; If the former, then it's not really<br>functioning as a *sequence* number, is it?<br>Also, is the "until [...]" clause really needed?&nbsp; Regardless of whether<br>new additional information is retrieved (and validated), *this*<br>additional information is still not being used.<br><br>nit: if we are going to say "uniformly random" for the [(B-A)/2,B]<br>interval, we should probably also use "uniformly" for the "random time<br>between zero and 2**(Delay * 2) milliseconds".<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the 'Delay' value is directly within the PvD Option rather than<br>&nbsp;  the object itself, an operator may perform a push-based update by<br>&nbsp;  incrementing the Sequence value while changing the Delay value<br><br>nit: "Sequence Number"<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  RA by the network operator.&nbsp; In particular, when a captive portal is<br>&nbsp;  present, hosts MUST still be allowed to perform DNS, PKI and HTTP<br>&nbsp;  over TLS operations related to the retrieval of the object, even<br>&nbsp;  before logging into the captive portal.<br><br>I assume "DNS" here means "DNS over UDP(/TCP) on port 53 in the<br>traditional, unencrypted, protocol of <a href="/doc/std13/">STD 13</a>"?&nbsp; It may be prudent to be<br>clear about the expectations here.<br><br>&nbsp;  Routers SHOULD increment the PVD Option Sequence Number by one<br>&nbsp;  whenever a new PvD Additional Information object is available and<br>&nbsp;  should be retrieved by hosts.&nbsp; If the value exceeds what can be<br>&nbsp;  stored in the Sequence Number field, it SHOULD wrap back to zero.<br><br>Why are these just "SHOULD"?<br><br>&nbsp;  The server providing the JSON files SHOULD also check whether the<br>&nbsp;  client address is part of the prefixes listed into the additional<br>&nbsp;  information and SHOULD return a 403 response code if there is no<br>&nbsp;  match.<br><br>(I assume that the "SHOULD" is to allow for exceptions when NAT-shaped<br>things are in use.)<br>nit: "is part of" is perhaps a bit odd<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>[perhaps update the example "expires" value to something slightly more<br>current, both here and in 4.3.1?]<br><br>&nbsp;

 When a host retrieves the PvD Additional Information, it MUST verify<br>&nbsp;  that the TLS server certificate is valid for the performed request<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., that the Subject Alternative Name is equal to the PvD ID<br>&nbsp;  expressed as an FQDN).&nbsp; This authentication creates a secure binding<br>&nbsp;  between the information provided by the trusted Router Advertisement,<br><br>What makes an RA "trusted"?<br><br>&nbsp;  and the HTTPS server.&nbsp; However, this does not mean the Advertising<br>&nbsp;  Router and the PvD server belong to the same entity.<br><br>Can you give me an example of when they would not be part of the same<br>entity?&nbsp; I can only partially see how that would happen.<br><br>I see there's some discussion of client IPv4 addresses here, but note<br>that the "prefixes" entry in the additional information is specifically<br>limited to IPv6 prefixes.&nbsp; Does the prefix check just not work at all<br>for IPv4, or we know that NAT44 is too prevalent for it to be worth<br>trying, or ...?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>Do you want to also mention that some fields (e.g., Sequence Number) are<br>only listed when relevant, and/or provide default values for the<br>examples when they are not explicitly listed?<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  In the above example, non-PvD-aware hosts will only use the first RA<br>&nbsp;  sent from their default router and using the 2001:db8:cafe::/64<br>&nbsp;  prefix.&nbsp; PvD-aware hosts will autonomously configure addresses from<br><br>nit(?): I can't decide whether "from" or "for" is intended in "from<br>their default router".<br><br>&nbsp;  both PIOs, but will only use the source address in 2001:db8:f00d::/64<br>&nbsp;  to communicate past the first hop router since only the router<br>&nbsp;  sending the second RA will be used as default router; similarly, they<br>&nbsp;  will use the DNS server 2001:db8:f00d::53 when communicating with<br>&nbsp;  this address.<br><br>nit: I'm not sure I understand what "communicating with this address" is<br>intended to mean (it would make more sense to me as "communicating from<br>this adddress").<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; RA Header: router lifetime = 1600 (PvD-aware hosts will use<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  this router as a default router), implicit length = 2<br><br>just to check my understanding: this is only "use as a default router"<br>within the scope of this PvD (and will use the other RA's data as<br>default router for the other PvD)?&nbsp; I'd perhaps consider adding "for<br>this PvD", though it's far from clear that such clarification in the<br>text is needed.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>This RA Option can include other RA Options; we should probably note<br>that the security considerations of the included options continue to<br>apply.<br><br>When RAs have to be split to avoid exceeding the link MTU, there is<br>perhaps some scope for selective packet blocking to influence host<br>behavior (by denying them some of the PvD-specific configuration),<br>though of course such attacks are pretty challenging on a local<br>network/link.<br><br>Attacks to block attempts to retrieve the additional information are<br>more likely succeed, though the scope is perhaps limited since all that<br>stuff is supposed to be optional.&nbsp; We can't really limit what vendors<br>will do with it, though, so we should probably treat it as having some<br>significant risk of DoS.<br><br>Expiration times are represented as absolute times, so the usual<br>considerations about accurate time and clock skew apply.<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification does not improve the Neighbor Discovery Protocol<br>&nbsp;  security model, but extends the purely link-local trust relationship<br>&nbsp;  between the host and the default routers with HTTP over TLS<br>&nbsp;  communications which servers are authenticated as rightful owners of<br>&nbsp;  the FQDN received within the trusted PvD ID RA option.<br><br>I think I need some more persuasion to believe that the routers are<br>actually "authenticated as rightful owners of the FQDN received" as<br>claimed here.&nbsp; In light of the following paragraph in the text, perhaps<br>we should say something more like "validates that the owner of the FQDN<br>authorizes its use with the prefix advertised by the router" and "in<br>combination with implicit trust in the local router (if present), this<br>gives the host some level of assurance that the PvD is authorized for<br>use in this environment.&nbsp; However, when the local router cannot be<br>trusted, no such guarantee is available."<br><br>&nbsp;  Users cannot be assumed to be able to meaningfully differentiate<br>&nbsp;  between "safe" and "unsafe" networks.&nbsp; This is a known attack surface<br>&nbsp;  that is present whether or not PvDs are in use, and hence cannot be<br>&nbsp;  addressed by this document.&nbsp; However, a host that correctly<br>&nbsp;  implements the multiple PvD architecture ([<a href="/doc/rfc7556/">RFC7556</a>]) using the<br>&nbsp;  mechanism described in this document will be less susceptible to such<br>&nbsp;  attacks than a host that does not by being able to check for the<br>&nbsp;  various misconfigurations described in this document.<br><br>I think this is only true for certain definitions of "safe" and would<br>like to learn more about what definition the authors had in mind when<br>writing this.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Whenever we introduce new identifier (types), the question of privacy<br>considerations arises with respect to tracking of the identified entity<br>or related entities, among other things.&nbsp; The PvD itself here is not<br>really "trackable", so we seem to be concerned only with tracking of<br>devices that connect to /use a given PvD.&nbsp; I'll try to walk through the<br>workflow to confirm that there's not more that needs to be said here:<br>Generally, a host is going to mostly just be receiving the PvD ID value,<br>and not broadcasting it in much outgoing traffic.&nbsp; It would perhaps get<br>some configuration about PvD IDs in some area (though configured PvD IDs<br>seems more likeoy on routers than hosts), and receives PvD IDs via RA<br>options, and uses the PvD ID to correlate/associate information across<br>RAs, potentially across networks and mobility events.&nbsp; The only time I<br>see the PvD ID being sent outbound from a PvD-aware host is in the query<br>to the PvD's well-known URI for additional information, and we say that<br>the DNS resolution used to look up that name must be from the same<br>configuration that claims to use that PvD. This is done with the intent<br>that there's no additional information leakage, as we're essentially<br>just echoing back the PvD ID to the same administrative entity that gave<br>it to us.&nbsp; For honest routers it clearly should work fine, but what<br>happens if we have dishonest routers?&nbsp; A dishonest router could send an<br>RA claiming a different/bogus PvD ID, and an honest host as specified<br>here would then go ahead and make the DNS+HTTPS query for additional<br>information, which is still just echoing back the value that was sent,<br>to who sent it.&nbsp; There would only be some additional information leakage<br>if the host was configured to be selective about which PvDs to fetch<br>additional information for, so that the attacker could check whether a<br>given PvD ID was on the whitelist or not.&nbsp; I think, though, that even if<br>a host does have a whitelist of PvD IDs it will use, there's still no<br>harm from always fetching the additional information and just discarding<br>it for non-whitelisted PvDs -- that lets such a host blend into the<br>genera population of PvD-aware hosts without directly revealing that it<br>has a whitelist or the contents thereof.&nbsp; (Its subsequent network<br>traffic might still give some implicit signal, though that's perhaps<br>less conclusive.)<br><br>I don't have a great sense of how (un)likely host-leve PvD whitelists<br>are to be seen in practice, and thus whether it's worth putting the<br>above advice/analysis (just the "to blend in, always fetch even if you<br>ignore" part) into the document.&nbsp; Given that we do mention<br>FQDN/IP-prefix whitelists, I'm leaning towards including this aspect as<br>well.<br><br>(The above analysis changes some if a host is going to be caching any<br>PvD-specific information across mobility events within the same PvD, but<br>I don't see much to indicate that such long-term caching would occur.)<br><br>&nbsp;  default router, this property can't be ensured.&nbsp; Therefore, hosts<br>&nbsp;  willing to retrieve the PvD Additional Information before using it<br>&nbsp;  without leaking identity information, SHOULD make use of an IPv6<br><br>nit: this is either tautological or not saying what it's intended to,<br>since it's impossible to use the information without having first<br>retrieved it...<br><br>&nbsp;  Privacy Address and SHOULD NOT include any privacy sensitive data,<br>&nbsp;  such as User Agent header or HTTP cookie, while performing the HTTP<br>&nbsp;  over TLS query.<br><br>...so perhaps rephrasing akin to "To minimize the leakage of identity<br>information while retrieving PvD Additional Information, hosts SHOULD<br>[...]" is in order.<br><br>&nbsp;  From a user privacy perspective, retrieving the PvD Additional<br>&nbsp;  Information is not different from establishing a first connection to<br>&nbsp;  a remote server, or even performing a single DNS lookup.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  example, most operating systems already perform early queries to well<br>&nbsp;  known web sites, such as <a href="http://captive.example.com/hotspot-">http://captive.example.com/hotspot-</a><br>&nbsp;  detect.html, in order to detect the presence of a captive portal.<br><br>I understand the desire to only use names/numbers designated as "for<br>example use" in RFCs, but this seems like a case where it might be worth<br>making an exception.<br><br>&nbsp;  Network operators SHOULD restrict access to PvD Additional<br>&nbsp;  Information to only expose it to hosts that are connected to the<br>&nbsp;  local network, especially if the Additional Information would provide<br>&nbsp;  information about local network configuration to attackers.&nbsp; This can<br><br>(It seems that even the existence of a vendor-* subobject might be<br>considered "sensitive" in this fashion.)<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>Is there any additional guidance we wish to give to the Experts?<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;

Is this type of RFC indicated in the title<br>page header?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1a] The type of RFC being requested is Proposed Standard.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1b] This document meets the spirit of <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> section 4.1.1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ("Proposed Standard"); the specification "has resolved known<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  design choices, [and] is believed to be well-understood" though<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "further experience might result in a change...".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1c] The document's title page header states<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Intended Status: Standards Track."<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or<br>introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that<br>there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; A provisioning domain (PVD) is defined as the consistent set of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; network configuration information allowing a node to make use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a network (<a href="/doc/rfc7556/">RFC 7556</a> Section 2).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PVDs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; through a Router Advertisement (RA) option.&nbsp; This RA option announces<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a PVD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; PVDs.&nbsp; The option can directly carry some information about a PVD and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; can optionally point to additional PVD information that can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retrieved using HTTP over TLS.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was<br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where<br>the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There were two key discussions about the PVD Option that informed the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; design.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; First: all necessary (non-optional) data for making consistent use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a network (PVD information) must be transmitted atomically. Use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; existing RA header and options support this (i.e. PIO, RIO, RDNSS).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The atomicity of receiving the minimum required set of information<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; helped establish that there would be no dependency loop on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (supposed to be) optional data.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Second: there should be support for PVD Option-aware and non-aware<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; clients on the same network. This is the origin of the RA option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulating format.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not aware of any non-hackathon implementations.&nbsp; The mobile<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; operating system vendors have indicated their intent to implement.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; At least one network vendor is in the course of implementing, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; has funded some open source Linux kernel work as well.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not aware of any media type review that was requested; the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; media type registration template has been completed in the IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Considerations section.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Erik Kline .<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Responsible Area Director is Suresh Krishnan .<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [3] I have read this document many times during its evolution. For<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; this writeup I have reread it in detail.&nbsp; I have sent some comments<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the authors that I think will clarify several minor issues.&nbsp; I<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; would expect that a -08 version (incorporating the feedback as deemed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate) would be publishable as a proposed standards track<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [4] The general intarea concerns seem to have been hammered out in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the discussion among those that spoke up.&nbsp; It's not clear if others<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the working group have grasped the potential new use cases and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; architectures that this document enables.&nbsp; The authors and active<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussion participants do seem to understand this, of course.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the comments from the SECDIR review of -04 are of interest,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and there may well be future work around signing PVD data with JOSE.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I expect operational experience will motivate and inform such work.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [5] Beyond the directorate reviews and reviews required for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IANA-related issues (questions 17 and 18), no additional review<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; seems to be required.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Operational experience will need to be gained with this proposed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; standard and subsequent documents will likely address the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; management of any complexity that arises.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As mentioned in the SECDIR review, the use of the .well-known URI<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and "vendor-*" PVD JSON keys may need a rethink (I'm not sure, but<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "vendor-*" might fall into the same category as "X-*" vis a vis<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc6648/">RFC 6648</a>. I have no concerns about the use of either of these.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [6] None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [7] All authors have confirmed that they know of no relevant IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and therefore no appropriate IPR disclosures seem necessary.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [8a] A search on the IETF datatracker IPR page for:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?doctitle=provisioning+domains&amp;submit=doctitle">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?doctitle=provisioning+domains&amp;submit=doctitle</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; turned up only 2 IPR claims, neither of which are filed against this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, this document does have an informative reference to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document with an IPR claim (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2722/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2722/</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [8b] Not Applicable.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The document has the solid consensus of those most directly impacted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; by the lack (and, if published, presence) of explicit PvD indicators,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; namely the mobile operating system developers.&nbsp; The document also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; has (at least one) vendor support.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surveying the mailing list archives, there appears to be consensus<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; support and no one raising concerns (technical or otherwise) in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; past year or so.&nbsp; The number of voices in favor are not numerous,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but the number opposing appears to be zero.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Is this type of RFC indicated in the title<br>page header?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1a] The type of RFC being requested is Proposed Standard.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1b] This document meets the spirit of <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> section 4.1.1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ("Proposed Standard"); the specification "has resolved known<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  design choices, [and] is believed to be well-understood" though<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "further experience might result in a change...".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [1c] The document's title page header states<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Intended Status: Standards Track."<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or<br>introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that<br>there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; A provisioning domain (PVD) is defined as the consistent set of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; network configuration information allowing a node to make use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a network (<a href="/doc/rfc7556/">RFC 7556</a> Section 2).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PVDs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; through a Router Advertisement (RA) option.&nbsp; This RA option announces<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a PVD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; PVDs.&nbsp; The option can directly carry some information about a PVD and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; can optionally point to additional PVD information that can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retrieved using HTTP over TLS.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was<br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where<br>the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There were two key discussions about the PVD Option that informed the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; design.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; First: all necessary (non-optional) data for making consistent use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a network (PVD information) must be transmitted atomically. Use of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; existing RA header and options support this (i.e. PIO, RIO, RDNSS).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The atomicity of receiving the minimum required set of information<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; helped establish that there would be no dependency loop on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (supposed to be) optional data.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Second: there should be support for PVD Option-aware and non-aware<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; clients on the same network. This is the origin of the RA option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulating format.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not aware of any non-hackathon implementations.&nbsp; The mobile<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; operating system vendors have indicated their intent to implement.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; At least one network vendor is in the course of implementing, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; has funded some open source Linux kernel work as well.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not aware of any media type review that was requested; the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; media type registration template has been completed in the IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Considerations section.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Erik Kline .<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Responsible Area Director is Suresh Krishnan .<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [3] I have read this document many times during its evolution. For<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; this writeup I have reread it in detail.&nbsp; I have sent some comments<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to the authors that I think will clarify several minor issues.&nbsp; I<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; would expect that a -08 version (incorporating the feedback as deemed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate) would be publishable as a proposed standards track<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [4] The general intarea concerns seem to have been hammered out in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the discussion among those that spoke up.&nbsp; It's not clear if others<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the working group have grasped the potential new use cases and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; architectures that this document enables.&nbsp; The authors and active<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussion participants do seem to understand this, of course.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the comments from the SECDIR review of -04 are of interest,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and there may well be future work around signing PVD data with JOSE.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I expect operational experience will motivate and inform such work.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [5] Beyond the directorate reviews and reviews required for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IANA-related issues (questions 17 and 18), no additional review<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; seems to be required.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Operational experience will need to be gained with this proposed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; standard and subsequent documents will likely address the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; management of any complexity that arises.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As mentioned in the SECDIR review, the use of the .well-known URI<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and "vendor-*" PVD JSON keys may need a rethink (I'm not sure, but<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "vendor-*" might fall into the same category as "X-*" vis a vis<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc6648/">RFC 6648</a>. I have no concerns about the use of either of these.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [6] None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [7] All authors have confirmed that they know of no relevant IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and therefore no appropriate IPR disclosures seem necessary.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [8a] A search on the IETF datatracker IPR page for:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?doctitle=provisioning+domains&amp;submit=doctitle">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/search/?doctitle=provisioning+domains&amp;submit=doctitle</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; turned up only 2 IPR claims, neither of which are filed against this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, this document does have an informative reference to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document with an IPR claim (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2722/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2722/</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [8b] Not Applicable.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The document has the solid consensus of those most directly impacted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; by the lack (and, if published, presence) of explicit PvD indicators,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; namely the mobile operating system developers.&nbsp; The document also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; has (at least one) vendor support.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surveying the mailing list archives, there appears to be consensus<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; support and no one raising concerns (technical or otherwise) in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; past year or so.&nbsp; The number of voices in favor are not numerous,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but the number opposing appears to be zero.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [10] No public indications of opposition, nor are any known privately<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; by me.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [16] No RFCs are updated nor any any obsoleted by this document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.
