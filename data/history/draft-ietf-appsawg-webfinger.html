I hope some implementer input will be solicited to firm section 8 up, but it was exactly what I thought was needed. Some additional comments to consider, none of them earth-shattering:<br><br>Section 1, last paragraph, suggest adding: "Section 8 describes how applications of WebFinger may be defined."<br><br>Section 3, opening paragraph, suggest changing to:<br><br>&nbsp;  This section shows a few sample uses of WebFinger. Any application of<br>&nbsp;  WebFinger would be specified outside of this document, as described<br>&nbsp;  in section 8. The examples in this section should be simple enough to<br>&nbsp;  understand without having seen the formal specifications of the<br>&nbsp;  applications.<br><br>Section 3.2, first paragraph: The use of "application" here sounds like "client application", where elsewhere in the document, "application" refers to the "application of use" defined a la section 8. I suggest changing the first paragraph to:<br><br>&nbsp;  Suppose an application is defined to retrieve metadata information<br>&nbsp;  about a web page URL, such as author and copyright information. To<br>&nbsp;  retrieve that information, a client can utilize WebFinger to issue a<br>&nbsp;  query for the specific URL.&nbsp; Suppose the URL of interest is<br>&nbsp;  <a href="http://blog.example.com/article/id/314">http://blog.example.com/article/id/314</a>.&nbsp; The client would issue a<br>&nbsp;  query similar to the following:<br><br>Section 4:<br><br>&nbsp;  ...the host to which the WebFinger query is issued MUST be the same<br>&nbsp;  as the "host" portion of the query target, unless the client receives<br>&nbsp;  instructions through some out-of-band mechanism to send the query to<br>&nbsp;  another host.<br>&nbsp;  <br>The "MUST...unless" construction is weird. SHOULD seems better anyway (keeping the explanation, and perhaps adding something about URIs that have no "host" portion).<br><br>Section 8.4: Silly grammar-police thing: s/are each comprised of/each comprise/<br><br>Section 8.5:<br><br>&nbsp;  Any syntactically valid properties or links the client receives and<br>&nbsp;  that are not fully understood SHOULD be ignored and MUST NOT cause<br>&nbsp;  the client to report an error.<br><br>I think the MUST NOT should be SHOULD NOT. There are cases I can imagine where I define an application where I know I've got to be talking to a server that really understands the question I'm asking, and if I get bogus properties or links that I don't understand, I want to signal to the user that the server in question isn't playing the right game (i.e., isn't properly implementing the application). I think as a general rule, you SHOULD always ignore unknown stuff and SHOULD NOT generate an error, but I can imagine cases where it would be reasonable.</div></td>

Since nobody else is arguing for<br>this I've made it a comment.<br><br>- 8.2 and 8.3, given the privacy and abuse considerations<br>here why is there no definition for the DELETE method in<br>order to provide a way for users to be able to at least ask<br>that their information no longer be available? Or another<br>.well-known URI could be used. Was that discussed?<br><br><br>---<br><br>- Thank you for requiring TLS! That's a good precedent. <br><br>- intro: "facilitate logging into a web site" hmm, lots of<br>security alarm-bells ring there, maybe better to say<br>"facilitate, with additional security mechanisms, logging<br>into a web site" or choose a non-security example?<br><br>- 3.2, I'd much prefer that the security of this kind of<br>interaction be explained, if only by reference, e.g. add<br>something like "the security aspects of this kind of<br>interaction are discussed in [ref]." If such a [ref] exists<br>then that ought be easy and useful. If no such [ref] exists<br>that would be interesting.<br><br>- 4.1, I'm a bit confused here. Can I use WF to ask about<br>"<a href="http://tcd.ie/thing?foo=bar&amp;baz=bat">http://tcd.ie/thing?foo=bar&amp;baz=bat</a>" as the query target? I<br>think this section says that's ok but I'm not sure so maybe<br>I'm confused. Maybe making that explicit would be good.&nbsp; I'm<br>also not sure that its ok to not percent-encode the "?" in<br>that query target but I guess it must be ok if you've said<br>nothing about it.<br><br>- 4.3, the example "rel"s are http URLs and not https. Are<br>these intended never to be de-referenced?&nbsp; If so, maybe say<br>so and that its therefore ok to not insist on https?&nbsp; If not,<br>then I think you do need to say that de-referencing those<br>URLs can invalidate some of the confidentiality guarantees<br>provided by requiring TLS for WF.<br><br>- 4.4.3, same comment as for 4.3; maybe for 4.4.4.x too<br><br>- section 7 uses the term "service URI" - I think that and<br>"query target" and "subject URI" would be better defined up<br>front<br><br>- 8.1, you don't say if you require certificate status<br>checking.&nbsp; It'd be better to say.<br><br>- 8.2, this is outstandingly glib: "If one does not wish to<br>share certain information with the world, do not allow that<br>information to be freely accessible on the Internet or<br>discoverable via WebFinger" - most users are never given a<br>choice as to whether or not much of their information is<br>freely accessible or not. I think the best that can be done<br>with that is to delete it.</div></td>

I can find nothing in the document that indicates to the client how it shall determine what sort of URI to use is the resource part of the query or what the semantics of any given URI are supposed to be. Indeed, the -13 version of the document adds a paragraph more or less saying that this is intentional:<br><br>&nbsp;  The WebFinger protocol is designed to be used across many<br>&nbsp;  applications.&nbsp; Applications that wish to utilize WebFinger will need<br>&nbsp;  to specify properties, titles, and link relation types that are<br>&nbsp;  appropriate for the application.&nbsp; Further, applications will need to<br>&nbsp;  define the appropriate URI scheme to utilize for the query target.<br><br>I suspect that the semantics are so underspecified that there could not possibly be interoperable implementations without lots of out-of-band information.<br><br>1. The first example provides a mapping from an email address (or perhaps a mailto URI; that's not clear) to an acct URI, but neither the example nor anything in the rest of the document gives any clue why you would choose to query an "acct" URI based on the contents of an email message. I think the assumption is that if there is an email address, there must be some sort of "account" associated with it, and therefore querying the host on the RHS of the "@" for that account will get some interesting information. But I don't see any reason to choose an "acct" scheme over "mailto" or "smtp" or "email" or "foobar"; as far as I can tell, the choice is semantics-free.<br><br>Reading the above alongside 3.3 makes me all the more suspicious: In 3.3 (also mentioned in 4.5), a "mailto" URI gets you configuration information for all email configuration parameters. Does an "acct" URI get you configuration information for email *and* xmpp *and* sip *and* calendaring *and* all other configuration information (since you are no longer asking for a particular protocol, but rather the general account information), or do you only get "information" about the person and not their account? How can the client know what sort of information it can ask for and how to get it? And for that matter, how does the server tell what information to pass back? You'd think there would be a hint about this in 4.3, but "rel" only seems to provide for the client to request those things that the client already knows about it. In particular, there appears to be no way to say, "Give me user provided information, but not config information" or "Give me config information, but not blog entries". If the intention of the document is to ignore this issue and leave it to other documents or just the implementation to define (as implied by the new paragraph in the intro), I'd say that this protocol is not complete and therefore not interoperable.<br><br>2. I disagree with Benoit about the need for Webfinger to return only static info and therefore object to the addition of the text to the intro regarding static vs. dynamic:<br><br>&nbsp;  The information is intended to be static in nature and, as such,<br>&nbsp;  WebFinger is not intended to be used to return dynamic information<br>&nbsp;  like the temperature of a CPU or the current toner level in a laser<br>&nbsp;  printer.<br><br>Benoit's objection is certainly a design preference, but is not appropriate as a DISCUSS and certainly is not an appropriate change to make without WG consensus, which was not obtained. I think it is perfectly reasonable for Webfinger to return dynamic information (indeed, it certainly will in the case of human account information), and this restriction is inappropriate just to satisfy a particular AD's preferences.</div></td>

After discussions, I now understand why a URI might be useful as the resource target of a query. (E.g., I might want to see if there is information about a particular web page that will lead me to its author, etc.) However, I am still a bit confused about why a URI is the *only* thing I can query. The new text on the importance of the host info increases this confusion:<br><br>&nbsp;  The host to which a WebFinger query is issued is significant.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  query target contains a "host" portion (Section 3.2.2 of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a>),<br>&nbsp;  then the host to which the WebFinger query is issued MUST be the same<br>&nbsp;  as the "host" portion of the query target. If the query target does<br>&nbsp;  not contain a "host" portion, then the client MAY choose a host to<br>&nbsp;  which it directs the query based on local policy.<br><br>If the URI need not have a host portion and you can therefore target any host, I don't see why the resource portion of the query needs to be a URI. As I said earlier, it seems reasonable to pass any sort of identifier. (See <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/</a> for example.) If more semantics (beyond rel) are needed, another parameter indicating the type of identifier being used seems much more appropriate than using a URI scheme.<br><br>2. I see no justification for the restriction in the above for querying only the host that is in the host portion of a URI. Please explain.<br><br>3. I agree with Stephen's concerns re: privacy.</div></td>

Some of those are most<br>apparent through the use-cases/examples so I've taken the<br>unusal step of DISCUSSing those since they really seem to<br>convey the real intent of this protocol. To an extent, some<br>of the suggested changes there do represent personal<br>preferences of mine but I believe that the DISCUSSion is<br>still worth having between the authors and IESG and perhaps<br>the WG. <br><br>(1) 3.1, having the MUA automatically do the webfinger thing<br>is a privacy disaster and would cause MUAs to visit sources<br>of spam continually and to expose the email addresses of<br>their correspondents. Other references to having a UA<br>automatically do webfinger also need to be deleted kind of<br>behaviour needs to be the subject of a "MUST NOT" statement<br>IMO. In fact, it already is, since 8.2 says: "WebFinger MUST<br>NOT be used to provide any personal data to any party unless<br>explicitly authorized by the person whose information is<br>being shared." Having a MUA automatically send out a WF<br>request where the query target is the mail sender/from<br>contradicts this requirement. The 3.1 example also fits the<br>anti-pattern given in 8.3. Suggested fix, easy: say that a<br>MUA MUST NOT do the automatic thing, as per 8.2, which would<br>be a fine forward reference.<br><br>(2) 3.3, this example is odd - why should Sue expose her<br>username in this interaction - there's no occurrence of<br>anything clearly user-dependent in the response except what<br>was given in the request. Why should we expose user<br>information unnecessarily in this manner? I think the fix<br>here is for user Sue to send a request for "<a href="mailto:anon@example.com">anon@example.com</a>"<br>and for the text to specifically say that making use of the<br>real username isn't a good plan and making use of an invented<br>non-existent string for username in this case is a fine plan<br>and perhaps even specifying such a "nonexistent" username<br>value that can be supported by and understood by all clients<br>and servers and saying when it'd be sensible to use that.<br><br>(3) 3.4, making devices discoverable like this, esp if device<br>type and firmware revisions were to be exposed represents a<br>significant increase in an existing risk.&nbsp; (We had a recent<br>discussion related to vCard for a similar use case.) This<br>section seems to be too speculative to be honest, so I'd<br>suggest just deleting it. If not, maybe add text like that<br>added in the vCard case. <br><br>(4) cleared<br><br>(5) made this a comment<br><br>(6) cleared</div></td>

In general, this seems like more of a "framework" document than an actual protocol.&nbsp; It concerns me to put something like that on the Standards Track without some plan to add more specificity.&nbsp; As the document stands, it defines a generic system for mapping an octet string to a set of attribute/value pairs.&nbsp; While that level of generality can be useful for building applications, it makes it hard to evaluate the security and privacy implications.&nbsp; I think this is what's at the root of Stephen's DISCUSS points on the examples.&nbsp; If this were part of a working group that were chartered to define details, this would be fine as a first deliverable.&nbsp; But it doesn't really seem to stand on its own.<br><br>Setting those concerns aside for the moment, I have some concerns about the interoperability of this protocol.&nbsp; While the JSON body returned from a query is well specified, the process of making a query is much less so.<br><br>2. Section 4.1. does not actually tell the implementor how to construct a WebFinger URI.&nbsp; A few issues/questions that need to be addressed:<br><br>2.1. What are the inputs to this process?&nbsp; An "acct:" URI and optional "rel" values?<br><br>2.2. How does one choose the host part of the WebFinger URI?<br><br>2.3. The section as it currently stands allows arbitrary octet strings to be placed in the "resource" and "rel" fields.&nbsp; Is that <br>really your intention?&nbsp; It seems like these should be constrained to something like the syntax of the "source" and "rel" fields in the JRD, namely, an ASCII token or URI.<br><br>2.4. The scheme and path paragraphs from 4.2. should be moved up to this section.<br><br>3. Section 4.2. I couldn't figure out what HTTP methods a client is allowed to use.&nbsp; It seems to me that it would be sensible to allow only GET, unless there is a concrete use case for something else.&nbsp; <br><br>4. Section 4.5. says "use of the "acct" URI scheme is recommended, since it explicitly identifies an account accessible via WebFinger".&nbsp; This does not seem compatible with what is in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-appsawg-acct-uri/">draft-ietf-appsawg-acct-uri</a>, "Therefore, any protocol that uses 'acct' URIs, such as the WebFinger protocol [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-appsawg-webfinger/">I-D.ietf-appsawg-webfinger</a>] or the Simple Web Discovery protocol [<a href="/doc/draft-jones-simple-web-discovery/">I-D.jones-simple-web-discovery</a>],"&nbsp; Suggest removing this text. <br><br>5. In general, the use of "acct" URIs do not seem all that useful.&nbsp; The only way they are used in the example use cases are (1) as a replacement for a "mailto" URI, and (2) as a "dummy" URI scheme for a "user@host" string lacking other context.&nbsp; In the former case, you might as well have just used the "mailto" URI.&nbsp; The latter case is kind of artificial, since the whole example is premised on the use of "acct".&nbsp;  It might help motivate these URIs if Section 4.1. actually used part of the resource URI to derive part of the WebFinger URI, e.g., using the host part of the URI as&nbsp; the host for the WebFinger URI.<br><br>6. (moved to comment)<br><br>7. With regard to Section 8.2., I agree with Stephen that there should be some mechanism specified for users to control what information is accessible about them through WebFinger.&nbsp; What's even more concerning here is that it's not even clear which servers a user should contact to control his information.&nbsp; If my address is "mailto:<a href="mailto:rlb@example.com">rlb@example.com</a>", do I just need to contact the WebFinger resources at "<a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>"?&nbsp; Or is it possible that there's some other WebFinger server out there serving information about my address, say "<a href="http://evil.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=mailto%3Arlb%40example.com">http://evil.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=mailto%3Arlb%40example.com</a>"?&nbsp; This is another area where a tighter specification would help.</div></td>

But this doesn't address my needs. I like the idea. I want the feature. But I don't want it to turn into a privacy hole. This is very easily addressed, since it's not even a problem with webfinger per se—just a problem with how someone might _use_ webfinger. The solution: add some text to the security considerations section.&nbsp;  I would suggest adding some text to section 8.3:<br><br>Automatic user agents such as mail readers and web browsers SHOULD NOT automatically query webfinger on the basis of unsolicited messages received over the network. For instance, a mail reader that has the capability to query webfinger for information about the sender of an email message, such as an avatar, jabber ID, etc., SHOULD NOT issue such a query unless the message has been validated as coming from a known source, and unless the source appears on some kind of white list available to or maintained by the mail reader. Implementors are advised that merely checking the "From:" header or the "envelope from" header of an email message is definitely not sufficient validation, because such headers are easily forged in the absence of some additional validation mechanism, such as PGP, S/MIME (for per-message validation) or DKIM [<a href="/doc/rfc6376/">RFC 6376</a>].<br><br>I don't know if this would satisfy Stephen's concerns about privacy, but it would satisfy mine—I agree with the authors that the privacy issue is only incidentally a webfinger issue.<br><br>Oh, one last thing: I agree with Pete's DISCUSS on this: although it's fairly obvious to me what the authors intend with respect to the acct URI, it's seriously underspecified, and I don't believe that it would be obvious to every potential reader of the document. I don't have a specific action for this, so I'm not adding it as a DISCUSS, but it bears thinking about. E.g., if the _only_ transform we're expecting is s/mailto:/acct:/, then that's really easy to specify; why not specify it? If we're expecting other possible transformations, do we have any idea what they might be? Jabber IDs? I think Kerberos principals were mentioned in some conversation; are they also fair game?</div></td>

Implementors are advised that merely checking the "From:" header or the "envelope from" header of an email message is definitely not sufficient validation, because such headers are easily forged in the absence of some additional validation mechanism, such as PGP, S/MIME (for per-message validation) or DKIM [<a href="/doc/rfc6376/">RFC 6376</a>].<br><br>I don't know if this would satisfy Stephen's concerns about privacy, but it would satisfy mine—I agree with the authors that the privacy issue is only incidentally a webfinger issue.<br><br>Oh, one last thing: I agree with Pete's DISCUSS on this: although it's fairly obvious to me what the authors intend with respect to the acct URI, it's seriously underspecified, and I don't believe that it would be obvious to every potential reader of the document.&nbsp;  I don't have a specific action for this, so I'm not adding it as a DISCUSS, but it bears thinking about.&nbsp;  E.g., if the _only_ transform we're expecting is s/mailto:/acct:/, then that's really easy to specify; why not specify it?&nbsp;  If we're expecting other possible transformations, do we have any idea what they might be?&nbsp;  Jabber IDs?</div></td>

These models evolved not in the abstract, but as a response to user demand.<br><br>This document addresses a need similar to that addressed by Facebook and G+ user profiles, but in a distributed fashion.&nbsp;  With a solid security model, I think it would be very beneficial.&nbsp;  So the action for this DISCUSS, if it isn't clear, is to develop a security model.&nbsp;  I realize that's a big ask, but without a security model I think this document is going to cause a lot of harm, or else not get used, neither of which is a desirable outcome.</div></td>

If I get no further support from the IESG and/or the WG that this is a serious and showstopper problem, I will simply ABSTAIN on both this and on the -acct-uri document (on which I also currently have an open DISCUSS position). But it looks like Richard and I are in some agreement on this.]<br><br>There appears to be a big giant semantic gap for the client side of this protocol. I can find nothing in the document that indicates to the client how it shall determine what sort of URI to use is the resource part of the query or what the semantics of any given URI are supposed to be. I suspect that the semantics are so underspecified that there could not possibly be interoperable implementations without lots of out-of-band information.<br><br>The first example provides a mapping from an email address (or perhaps a mailto URI; that's not clear) to an acct URI, but neither the example nor anything in the rest of the document gives any clue why you would choose to query an "acct" URI based on the contents of an email message. I think the assumption is that if there is an email address, there must be some sort of "account" associated with it, and therefore querying the host on the RHS of the "@" for that account will get some interesting information. But I don't see any reason to choose an "acct" scheme over "mailto" or "smtp" or "email" or "foobar"; as far as I can tell, the choice is semantics-free.<br><br>Reading the above alongside 3.3 makes me all the more suspicious: In 3.3 (also mentioned in 4.5), a "mailto" URI gets you configuration information for all email configuration parameters. Does an "acct" URI get you configuration information for email *and* xmpp *and* sip *and* calendaring *and* all other configuration information (since you are no longer asking for a particular protocol, but rather the general account information), or do you only get "information" about the person and not their account? (I might also insert privacy and security worries here, but see Stephen's DISCUSS regarding that.) How can the client know what sort of information it can ask for and how to get it? And for that matter, how does the server tell what information to pass back? You'd think there would be a hint about this in 4.3, but "rel" only seems to provide for the client to request those things that the client already knows about it. In particular, there appears to be no way to say, "Give me user provided information, but not config information" or "Give me config information, but not blog entries".<br><br>I find the semantics for "device" in 3.4 all-the-more mysterious. As far as I can tell, this URI scheme simply means, "Give me all of the information for the entire host."<br><br>Again, the semantics of all of these interactions seem so underspecified that I don't understand how interoperation is supposed to happen.<br><br>This also leaves me with the question about why the resource query part is a URI at all. It seems to me that the resource you are asking about is not a URI (or URN) at all; it's simply an identifier for an entity that the particular host knows about. Given that, why not pass a simple identifier? (See <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/</a> for example.) If the scheme is not providing any particular semantics about the response, I see no reason to provide the scheme. If more semantics (beyond rel) are needed, another parameter indicating the type of identifier being used seems much more appropriate than using a URI scheme.</div></td>

Apologies if these are stupid questions<br>caused by lack of clue - and in that case please just respond with<br>"this would be obvious if you had any idea what you were talking<br>about."<br><br>---<br><br>Can the WebFinger source provide that his information can be accessed<br>at different levels by different people. For example, make his blog<br>and website available to everyone, but his phone number require a<br>specific access level?<br><br>---<br><br>I don't understand how the source can certify that the information<br>being read from the server is information he supplied rather than <br>information that a malign (or error-prone) third party has placed <br>on their own WebFinger server. Can the information be signed as a<br>set such that information outside the set is marked as not <br>authenticated?<br><br>As I understand it, the value of the information supplied by the<br>WebFinger server depends on the level of trust that the reader places<br>on the server. Obviously, if my email is hosted by <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>, then<br>I might trust that the information I write (perhaps through a web<br>interface) to the <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a> server will be present in the WebFinger<br>response, but what if <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a> decides to add to the information or<br>place data there that I do not want made public? Is the claim that this<br>is simply an issue for the commercial relationship between me and <br><a href="http://example.com?">example.com?</a> How does the reader distinguish between information I have<br>supplied and information <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a> has decided to add?<br><br>Furthermore, it isn't clear to me what control there is on <a href="http://example.org">example.org</a><br>supplying WebFinger responses for an <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a> user. That is, if the<br>request is:<br>&nbsp; GET /.well-known/webfinger?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  resource=acct%3Abob%<a href="http://40example.com">40example.com</a> HTTP/1.1<br>&nbsp; Host: <a href="http://example.org">example.org</a><br><br>---<br><br>I was a bit uneasy about calling the process in the example in Section<br>3.3 "autoconfiguration". I think, in fact, it is just normal <br>configuration. But, of course, it is remote configuration. Perhaps its<br>would better be called "Configuration Retrieval".<br><br>---<br><br>I am really uneasy about the inclusion of the example in section 3.4.<br>Not only is it "totally fictitious", but I think it is widening the<br>scope of WebFinger into dynamic device-level information. That sort of<br>thing needs, IMHO, a wider discussion within the IETF.<br><br>Since the example is not a real one and is dependent on extensions to<br>a spec that might not be extended and is out of scope for the IETF,<br>perhaps we can regard the section as "marketing" in support of<br>WebFinger. Since WebFinger has clearly been accepted as an idea, would<br>it be possible to delete this section?<br><br>There would also be a small change to the Introduction as well.</div></td>

Some of those are most<br>apparent through the use-cases/examples so I've taken the<br>unusal step of DISCUSSing those since they really seem to<br>convey the real intent of this protocol. To an extent, some<br>of the suggested changes there do represent personal<br>preferences of mine but I believe that the DISCUSSion is<br>still worth having between the authors and IESG and perhaps<br>the WG. <br><br>(1) 3.1, having the MUA automatically do the webfinger thing<br>is a privacy disaster and would cause MUAs to visit sources<br>of spam continually and to expose the email addresses of<br>their correspondents. Other references to having a UA<br>automatically do webfinger also need to be deleted kind of<br>behaviour needs to be the subject of a "MUST NOT" statement<br>IMO. In fact, it already is, since 8.2 says: "WebFinger MUST<br>NOT be used to provide any personal data to any party unless<br>explicitly authorized by the person whose information is<br>being shared." Having a MUA automatically send out a WF<br>request where the query target is the mail sender/from<br>contradicts this requirement. The 3.1 example also fits the<br>anti-pattern given in 8.3. Suggested fix, easy: say that a<br>MUA MUST NOT do the automatic thing, as per 8.2, which would<br>be a fine forward reference.<br><br>(2) 3.3, this example is odd - why should Sue expose her<br>username in this interaction - there's no occurrence of<br>anything clearly user-dependent in the response except what<br>was given in the request. Why should we expose user<br>information unnecessarily in this manner? I think the fix<br>here is for user Sue to send a request for "<a href="mailto:anon@example.com">anon@example.com</a>"<br>and for the text to specifically say that making use of the<br>real username isn't a good plan and making use of an invented<br>non-existent string for username in this case is a fine plan<br>and perhaps even specifying such a "nonexistent" username<br>value that can be supported by and understood by all clients<br>and servers and saying when it'd be sensible to use that.<br><br>(3) 3.4, making devices discoverable like this, esp if device<br>type and firmware revisions were to be exposed represents a<br>significant increase in an existing risk.&nbsp; (We had a recent<br>discussion related to vCard for a similar use case.) This<br>section seems to be too speculative to be honest, so I'd<br>suggest just deleting it.

Some of those are most<br>apparent through the use-cases/examples so I've taken the<br>unusal step of DISCUSSing those since they really seem to<br>convey the real intent of this protocol. To an extent, some<br>of the suggested changes there do represent personal<br>preferences of mine but I believe that the DISCUSSion is<br>still worth having between the authors and IESG and perhaps<br>the WG. <br><br>(1) 3.1, having the MUA automatically do the webfinger thing<br>is a privacy disaster and would cause MUAs to visit sources<br>of spam continually and to expose the email addresses of<br>their correspondents. Other references to having a UA<br>automatically do webfinger also need to be deleted kind of<br>behaviour needs to be the subject of a "MUST NOT" statement<br>IMO. In fact, it already is, since 8.2 says: "WebFinger MUST<br>NOT be used to provide any personal data to any party unless<br>explicitly authorized by the person whose information is<br>being shared." Having a MUA automatically send out a WF<br>request where the query target is the mail sender/from<br>contradicts this requirement. The 3.1 example also fits the<br>anti-pattern given in 8.3. Suggested fix, easy: say that a<br>MUA MUST NOT do the automatic thing, as per 8.2, which would<br>be a fine forward reference.<br><br>(2) 3.3, this example is odd - why should Sue expose her<br>username in this interaction - there's no occurrence of<br>anything clearly user-dependent in the response except what<br>was given in the request. Why should we expose user<br>information unnecessarily in this manner? I think the fix<br>here is for user Sue to send a request for "<a href="mailto:anon@example.com">anon@example.com</a>"<br>and for the text to specifically say that making use of the<br>real username isn't a good plan and making use of an invented<br>non-existent string for username in this case is a fine plan<br>and perhaps even specifying such a "nonexistent" username<br>value that can be supported by and understood by all clients<br>and servers and saying when it'd be sensible to use that.<br><br>(3) 3.4, making devices discoverable like this, esp if device<br>type and firmware revisions were to be exposed represents a<br>significant increase in an existing risk.&nbsp; (We had a recent<br>discussion related to vCard for a similar use case.) This<br>section seems to be too speculative to be honest, so I'd<br>suggest just deleting it. If not, maybe add text like that<br>added in the vCard case. <br><br>(4) 4.2, can you explain the security consdiderations<br>associated with re-directing a client from<br><a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a> to <a href="https://example.net?">https://example.net?</a> Why don't you<br>need to do that explicitly in the document?

Ignore all "rel" values that contain link relation types that<br>are not defined for the specified resource.<br>2. If there are other "rel" values left, filter on them as though<br>they were the only ones present.<br>3. If there are *no* other "rel" values left, do *not* return an<br>unfiltered JRD.&nbsp; Instead, either:<br>3a. ...return a JRD with an empty "links" array ("links" : [ ]), or<br>3b. ...return a JRD with no "links" array present at all.<br><br>Is there a reason to allow both 3a and 3b, rather than specifying<br>one or the other?<br><br>In any case, please re-word this paragraph so it says clearly<br>what you want it to say.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Other minor comments:<br><br>In the last paragraph of Section 3.2, you have "OPTIONAL".&nbsp; The<br>2119 keyword is out of place in this non-normative example. <br>Besides: it's not optional; it's a "SHOULD support".&nbsp; So, really,<br>change "is OPTIONAL" to "is not guaranteed".<br><br>In the first paragraph of Section 4, to be consistent with how<br>you render things later, you should probably make these changes<br>(and then make sure your use of this is consistent throughout the<br>document):<br><br>&nbsp;  using the HTTPS scheme =&gt; using the "https" scheme<br><br>&nbsp;  other URI scheme (such as HTTP) ==&gt; other URI scheme (such as "http")<br><br>In Section 4:<br>&nbsp;  GET requests to a WebFinger resource convey the URI to perform the<br>&nbsp;  query upon in the URI's query string; see Section 4.1 for details.<br><br>First, I find this to be an awkward, with two different URIs not<br>clearly differentiated.&nbsp; Second, Section 4.1 doesn't actually<br>give details of the "URI to perform the query upon".&nbsp; Maybe<br>this?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  A WebFinger resource is always given a query target, which is<br>&nbsp;  another URI that identifies the entity whose information is<br>&nbsp;  sought.&nbsp; GET requests to a WebFinger resource convey the query<br>&nbsp;  target in the "resource" parameter in the WebFinger URI's query<br>&nbsp;  string; see Section 4.1 for details.<br>END<br><br>In Section 4.1:<br>&nbsp;  First, each parameter value is percent-encoded, as<br>&nbsp;  per Section 2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a>, so that it conforms to the query<br>&nbsp;  production in Section 3.4 of that specification, and additionally any<br>&nbsp;  instances of the "=" and "&amp;" characters are also percent-encoded.<br><br>I think this would be a bit clearer this way:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  First, each parameter value is percent-encoded, as<br>&nbsp;  per Section 2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a>.&nbsp; The encoding is done to conform to<br>&nbsp;  the query production in Section 3.4 of that specification, with the <br>&nbsp;  addition that any instances of the "=" and "&amp;" characters within the<br>&nbsp;  parameter value are also percent-encoded.<br>END<br><br>I think that will avoid anyone's trying to encode the "=" in<br>"resource=", and the like.<br><br>&nbsp;  The order in which the client places each<br>&nbsp;  attribute-and-value pair within the query component is unspecified.<br><br>Is that really trying to say that the order has to be treated as<br>insignificant when the query component is interpreted?&nbsp; If so, it<br>should say it that way:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The order in which the client places each<br>&nbsp;  attribute-and-value pair within the query component does not matter<br>&nbsp;  in the interpretation of the query component.<br>END<br><br>In Section 4.2:<br>&nbsp;  The client MAY include the "Accept"<br>&nbsp;  header to indicate a desired representation, though no other<br>&nbsp;  representation than JRD is defined in this specification.<br><br>I think I might prefer this:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The client MAY include the "Accept"<br>&nbsp;  header to indicate a desired representation; representations<br>&nbsp;  other than JRD might be defined in future specifications.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  WebFinger resource MUST silently ignore any requested<br>&nbsp;  representations that it does not understand and support.<br>END<br><br>&nbsp;  A WebFinger resource MAY redirect the client, but MUST only redirect<br>&nbsp;  the client to an HTTPS URI.<br><br>I don't think this will actually be misinterpreted, but just to<br>be clear about the MAY/MUST thing:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  A WebFinger resource MAY redirect the client; if it does, the<br>&nbsp;  redirection MUST only be to an "https" URI.<br>END<br><br>In Section 4.3:<br>&nbsp;  When the "rel" parameter is used, only the link relations<br>&nbsp;  that match the link relations provided via the "rel" parameter are<br>&nbsp;  included in the array of links returned in the JRD.<br><br>Not when it's *used* -- it can be used, but the resource might<br>not support it, right?&nbsp; So:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  When the "rel" parameter is used and accepted, only the link<br>&nbsp;  relations that match the link relations provided via the "rel"<br>&nbsp;  parameter are included in the array of links returned in the JRD.<br>END<br><br>&nbsp;  The "rel" parameter MAY be transmitted to the WebFinger resource<br>&nbsp;  multiple times in order to request multiple types of link relations.<br><br>Does this really mean this?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  The "rel" parameter MAY be included in the query component of the<br>&nbsp;  WebFinger URI multiple times in order to request multiple types of<br>&nbsp;  link relations.<br>END<br><br>Actually, I think "in the query component of the WebFinger URI"<br>can be removed, to just say, "MAY be included multiple times".<br><br>In Section 4.4, you've hit a pedantic pet peeve of mine that's a<br>lost cause that I still fight:<br><br>&nbsp;  a JSON object that is comprised of the following<br><br>Correctly, the whole "comprises" the parts (or "is composed of",<br>but not "is comprised of").<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  a JSON object that comprises the following<br>END<br><br>And similarly in the following paragraph and in Sections 4.4.3,<br>4.4.4.4, and 4.4.4.5.<br><br>In Section 4.5:<br>&nbsp;  WebFinger requests can include a "resource" parameter (see Section<br>&nbsp;  4.1) specifying the URI of an account, device, or other entity.<br><br>Not "can include"; they do include it: Section 4.2 says that the<br>'query component MUST include the "resource" parameter exactly<br>once'.<br><br>&nbsp;  To perform a WebFinger lookup on an account specific to the host<br>&nbsp;  being queried, use of the "acct" URI scheme is RECOMMENDED, since it<br>&nbsp;  explicitly identifies an account accessible via WebFinger.<br><br>I'm racking my brain, trying to decide whether this is an<br>appropriate 2119 "RECOMMENDED", which means "SHOULD", which means<br>that there's an interoperability reason why you must do this<br>unless you fully understand the consequences of not doing it.<br><br>If what you're saying is that "acct" is always guaranteed to<br>work, while others, such as "mailto" are crap shoots, then I<br>think "RECOMMENDED" is OK.&nbsp; But if they all might or might not<br>work, and we're just saying that "acct" was made for this and<br>we're encouraging its use and it's the best of the bunch, then<br>that's not a 2119 "RECOMMENDED".<br><br>So can you clarify this for me (in email; don't change the text yet)?<br><br>In Section 6:<br>&nbsp;  As with all web resources, access to the WebFinger resource MAY<br>&nbsp;  require authentication.&nbsp; Further, failure to provide required<br>&nbsp;  credentials MAY result in the server forbidding access or providing a<br>&nbsp;  different response than had the client authenticated with the server.<br><br>Neither of these "MAY"s is an appropriate 2119 key word.&nbsp; "MAY"<br>means "this is a completely optional choice".&nbsp; The WebFinger<br>resource will either require authentication or it won't, but<br>that's not a MAY sort of choice for anyone.&nbsp; Make both of them<br>"may", or perhaps "might" or "could".<br><br>Just as a contrast, the MAY in the second paragraph is fine,<br>because it really is describing a choice that the resource can<br>make, at its option.<br><br>In the third paragraph, it's less clear.&nbsp; Given the example you<br>use, I'd remove the "MAY".&nbsp; But I'm not going to beat you with<br>truncheons about that one.<br><br>In Section 8:<br>On the two paragraphs about private/personal information, I<br>suggest explicitly passing that by Alissa Cooper for review and<br>comment, if you haven't already.<br><br>Section 9.1:<br>It would be good to explicitly request review on the<br> mailing list now.&nbsp; That could<br>save time for the formality later.<br><br>---------------------------------------------</div></td>

Review and Consensus<br><br>The "WebFinger" draft has been discussed extensively within the<br>APPSAwg during the last year, it become a wg item in August 2012.<br>Actually at some point the mail traffic generated by the<br>discussion was so high that it was agreed to move the discussion to a<br>dedicated mailing list<br>(<a href="mailto:webfinger@ietf.org">webfinger@ietf.org</a>).<br><br>The only significant point difficult to agree on has been about<br>"whether WebFinger MUST support HTTPS only or instead it should be<br>allowed for WebFinger<br>fallback from HTTPS to HTTP". That was resolved with a<br>consensus call that generated a strong rough consensus for HTTPS only.<br><br>The draft has been also extensively reviewed during the APPSAwg<br>Last Call. A lot of editorial issues, text clarifications have been<br>raised; all of them are now<br>addressed in the current version of the draft. During the wglc<br>process it has been also agreed to define a new media type for WebFinger.<br><br>There are several open source WebFinger implementations already<br>updated to the last version of the draft, a not exhaustive list of them<br>can be found here:<br><a href="http://www.packetizer.com/webfinger/software.html">http://www.packetizer.com/webfinger/software.html</a><br><br><br>3.
