The OSPFv3 Router Information LSA uses 'Link State ID (Instance ID)' so please correct the last sentence of the second <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; paragraph to replace 'LSA ID' with 'Link State ID (Instance ID)'.<br><br>- Section 7.1 SRv6 Locator TLV:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - The text 'Locator continued..' in Figure 5 might be confusing as perhaps it is just me but when I initially read it, I thought that multiple Locators could be carried in the TLV. This is not the case of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; course. It would be easier on the eyes if the entire 'Locator' field of Figure 5 were just a single block of 128-bits. Same comment for Figures 6, 7, and 8.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - The 'Locator Length' field indicates the number of Locator bits used in the 'Locator' field. This will almost certainly be less than 128-bits. Should the unused bits in the 'Locator' field be set to 0? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; please specify as currently, the text is silent.</div></td>

This sentence does not make much sense. Suggest change to 'An SR instantiation on the IPv6 dataplane is <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  referred to as SRv6' or something along those lines.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  - Fourth paragraph reads 'This document specifies OSPFv3 extensions to support SRv6 as defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC8986</a>].' This statement is not accurate as <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> does not define SRv6 but rather it defines SRv6 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  network programming. Note further that the document provides extensions to support SRH, network programming and the O-bit so perhaps this sentence should read 'This document specifies OSPFv3 extensions to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  support SRv6 capabilities as defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC8986</a>][<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] and [<a href="/doc/rfc9259/">RFC9259</a>]'.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  - The text refers to 'algorithm-specific SIDs' - what are these exactly? there is no definition for this term, and I have not seen it in any other SRv6-related document.

Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp; This document had broader consensus than most OSPFv3 documents with actual<br>&nbsp; implementors from Huawei, Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and Arrcus reviewing the<br>&nbsp; draft or contributing to the updates during the last call period. As always,<br>&nbsp; it would be better if there were earliar reviews and discussions. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; There was no real controversy although there was discussion as to whether it<br>&nbsp; was a good idea to have a separate Link State Advertisements (LSAs) for the<br>&nbsp; SRv6 Locators as opposed to using the existing LSAs. Unlike IS-IS, one of<br>&nbsp; the advantages of OSPFv3 is that disjoint information can be advertised in<br>&nbsp; separate LSAs.<br><br>&nbsp; Review by OSPFv3 implementors revealed that the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions needed<br>&nbsp; to be advertised in the SRV6 Locator TLV. This specification adds the AC-Bit<br>&nbsp; (AnyCast Bit) which is applicable to all usages of the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a Huawei implemenation underway but it has not been released yet and<br>&nbsp;  there is no report.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The SPRING WG has been notified.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Routing Directorate Review is in progress. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp;  Not Applicable. <br><br>8.

Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable.<br><br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed Standard. This is appropriate given that the document specifies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the protocol encodings required for interoperable SRv6 operation. <br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. Only four authors. Dean Cheng was removed as an author due to his<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retirement and disengagement from the IETF. <br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No nits. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. All references are properly categorized. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable. <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; None. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No changes to other documents. <br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA review has been done at each phase and the codepoints have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been allocated through the early allocation process.

Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp; This document had broader consensus than most OSPFv3 documents with actual<br>&nbsp; implementors from Huawei, Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and Arrcus reviewing the<br>&nbsp; draft or contributing to the updates during the last call period. As always,<br>&nbsp; it would be better if there were earliar reviews and discussions. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; There was no real controversy although there was discussion as to whether it<br>&nbsp; was a good idea to have a separate Link State Advertisements (LSAs) for the<br>&nbsp; SRv6 Locators as opposed to using the existing LSAs. Unlike IS-IS, one of<br>&nbsp; the advantages of OSPFv3 is that disjoint information can be advertised in<br>&nbsp; separate LSAs.<br><br>&nbsp; Review by OSPFv3 implementors revealed that the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions needed<br>&nbsp; to be advertised in the SRV6 Locator TLV. This specification adds the AC-Bit<br>&nbsp; (AnyCast Bit) which is applicable to all usages of the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a Huawei implemenation underway but it has not been released yet and<br>&nbsp;  there is no report.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The SPRING WG has been notified.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Routing Directorate Review is in progress. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp;  Not Applicable. <br><br>8.

Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable.<br><br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed Standard. This is appropriate given that the document specifies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the protocol encodings required for interoperable SRv6 operation. <br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. Only four authors. Dean Cheng was removed as an author due to his<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retirement and disengagement from the IETF. <br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No nits. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. All references are properly categorized. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable. <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; None. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No changes to other documents. <br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA review has been done at each phase and the codepoints have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been allocated through the early allocation process. An additional<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; request has been made to add the AC-Bit to the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; registry. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations.

Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp; This document had broader consensus than most OSPFv3 documents with actual<br>&nbsp; implementors from Huawei, Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and Arrcus reviewing the<br>&nbsp; draft or contributing to the updates during the last call period. As always,<br>&nbsp; it would be better if there were earliar reviews and discussions. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; There was no real controversy although there was discussion as to whether it<br>&nbsp; was a good idea to have a separate Link State Advertisements (LSAs) for the<br>&nbsp; SRv6 Locators as opposed to using the existing LSAs. Unlike IS-IS, one of<br>&nbsp; the advantages of OSPFv3 is that disjoint information can be advertised in<br>&nbsp; separate LSAs.<br><br>&nbsp; Review by OSPFv3 implementors revealed that the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions needed<br>&nbsp; to be advertised in the SRV6 Locator TLV.

(It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a Huawei implemenation underway but it has not been released yet and<br>&nbsp;  there is no report.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The SPRING WG has been notified.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Routing Directorate Review is in progress. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp;  Not Applicable. <br><br>8.

Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable.<br><br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed Standard. This is appropriate given that the document specifies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the protocol encodings required for interoperable SRv6 operation. <br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. Only four authors. Dean Cheng was removed as an author due to his<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retirement and disengagement from the IETF. <br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No nits. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. All references are properly categorized. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable. <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; None. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No changes to other documents. <br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA review has been done at each phase and the codepoints have<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been allocated through the early allocation process. An additional<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; request has been made to add the AC-Bit to the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; registry. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Assignments to the two new registries are made through IETF Review or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IESG Approval [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>].<br></div></td>

Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp; This document had broader consensus than most OSPFv3 documents with actual<br>&nbsp; implementors from Huawei, Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and Arrcus reviewing the<br>&nbsp; draft or contributing to the updates during the last call period. As always,<br>&nbsp; it would be better if there were earliar reviews and discussions. <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; There was no real controversy although there was discussion as to whether it<br>&nbsp; was a good idea to have a separate Link State Advertisements (LSAs) for the<br>&nbsp; SRv6 Locators as opposed to using the existing LSAs. Unlike IS-IS, one of<br>&nbsp; the advantages of OSPFv3 is that disjoint information can be advertised in<br>&nbsp; separate LSAs. <br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a Huawei implemenation underway but it has not been released yet and<br>&nbsp;  there is no report.<br><br>## Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other<br>&nbsp;  IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit<br>&nbsp;  from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which<br>&nbsp;  reviews took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The SPRING WG has been notified.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Routing Directorate Review is in progress. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp;  Not Applicable. <br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  Not Appliable. <br><br>## Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not Applicable.<br><br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed Standard. This is appropriate given that the document specifies<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the protocol encodings required for interoperable SRv6 operation. <br><br>12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8]? To<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to publicly-available messages when applicable.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; is greater than five, please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. Only four authors. Dean Cheng was removed as an author due to his<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; retirement and disengagement from the IETF. <br><br>14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No nits. <br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. All references are properly categorized. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone.
