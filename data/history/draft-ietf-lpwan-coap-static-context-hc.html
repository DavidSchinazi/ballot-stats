 SCHC will send the second element of the URI-Path with the length<br>&nbsp;  (i.e., 0x2 X 6) followed by the query option (i.e., 0x05 "eth0").<br><br>I don't think I understand where the 0x05 comes from -- aren't there<br>only four non-NUL characters in "eth0"?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>(nit) I think the "The [<a href="/doc/rfc7967/">RFC7967</a>] defines a No-Response option limiting<br>the responses made by a server to a request" was better than the current<br>"The [<a href="/doc/rfc7967/">RFC7967</a>] defines a No-Response".<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that a client located in an Application Server sending a request<br>&nbsp;  to a server located in the Device may not be compressed through this<br>&nbsp;  Rule since the MID will not start with 7 bits equal to 0.&nbsp; A CoAP<br><br>nit(?): I am not 100% sure I understand the specifics here, but I think<br>the concern is just that the CoAP client in the Application Server might<br>be using the simple "single Message ID" strategy for all its outbound<br>requests, and thus might use more than 9 bits of message-ID space and<br>achieve the "not start with 7 bits equal to 0" condition.&nbsp; As far as I<br>can tell, though, there is no fundamental reason why such requests would<br>*always* have a MID that does not start with 7 bits equal to zero, so I<br>would suggest s/will not/might not/.<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>I recognize the width constraints of the table, but in Figure 13 the<br>"mapp-sent" CDA is not a term that seems to be used anywhere else in the<br>document.&nbsp; I believe that it is okay to format this with a line break,<br>so that "mapping-" is on the first line and "sent" on the second.<br><br>&nbsp;  must include it without compression.&nbsp; The use of integrity translates<br>&nbsp;  into an overhead in total message length, limiting the amount of<br>&nbsp;  compression that can be achieved and plays into the cost of adding<br>&nbsp;  security to the exchange.<br><br>nit: s/integrity/integrity protection/<br><br>&nbsp;  The piv field lends itself to having some bits masked off with "MSB"<br>&nbsp;  MO and "LSB" CDA.&nbsp; This SCHC description could be useful in<br>&nbsp;  applications where the message frequency is low such as LPWAN<br>&nbsp;  technologies.&nbsp; Note that compressing the sequence numbers may reduce<br>&nbsp;  the maximum number of sequence numbers used in an exchange.&nbsp; Once the<br>&nbsp;  sequence number exceeds the maximum value, the OSCORE keys need to be<br>&nbsp;  re-established.<br><br>nit: s/maximum number of sequence numbers used in an exchange/maximum<br>number of sequence numbers that can be used in an exchange/<br><br>Section 9<br><br>The change to say that "when using another layer two, integrity<br>protection is mandatory" is enough to address my discuss point, but the<br>section as a whole is still fairly inscrutable in general.&nbsp; If it's<br>useful, here's my take on how it could be written -- feel free to ignore<br>or take whichever parts you do/don't want.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>The use of SCHC header compression for CoAP header fields only affects<br>the representation of the header information.&nbsp; SCHC header compression<br>itself does not increase or decrease the overall level of security of<br>the communication.&nbsp; When the connection does not use a security protocol<br>(such as OSCORE, DTLS, etc.), it is necessary to use a layer-two<br>security mechanism to protect the SCHC messages.<br><br>If LPWAN is the layer-two technology, the SCHC security considerations<br>of [<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>] continue to apply.&nbsp; When using another layer-two protocol,<br>use of a cryptographic integrity-protection mechanisms to protect the<br>SCHC headers is REQUIRED.&nbsp; Such cryptographic integrity protection is<br>necessary in order to continue to provide the properties that [<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>]<br>relies upon.<br><br>When SCHC is used with OSCORE, the security considerations of [<a href="/doc/rfc8613/">RFC8613</a>]<br>continue to apply.<br><br>When SCHC is used with the OSCORE outer headers, the Initialization<br>Vector (IV) size in the Compression Residue must be carefully selected.<br>There is a tradeoff between compression efficiency (with a longer "MSB"<br>MO prefix) and the frequency at which the Device must renew its key<br>material (in order to prevent the IV from expanding to an uncompressable<br>value).&nbsp; The key renewal operation itself requires several message<br>exchanges and requires energy-intensive computation, but the optimal<br>tradeoff will depend on the specifics of the device and expected usage<br>patterns.<br><br>If an attacker can introduce a corrupted SCHC-compressed packet onto a<br>link, DoS attacks are possible by causing excessive resource consumption<br>at the decompressor.&nbsp; However, an attacker able to inject packets at the<br>link layer is also capable of other, potentially more damaging, attacks.<br><br>SCHC compression emits variable-length Compression Residues for some<br>CoAP fields.&nbsp; In the compressed header representation, the length field<br>that is sent is not the length of the original header field but rather<br>the length of the Compression Residue that is being transmitted.&nbsp; If a<br>corrupted packet arrives at the decompressor with a longer or shorter<br>length than the original compressed representation possessed, the SCHC<br>decompression procedures will detect an error and drop the packet.<br><br>SCHC header compression rules MUST remain tightly coupled between<br>compressor and decompressor.&nbsp; If the compression rules get out of sync,<br>a Compression Residue might be decompressed differently at the receiver<br>than the initial message submitted to compression procedures.<br>Accordingly, any time the context Rules are updated on an OSCORE<br>endpoint, that endpoint MUST trigger OSCORE key re-establishment.<br>Similar procedures may be appropriate to signal Rule udpates when other<br>message-protection mechanisms are in use.</div></td>

 efficiency reduction.&nbsp; However, an intruder having the ability to add<br><br>Usually I think of "compression efficiency" as relating to the ratio of<br>sizes between compressed and uncompressed form.&nbsp; What seems to be<br>described here is instead the resource efficiency of the entity<br>performing the decompression function, so I'd suggest using a different<br>phrasing, such as "excessive resource consumption at the decompressor".<br><br>&nbsp;  SCHC compression returns variable-length Residues for some CoAP<br>&nbsp;  fields.&nbsp; In the compressed header, the length sent is not the<br>&nbsp;  original header field length but the length of the Residue.&nbsp; So if a<br>&nbsp;  corrupted packet comes to the decompressor with a longer or shorter<br>&nbsp;  length than the one in the original header, SCHC decompression will<br>&nbsp;  detect an error and drops the packet.<br><br>I don't think I understand the mechanism being described here.&nbsp; It<br>sounds as if there is supposed to be some error-checking ability between<br>the recovered (uncompressed) text and the original header, but I don't<br>see such a mechanism.&nbsp; The length in the compressed packet is used to<br>interpret the residue and produce the recovered (uncompressed) value,<br>but the original packet is not available for comparison at that time.<br>If the length in the compressed packet is modified, then the<br>decompressor will get desychronized from the bit stream and start trying<br>to parse "random" data as the rest of the packet; that would be expected<br>to usually produce an error eventually, but I'm not convinced that this<br>is the mechanism referred to by "detect an error and drops [sic] the<br>packet".<br><br>The secdir review of the -15 made some good points and suggestions,<br>including pointing out in the security considerations that the typical<br>compression attacks we worry about aren't an issue here (and why).</div></td>

I cannot parse this sentence at all: "CoAP is an End-to-End protocol at the application level, so CoAP<br>&nbsp;  compression requires to install common Rules between two hosts and IP<br>&nbsp;  Routing may be needed to allow End-to-End communication."<br><br>What are you trying to say here?<br><br>Sec 2.

IIUC SCHC compresses one or two layers in the stack, rather than being a layer below.<br><br>- Finally, the explanation of dashed boxes vs dotted boxes is at the very end of the section. Please move it to before the first figure.<br><br>Sec 3. Expand "TV" on first use.<br><br>Sec 4.5. "&nbsp;  Token Value MUST NOT be sent as a variable length residue to avoid<br>&nbsp;  ambiguity with Token Length.&nbsp; Therefore, Token Length value MUST be<br>&nbsp;  used to define the size of the Compression Residue."<br><br>After looking through the example, I think this means that because the Token Length is being repurposed, it is not available to define variable token lengths. Maybe switch the order of the sentences. It seems like the first flows from the second. In addition, for Token Value not to be sent as variable length, that imposes constraints on the rule set, right? It would be good to clarify exactly what a rule set must do to create this outcome.<br><br>Sec.5. s/these assmetry/this asymmetry</div></td>

 CoAP [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">rfc7252</a>] is designed to easily interop with HTTP (Hypertext<br><br>What does "designed to easily interop with" mean?&nbsp; CoAP and HTTP don't<br>interoperate directly, given that they are different protocols...<br><br>&nbsp;  done.&nbsp; The context is known by both ends before transmission.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  way the context is configured, provisioned or exchanged is out of the<br>&nbsp;  scope of this document.<br><br>(editorial) I'd suggest rephrasing to something more like "The SCHC<br>compression scheme assumes as a prerequisite that the static context is<br>known to both endpoints before transmission."<br><br>&nbsp;  CoAP is an End-to-End protocol at the application level, so CoAP<br>&nbsp;  compression requires to install common Rules between two hosts and IP<br>&nbsp;  Routing may be needed to allow End-to-End communication.&nbsp; Therefore,<br>&nbsp;  SCHC compression may apply at two different levels, one to compress<br>&nbsp;  IP and UDP as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">rfc8724</a>] in the LPWAN network and another<br>&nbsp;  at the application level.&nbsp; These two compressions may be independent.<br><br>I think you want to reframe this in terms of the potential for there to<br>be multiple IP (UDP seems perhaps less likely?) entities processing the<br>packet between CoAP entities that process the packet, and note that the<br>IP compression may be removed by an intermediary in situations where<br>configured to do so.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Compression Rules can be set up by two independent entities and<br>&nbsp;  are out of the scope of this document.&nbsp; In both cases, SCHC mechanism<br>&nbsp;  remains the same.<br><br>(nit) I don't think "remains the same" is the best wording here; there<br>are clearly going to be differences of some form between compression at<br>the UDP layer and compression at the CoAP layer, even though the overall<br>structure/procedures for compressing/decompressing at those layers are<br>analogous to each other.<br><br>&nbsp;  A Matching Operator (MO) is associated to each header field<br>&nbsp;  description.&nbsp; The Rule is selected if all the MOs fit the TVs for all<br>&nbsp;  fields of the incoming header.<br><br>I strongly suggest reiterating that the presence of a header field that<br>does not have a corresponding MO in the Rule means that the Rule does<br>not apply to that packet.<br><br>&nbsp;  After applying the compression there may be some bits to be sent,<br>&nbsp;  these values are called Compression Residues.<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>I think that these examples would benefit from a fair bit more<br>description/discussion text.&nbsp; For example, if SCHC in Figure 1 is<br>supposed to be compressing everything from IPv6 to CoAP, why is SCHC<br>beween LPWAN and IPv6 (vs above IPv6), and why does the full stack still<br>appear at the 'device'?&nbsp; If the Sender and Receiver are to be the device<br>and App, then why is SCHC not apparent at the Receiver (app)?&nbsp; I can't<br>find a consistent way to interpret the text and the figure.<br>(Figures 2 and 3 have both dotted lines and dashed lines.&nbsp; Why are they<br>different?&nbsp; Etc.)<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The CoAP protocol is asymmetric, the headers are different for a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request or a response.&nbsp; For example, the URI-path option is<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Headers in IPv6 and UDP have a fixed size.&nbsp; The size is not sent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as part of the Compression Residue, but is defined in the Rule.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some CoAP header fields have variable lengths, so the length is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; also specified in the Field Description.&nbsp; For example, the Token<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC 8724</a> uses "Field Descriptor", not "Field Description".<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  the description of the Option by using in the Field ID the Option<br>&nbsp;  Number built from D-T; in TV, the Option Value; and the Option Length<br>&nbsp;  uses section 7.4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>.&nbsp; When the Option Length has a wellknown<br><br>(It looks like the subsections of 7.4 are also important, though we<br>probably don't need to literally say "section 7.4 and subsections".)<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>I'm still confused why Max-Age, Uri-Host, and Uri-Port are in the same<br>section.&nbsp; We talk about "the duration", but that seems to only apply to<br>Max-Age.<br><br>&nbsp;  Otherwise these options can be sent as a Compression Residue (fixed<br>&nbsp;  or variable length).<br><br>I'm not sure that there's going to be a practical scenario where a<br>fixed-length residue is workable for anay of these three CoAP Options.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>As far as I can tell, Proxy-URI and Proxy-Scheme are indeed<br>unidirectional (only sent in requests).&nbsp; It would perhaps be appropriate<br>to codify this restirction in the compression rules, though I can<br>understand if the general desire is to not add an additional layer of<br>restrictions beyond the core CoAP specificiation.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Since an RST message may be sent to inform a server that the client<br>&nbsp;  does not require Observe response, a Rule MUST allow the transmission<br>&nbsp;  of this message.<br><br>Is this saying that if you have a rule that allows sending Observe, you<br>MUST also have a rule allowing RST?&nbsp;

 The OSCORE Option shows superimposed these four fields using the<br>&nbsp;  format Figure 6, the CoAP OSCORE_kidctxt field includes the size bits<br>&nbsp;  s.<br><br>The rewording went awry here.&nbsp;

 SCHC compression returns variable-length Residues for some CoAP<br>&nbsp;  fields.&nbsp; In the compressed header, the length sent is not the<br>&nbsp;  original header field length but the length of the Residue.&nbsp; So if a<br>&nbsp;  corrupted packet comes to the decompressor with a longer or shorter<br>&nbsp;  length than the one in the original header, SCHC decompression will<br>&nbsp;  detect an error and drops the packet.<br><br>I don't think I understand the mechanism being described here.&nbsp; It<br>sounds as if there is supposed to be some error-checking ability between<br>the recovered (uncompressed) text and the original header, but I don't<br>see such a mechanism.&nbsp; The length in the compressed packet is used to<br>interpret the residue and produce the recovered (uncompressed) value,<br>but the original packet is not available for comparison at that time.<br>If the length in the compressed packet is modified, then the<br>decompressor will get desychronized from the bit stream and start trying<br>to parse "random" data as the rest of the packet; that would be expected<br>to usually produce an error eventually, but I'm not convinced that this<br>is the mechanism referred to by "detect an error and drops [sic] the<br>packet".<br><br>The secdir review of the -15 made some good points and suggestions,<br>including pointing out in the security considerations that the typical<br>compression attacks we worry about aren't an issue here (and why).</div></td>

Namely, the assumption about context establishment. In normal SCHC the contexts are established between the Device and the NGW. In these end-to-end encrypted case the context establishing party for the COAP compression is the APP and the APP layer in the device. This difference appear completely ignored in this document. I think this is a significant difference as having the device and NGW run a protocol for establishing context over the L2 or L3 with the local context knowledge is fairly straightforward. However, in this case when the COAP peer on the internet side of the NGW this determination and configuration is a different matter. <br><br>From my perspective some more discussion of the fact that this is a different context and that it have different challenges in establishing the context should be made clear in the document.</div></td>

These choices are expected to be generally<br>useful, but since the SCHC rules must be preagreed by all entities in<br>advance, there's not really anything to prevent a deployment from using<br>a modified version of these procedures, in terms of lost<br>interoperability.&nbsp; In addition, the shepherd writeup mentions that there<br>may be some desire to do a refresh in the future, after more<br>implementation experience is gained.&nbsp; So I don't have a great sense as<br>to which parts of this document are better as Proposed Standard vs.<br>Informational.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This draft defines the way SCHC (Static Context Header Compression)<br>&nbsp;  header compression can be applied to the CoAP protocol.&nbsp; SCHC is a<br>&nbsp;  header compression mechanism adapted for constrained devices.&nbsp; SCHC<br><br>Is it also in some sense a key requirement that these constrained<br>devices produce a fairly consistent or deterministic class of output?<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  SCHC compresses and decompresses headers based on shared contexts<br>&nbsp;  between devices.&nbsp; Each context consists of multiple Rules.&nbsp; Each rule<br>&nbsp;  can match header fields and specific values or ranges of values.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  a rule matches, the matched header fields are substituted by the rule<br>&nbsp;  ID and optionally some residual bits.&nbsp; Thus, different Rules may<br><br>Do I remember corectly that an SCHC rule matching implies that the<br>entire header structure matches (i.e., there are no fields in the header<br>not listed in the rule)?&nbsp; If so, perhaps a slight rephrasing to "If a<br>packet header fully matches a rule" would be helpful.<br><br>&nbsp;  Compression mainly results in one of 4 actions: * send the field<br>&nbsp;  value, * send nothing, * send some least significant bits of the<br>&nbsp;  field or * send an index.&nbsp; After applying the compression there may<br>&nbsp;  be some bits to be sent, these values are called Compression<br>&nbsp;  Residues.<br><br>[It looks like this is generated from Markdown and needs additional<br>blank lines between bullet points]<br><br>&nbsp;  SCHC is a general concept mechanism that can be applied to different<br><br>nit: "concept" is a noun, not an adjective, so this doesn't parse<br>properly.<br><br>&nbsp;  protocols, the exact Rules to be used depend on the protocol and the<br>&nbsp;  application, and CoAP differs from UDP and IPv6, see Section 3.<br><br>nit: comma splice ("the exact rules [...]" is a complete sentence).<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  In the third example, OSCORE [<a href="/doc/rfc8613/">rfc8613</a>] is used.&nbsp; In this case, two<br>&nbsp;  rulesets are used to compress the CoAP message.&nbsp; A first ruleset<br>&nbsp;  focused on the inner header and is applied end to end by both ends.<br>&nbsp;  A second ruleset compresses the outer header and the layers below and<br>&nbsp;  is done between the Sender and the Receiver.<br><br>Is it worth having a parllel style and mentioning that the outer<br>compression can be modified hop by hop (in contrast to the inner<br>end-to-end compression)?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  SCHC with CoAP will be used exactly the same way as it is applied in<br>&nbsp;  any protocol as IP or UDP with the difference that the fields<br>&nbsp;  description needs to be defined based on both headers and target<br>&nbsp;  values of the request and the responses.&nbsp; SCHC Rules description use<br><br>If there's a difference, it's not "exactly the same".<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return path (e.g. source and destination addresses fields).&nbsp;

 o&nbsp; Even when a field is "symmetric" (i.e. found in both directions)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the values carried in each direction are different.&nbsp; To performs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the compression a matching list in the TV might be use because<br><br>nit: "used".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; field two cases may be raised after applying the CDA: * The result<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the compression is of fixed length and the compressed value is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sent in the residue.&nbsp; * Or the result of the compression is of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; variable-length and in this case, the size is sent with the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compressed value in the residue.<br><br>[another presumed-markdown list, though this one might be easier to<br>reformat just as running text, since there are only two options]<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; In CoAP headers, a field can appear several times.&nbsp; This is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; typical for elements of a URI (path or queries).&nbsp; The SCHC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specification [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/">I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc</a>] allows a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Field ID to appears several times in the rule, and uses the Field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Position (FP) to identify the correct instance, and thereby<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; removing the ambiguity of the matching operation.<br><br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/">draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc</a> notes that there can be issues<br>when using a FP of zero for "don't care"; perhaps it's worth noting that<br>these issues are pretty certain to occur for URI-path?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Field sizes defined in the CoAP protocol can be too large<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regarding LPWAN traffic constraints.&nbsp; This is particularly true<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the Message ID field and the Token field.&nbsp; SCHC uses different<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Matching operators (MO) to performs the compression, see section<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.4 of [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/">I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc</a>].&nbsp; In this case the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most Significant Bits (MSB) MO can be applied to reduce the<br>&nbsp;

In essence, I<br>don't know that the "regarding LPWAN traffic constraints" is the most<br>effective language to use; emphasizing that the fields are large and<br>mostly unchanging, and that LPWAN needs to care about those wasted bits,<br>seems to be the important part.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 Token Length is processed as any protocol field.&nbsp; If the value does<br>&nbsp;  not change, the size can be stored in the TV and elided during the<br>&nbsp;  transmission.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will have to be sent in the compression<br>&nbsp;

 Length field.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand how these two parts fit together.&nbsp; I<br>understand that CoAP places a tight binding betwen the TKL value and the<br>length of the token field, and so if SCHC tried to treat them<br>differently we could break a CoAP invariant (this seems to be the<br>"ambiguity" that we seek to avoid, per the trimmed quote).&nbsp; But the last<br>part seems to say that the TKL function to give the actual token length<br>is part of the Rule, and the former part says that if the CoAP Token<br>Length is variable, it will be sent in the compression residue -- if the<br>Token Length is a compression residue then that seems to imply that it<br>is not fixed by the Rule, and thus I'm not sure what the procedure is<br>supposed to be with this "TKL function".&nbsp; Furthermore, I don't see<br>specification of the TKL function later in the document.&nbsp; I guess it's<br>supposed to take as input information from the Rule's definition and the<br>token length residue in order to output the length of the transmitted<br>token residue, but that does not seem very clearly spelled out.&nbsp;

The components of the target value must individually<br>match with the URI-Path field values in the indicated field positions.<br>Note specifically that the FP values, as indicated in the example, are<br>not required to be consecutive values;

Is it to say that you could<br>have a single rule that lists the maximum expected number of path<br>components, and then use "empty component"s to represent the compressed<br>form of shorter paths?&nbsp;

 The piv field lends itself to having a number of bits masked off with<br>&nbsp;  MO MSB and CDA LSB.&nbsp; This could be useful in applications where the<br>&nbsp;  message frequency is low such as that found in LPWAN technologies.<br>&nbsp;

 OSCORE compression is also based on the same compression method<br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/">I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc</a>].&nbsp; The size of<br>&nbsp;  the Initialisation Vector residue size must be considered carefully.<br><br>I suggest adding a note that there is a tradeoff between the efficiency<br>of compression and the number of protected messages that can be sent<br>using a given key/SCHC context; the following two sentences don't seem<br>as clear as they could be.&nbsp; So ...<br><br>&nbsp;  A too large value has a impact on the compression efficiency and a<br>&nbsp;  too small value will force the device to renew its key more often.<br>&nbsp;  This operation may be long and energy consuming.<br><br>Perhaps,<br><br>% The OSCORE initialization vector holds a message sequence number, and<br>% a unique such number is needed for each distinct message.&nbsp; The SCHC<br>% procedure gives compression efficiency by assuming that a fixed prefix<br>% of the IV remains static and eliding that fixed prefix from the<br>% transmitted message.&nbsp; However, such compression has the corresponding<br>% effect of reducing the number of distinct sequence numbers available<br>% to the sender.&nbsp; When the usable sequence number space is exhausted,<br>% the OSCORE security context must be rekeyed; since this rekeying can<br>% be an expensive operation in terms of time and energy consumption, the<br>% creation of SCHC Rules for OSCORE compression should take into<br>% consideration the tradeoff between (amortized )rekeying cost and the<br>% recurring transmission overhead for the uncompressed portion of the<br>% initialization vector.</div></td>
