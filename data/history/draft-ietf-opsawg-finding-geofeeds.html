Or re-word as “To prevent undue load on RPSL and geofeed servers, an entity fetching geofeed data using these mechanisms MUST NOT do frequent real-time look-ups.” (I also added “undue” because of course every transaction induces SOME load.)<br><br><br>6. General Comment:<br><br>While I notice some reviewers have expressed discomfort with the occasional lighthearted use of language (“fetching with tweezers”, etc), I found that it made the document more fun to read without hindering clarity in the slightest. In short, it made it a better spec. Thank you.</div></td>

For example,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; need for it.
