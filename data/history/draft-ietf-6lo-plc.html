I.e., is there the equivalent of a EtherType in a layer-2 PLC PDU ? Then, this should be mentioned in this document else some text explaining why it is not required would be welcome. Especially when the normative IEEE references are not freely available.<br><br>-- Section 4.1 --<br>I am repeating here Dave Thaler's point 1) as it is completely unclear to me how the shared secret/version number are shared and provisioned, this could prevent interoperation hence my DISCUSS.<br><br>While I appreciate that the nodes are constrained, some warnings about having a *single global IPv6 address* should be written or if the spec supports more than one global IPv6 address per node, then the current text must be changed.<br><br><br>== COMMENTS ==<br><br>A generic and probably naive question of mine: how can a PLC node (which has access to electrical power) can be qualified as 'low power' ? <br><br>-- Section 2 --<br><br>Please add references to the IEEE references before using them in the table 1.<br><br>-- Section 3.1 --<br><br>Is the I-D limited to TCP &amp; UDP only ?

 Since the derived Interface ID is not global, the "Universal/Local"<br>&nbsp;  (U/L) bit (7th bit) and the Individual/Group bit (8th bit) MUST both<br>&nbsp;  be set to zero.&nbsp; In order to avoid any ambiguity in the derived<br>&nbsp;  Interface ID, these two bits MUST NOT be used to generate the PANID<br>&nbsp;  (for IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903) or NID (for IEEE 1901.1).&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  other words, the PANID or NID MUST always be chosen so that these<br>&nbsp;  bits are zeros.<br><br>Is this a new requirement on the PANID/NID not already imposed by the<br>underlying specifications?&nbsp; If so, it seems that it presents a<br>limitation on the ability of already deployed PLC networks to adopt this<br>IPv6 adaptation layer.<br><br>&nbsp;  For privacy reasons, the IID derived from the MAC address SHOULD only<br>&nbsp;  be used for link-local address configuration.&nbsp; A PLC host SHOULD use<br>&nbsp;  the IID derived from the link-layer short address to configure the<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 address used for communication with the public network;<br>&nbsp;  otherwise, the host's MAC address is exposed.&nbsp; As per [<a href="/doc/rfc8065/">RFC8065</a>], when<br>&nbsp;  short addresses are used on PLC links, a shared secret key or version<br>&nbsp;  number from the Authoritative Border Router Option [<a href="/doc/rfc6775/">RFC6775</a>] can be<br>&nbsp;  used to improve the entropy of the hash input, thus the generated IID<br>&nbsp;  can be spread out to the full range of the IID address space while<br>&nbsp;  stateless address compression is still allowed.<br><br>The phrasing "derived from" is a little ambiguous to me, since it can<br>encompass procedures ranging from the "flip the U/L bit and append PLC<br>IID to the network's prefix" procedure to <a href="/doc/rfc7217/">RFC 7217</a>-style stable but<br>opaque IIDs that incorporate the MAC address into the pseudorandom<br>function's inputs.&nbsp; Given the follow-up text about "host's MAC address<br>is exposed", it feels like this is implying more of the former<br>procedure.&nbsp; Wouldn't the latter type of procedure be preferred, though<br>(as implied by the "hash input" in the last sentence)?&nbsp; In particular,<br>the last sentence seems to imply that there is *always* a hash input,<br>which is at odds with the "former" interpretation that I present for<br>"derived from".&nbsp; I'm not confident that I understand the intent of this<br>paragraph.<br><br>Section 4.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to avoid the possibility of duplicated IPv6 addresses, the<br>&nbsp;  value of the NID MUST be chosen so that the 7th and 8th bits of the<br>&nbsp;  first byte of the NID are both zero.<br><br>As above, it's not clear that the NID is something that this adaptation<br>layer can assert control over.<br><br>Section 4.3.2<br><br>&nbsp;

 [<a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC6282</a>] which specifies the compression format for IPv6 datagrams<br>&nbsp;  on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is the basis for IPv6 header compression in<br>&nbsp;  PLC.&nbsp; For situations when PLC MAC MTU cannot support the 1280-octet<br>&nbsp;  IPv6 packet, headers MUST be compressed according to [<a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC6282</a>]<br>&nbsp;  encoding formats.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC 6282</a> refers to both a "Dispatch" value and the LOWPAN_IPHC header<br>compression encoding.&nbsp; I strongly suggest clarifying whether both, or<br>just LOWPAN_IPHC, is used.<br><br>&nbsp;  For IEEE 1901.2 and G.9903, the IP header compression follows the<br>&nbsp;  instruction in [<a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC6282</a>].&nbsp; However, additional adaptation MUST be<br>&nbsp;  considered for IEEE 1901.1 since it has a short address of 12 bits<br>&nbsp;  instead of 16 bits.&nbsp; The only modification is the semantics of the<br>&nbsp;

 octects, the fragmentation and reassembly defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC4944</a>] MUST<br>&nbsp;  be used.<br><br>Does this imply that implementing the IPv6 adaptation layer<br>fragmentation+reassembly logic is mandatory for implementations of IPv6<br>over IEEE 1901.1 and 1901.2, since the implementation might be<br>configured in a way that requires that support?&nbsp;

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>[Shepherd response] Proposed Standard (the title page header reads “Standards Track”). This is the proper type of RFC because the document specifies the adaptation layer to support IPv6&nbsp; over various Power Line Communication (PLC) technologies.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines<br>&nbsp;  for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to<br>&nbsp;  support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart<br>&nbsp;  meters for electricity.&nbsp; The inherent advantage of existing<br>&nbsp;  electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC<br>&nbsp;  deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices<br>&nbsp;  raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained<br>&nbsp;  PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1 and IEEE 1901.2.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>There has been no particular WG controversy regarding this document. The document has progressed with WG consensus.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>There exists a production-quality implementation of this specification from a large vendor.<br>Michael Richardson provided a detailed review during the WGLC (which led to revisions -03 and -04), with a particular focus on security. His comments were satisfactorily addressed.<br><br>Personnel:<br>The document shepherd is Carles Gomez. The responsible AD is Erik Kline. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br>[Shepherd response] The shepherd reviewed version -04 of the draft. The shepherd’s comments were mostly editorial, although a few technical points were found as well. The authors updated the draft to address the shepherd’s comments, and produced revision -05. The shepherd believes that, in its current version (-05), the document is ready for being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br>[Shepherd response] No such concerns. The document has been discussed and presented at many IETF meetings, with significant progress happening through numerous updates even happening before the document became a WG document. Michael Richardson provided a detailed and comprehenseive review during WGLC, which led to updates -03 and -04.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br>[Shepherd response] No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br>[Shepherd response] No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>[Shepherd response] All authors have confirmed that they are not aware of any IPR that applies to this document. <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br>[Shepherd response] No IPR disclosure referencing this document has been filed. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br>[Shepherd response] There is good WG consensus behind this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>[Shepherd response] No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br>[Shepherd response] The Idnits tool indicates no errors or flaws. There are a few warnings and comments.

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br>[Shepherd response] All normative references have already been published.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br>[Shepherd response] There are no downward normative references in this document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br>[Shepherd response] This document does not update or change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br>[Shepherd response]&nbsp; This document requires no IANA actions.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br>[Shepherd response] N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br>[Shepherd response] N/A.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br>[Shepherd response] The document does not contain a YANG module.<br><br></div></td>
