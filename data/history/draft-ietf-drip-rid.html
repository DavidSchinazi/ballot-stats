As it says above:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; Only a small cache that contains the<br>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; HDA's HI/HHIT and HDA meta-data is needed by the Observer.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;

These can be dynamic,<br> &gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  but do not need to be.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Only the new Type-4, Session ID can support HHITs.&nbsp; Well your type-1 CTA <br>&gt; SN COULD be an encoded HHIT.<br><br>&gt; Do you feel that this information should be added or text saying that <br>&gt; HHIT is only used in type-4?<br><br>I would probably err on the side of saying less and make clear that only type-4 is relevant to HHIT.<br><br><br>&gt;

The DNS is a loosely coherent, scalable, distributed database with good performance and deployment -- but that doesn't mean that it should be overloaded to store $whatever - there is a complexity, scalability and monetary cost to running the system; it isn't a free, infinitely scalable resource, and we quickly get into a "tragedy of the commons" problem.<br><br><br>I have a few comments and questions related to this document:<br>1: "Address Block: IANA is requested to allocate a new 28-bit prefix out of the IANA IPv6 Special Purpose Address Block, namely 2001::/23, as per [<a href="/doc/rfc6890/">RFC6890</a>] (TBD6, suggested: 2001:30::/28)."<br>This seems like a *really* large block of addresses to be taking and using for this purpose - I understand that there is already some concern about the number of address bits being used for the crypto parts, but it does seem incredibly wasteful to be deciding to use this much of the IPv6 Special Purpose block for this -- there are only 32 /28s in the /23. Yes, IPv6 is large, but "no-one will need more that 640k of RAM", IPv4 was originally viewed as massive, etc --- this is 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 host addresses. <br><br>2: I have some reservations about how much this punts a large amount of work to the DNS -- "Note that if the zone <a href="http://hhit.arpa">hhit.arpa</a> is ultimately used, some registrar will need to manage this for all HHIT applications.", etc.&nbsp; Has there been discussion with the DNSOP WG about the potential load profile? And with the IAB about having an entry under .arpa for this? This does feel somewhat like the well known "just put it in the DNS"-type solution (see slide 13 here). Yes, the DNS is an incredibly good, well scaling solution, but there are costs, and I think that more investigation into how this gets used without just shifting costs to someone else is needed. This is repeated in things like "A DET reverse lookup could be to: <a href="http://a69e.ad0.1952.a3ad.1405.280.30.2001.20.10.det.arpa">a69e.ad0.1952.a3ad.1405.280.30.2001.20.10.det.arpa</a>. or: <a href="http://a3ad1952ad0a69e.5.20.10.30.2001.det.remoteid.icao.int">a3ad1952ad0a69e.5.20.10.30.2001.det.remoteid.icao.int</a>." - yes, it *could* be, but this feels like it is assuming that .arpa or .icao.int is happy to serve this function, have the registry, etc.</div></td>

In §3.2,<br><br>&nbsp;  The following HHIT Suite IDs are defined:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HHIT Suite&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RESERVED&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RSA,DSA/SHA-256&nbsp; &nbsp;  1&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7401/">RFC7401</a>]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ECDSA/SHA-384&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  2&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7401/">RFC7401</a>]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ECDSA_LOW/SHA-1&nbsp; &nbsp;  3&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7401/">RFC7401</a>]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EdDSA/cSHAKE128&nbsp; &nbsp;  TBD3 (suggested value 5)&nbsp;  (RECOMMENDED)<br><br>What, exactly, does the notation "RECOMMENDED" on the last quoted line mean? AFAICT there's no unambiguous way to parse this. My guess is that it's meant to mean "this is the suite we think you should use". Whatever the intended meaning, please elaborate to make the meaning clear. I suggest removing the notation from the table, and providing prose in some appropriate section instead, with "RECOMMENDED" if you think the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword is needed. If desired, you could xref that section from the table, although I don't think that's really necessary.<br><br>This comment also applies to the similar lines in §3.4.1, §3.4.1.1, and §3.4.2. The use in §3.4.1.1 is especially confounding, since the prose right before the table tells us that (all of) "the following EdDSA curves are required" (but evidently not REQUIRED)... but only some of the required curves are RECOMMENDED? I definitely have no clue, then, what "RECOMMENDED" means in this section. <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> basically defines RECOMMENDED as a weaker form of REQUIRED, but that doesn't seem to be how you're using it.<br><br>Similarly, I have no clue what "RECOMMENDED" is meant to mean in its several uses in §8.2 and §8.4. I suggest simply removing it from those sections entirely.<br><br>(Taken together, this comment covers every use of RECCOMMENDED in the document.)<br><br>Comments:<br><br>2. Please define "CAA", either by expanding on first use (in §3.3) or in your Definitions section.<br><br>3. I assume the "middle L-bit-long bitstring" thing you mention in various places is some well-known phrasing, but it's not something I'm familiar with, so please humor me by explaining what it would mean in the case where the argument bitstring is of even length and L is an odd number, or vice-versa? For example, consider the argument 0101 and L = 1. What's the "middle" value? Should this be clarified in this document, either by defining in-line or by reference to a document that does define it?<br><br>4. The document uses the term "unmanned" in various places, including its title. As you're probably aware, "The IESG [...] encourages IETF participants to use the guidance in [NISTIR8366] when making contributions to the IETF." (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/</a>)<br><br>It looks as though the aviation community is aware that "unmanned" isn't as inclusive as would be desirable (e.g., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/</a>, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting</a>) but just as in other industries, is still in the process of revising its document set.<br><br>I'm guessing the uses of "unmanned" in this document have been considered already and are necessary because they flow from definitions elsewhere, which have not been revised? If there is any space to move to more inclusive terminology, that would seem to be desirable. (E.g. "uncrewed" wouldn't even require an acronym change.)<br><br>5. Not a big deal considering you're describing another organization's format, not defining your own, but in §4.2,<br><br>&nbsp;  Encoding an HHIT within the CTA 2063-A format is not simple.&nbsp; The CTA<br>&nbsp;  2063-A format is defined as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;  Serial Number&nbsp;  :=&nbsp; MFR Code | Length Code | MFR SN<br><br>The flow and clarity would be better (IMO) if you stated in the "Encoding..." sentence what alphabet the format is defined over. From context I infer the alphabet is US-ASCII?<br><br>6. I am curious, in §4.6, you've capitalized "Observers" (and "Observer") as a proper noun, but there's no definition of it elsewhere. Is the capitalization in error, or should the term be defined? (A cursory look at [drip-authentication] suggests maybe that's where the term comes from, maybe an xref from your definitions section?)<br><br>7. Similarly, for capitalized "Pilot" in §6.<br><br>8. You create several registries with Expert Review policy. <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a> §4.5 asks that:<br><br>&nbsp;  The required documentation and review criteria, giving clear guidance<br>&nbsp;  to the designated expert, should be provided when defining the<br>&nbsp;  registry.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  <br>Please review <a href="/doc/rfc8216/">RFC 8216</a> §4.5 (it's short) and ensure you've taken care of what's asked for there.<br><br>NITS:<br><br>9. In §3.4, is it "Edward-Curve", or "Edwards-Curve"? Please fix as appropriate.<br><br>10.

Please define "CAA", either by expanding on first use (in §3.3) or in your Definitions section.<br><br>3. I assume the "middle L-bit-long bitstring" thing you mention in various places is some well-known phrasing, but it's not something I'm familiar with, so please humor me by explaining what it would mean in the case where the argument bitstring is of even length and L is an odd number, or vice-versa? For example, consider the argument 0101 and L = 1. What's the "middle" value? Should this be clarified in this document, either by defining in-line or by reference to a document that does define it?<br><br>4. The document uses the term "unmanned" in various places, including its title. As you're probably aware, "The IESG [...] encourages IETF participants to use the guidance in [NISTIR8366] when making contributions to the IETF." (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/</a>)<br><br>It looks as though the aviation community is aware that "unmanned" isn't as inclusive as would be desirable (e.g., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/</a>, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting</a>) but just as in other industries, is still in the process of revising its document set.<br><br>I'm guessing the uses of "unmanned" in this document have been considered already and are necessary because they flow from definitions elsewhere, which have not been revised? If there is any space to move to more inclusive terminology, that would seem to be desirable. (E.g. "uncrewed" wouldn't even require an acronym change.)<br><br>5. Not a big deal considering you're describing another organization's format, not defining your own, but in §4.2,<br><br>&nbsp;  Encoding an HHIT within the CTA 2063-A format is not simple.&nbsp; The CTA<br>&nbsp;  2063-A format is defined as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;  Serial Number&nbsp;  :=&nbsp; MFR Code | Length Code | MFR SN<br><br>The flow and clarity would be better (IMO) if you stated in the "Encoding..." sentence what alphabet the format is defined over. From context I infer the alphabet is US-ASCII?<br><br>6. I am curious, in §4.6, you've capitalized "Observers" (and "Observer") as a proper noun, but there's no definition of it elsewhere.

Whatever the intended meaning, please elaborate to make the meaning clear. I suggest removing the notation from the table, and providing prose in some appropriate section instead, with "RECOMMENDED" if you think the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keyword is needed.

The use in §3.4.1.1 is especially confounding, since the prose right before the table tells us that (all of) "the following EdDSA curves are required" (but evidently not REQUIRED)... but only some of the required curves are RECOMMENDED? I definitely have no clue, then, what "RECOMMENDED" means in this section. <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> basically defines RECOMMENDED as a weaker form of REQUIRED, but that doesn't seem to be how you're using it.<br><br>Similarly, I have no clue what "RECOMMENDED" is meant to mean in its several uses in §8.2 and §8.4.

For example, consider the argument 0101 and L = 1. What's the "middle" value? Should this be clarified in this document? <br><br>4. The document uses the term "unmanned" in various places, including its title. As you're probably aware, "The IESG [...] encourages IETF participants to use the guidance in [NISTIR8366] when making contributions to the IETF." (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/</a>)<br><br>It looks as though the aviation community is aware that "unmanned" isn't as inclusive as would be desirable (e.g., <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/06/23/faa-gender-neutral-language/</a>, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/26/2021-23280/notice-of-public-meeting</a>) but just as in other industries, is still in the process of revising its document set.<br><br>I'm guessing the uses of "unmanned" in this document have been considered already and are necessary because they flow from definitions elsewhere, which have not been revised? If there is any space to move to more inclusive terminology, that would seem to be desirable. (E.g. "uncrewed" wouldn't even require an acronym change.)<br><br>5. Not a big deal considering you're describing another organization's format, not defining your own, but in §4.2,<br><br>&nbsp;  Encoding an HHIT within the CTA 2063-A format is not simple.&nbsp; The CTA<br>&nbsp;  2063-A format is defined as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;  Serial Number&nbsp;  :=&nbsp; MFR Code | Length Code | MFR SN<br><br>The flow would be better (IMO) if you stated in the "Encoding..." sentence what alphabet the format is defined over. From context I infer the alphabet is US-ASCII?<br><br>6. I am curious, in §4.6, you've capitalized "Observers" (and "Observer") as a proper noun, but there's no definition of it elsewhere. Is the capitalization in error, or should the term be defined? (A cursory look at [drip-authentication] suggests maybe that's where the term comes from, maybe an xref from your definitions section?)<br><br>7. Similarly, for capitalized "Pilot" in §6.<br><br>8. You have several registries with Expert Review policy. <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a> §4.5 asks that:<br><br>&nbsp;  The required documentation and review criteria, giving clear guidance<br>&nbsp;  to the designated expert, should be provided when defining the<br>&nbsp;  registry.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  <br>Please review <a href="/doc/rfc8216/">RFC 8216</a> §4.5 (it's short) and ensure you've taken care of what's asked for there.<br><br>NITS:<br><br>9. In §3.4, is it "Edward-Curve", or "Edwards-Curve"? Please fix as appropriate.<br><br>10. In §3.5.1, <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Care<br>&nbsp;  must be considering the size of the hash portion<br>&nbsp;  <br>Something's missing here. Perhaps "Care must be taken considering..."?<br><br>11. In §4.2,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Definition of this<br>&nbsp;  mapping service is currently out of scope of this document.<br>&nbsp;  <br>I think you can drop "currently" considering you're going to press as an RFC.</div></td>

Yes, IPv6 is large, but "no-one will need more that 640k of RAM", IPv4 was originally viewed as massive, etc --- this is 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 host addresses. <br><br>2: I have some reservations about how much this punts a large amount of work to the DNS -- "Note that if the zone <a href="http://hhit.arpa">hhit.arpa</a> is ultimately used, some registrar will need to manage this for all HHIT applications.", etc.&nbsp; Has there been discussion with the DNSOP WG about the potential load profile? And with the IAB about having an entry under .arpa for this? This does feel somewhat like the well known "just put it in the DNS"-type solution (see slide 13 here). Yes, the DNS is an incredibly good, well scaling solution, but there are costs, and I think that more investigation into how this gets used without just shifting costs to someone else is needed. This is repeated in things like "A DET reverse lookup could be to: <a href="http://a69e.ad0.1952.a3ad.1405.280.30.2001.20.10.det.arpa">a69e.ad0.1952.a3ad.1405.280.30.2001.20.10.det.arpa</a>. or: <a href="http://a3ad1952ad0a69e.5.20.10.30.2001.det.remoteid.icao.int">a3ad1952ad0a69e.5.20.10.30.2001.det.remoteid.icao.int</a>." - yes, it *could* be, but this feels like it is assuming that .arpa or .icao.int is happy to serve this function, have the registry, etc.</div></td>

 (Sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 of [drip-authentication]) implicitly<br>&nbsp;  provide this self-attestation.&nbsp; A lookup service like DNS can provide<br>&nbsp;  the HI and registration proof (GEN-3 in [<a href="/doc/rfc9153/">RFC9153</a>]).<br><br>&nbsp;  Similarly, for Observers without Internet access, a 200-byte offline<br>&nbsp;  self-attestation could provide the same Remote ID ownership proof.<br>&nbsp;  This attestation would contain the HDA's signing of the UA's HHIT,<br>&nbsp;  itself signed by the UA's HI.&nbsp; Only a small cache that contains the<br>&nbsp;  HDA's HI/HHIT and HDA meta-data is needed by the Observer.&nbsp; However,<br>&nbsp;  such an object would just fit in the ASTM Authentication Message<br>&nbsp;  (Section 2.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9153/">RFC9153</a>]) with no room for growth.&nbsp; In practice,<br>&nbsp;  [drip-authentication] provides this offline self-attestation in two<br>&nbsp;  authentication messages: the HDA's certification of the UA's HHIT<br>&nbsp;  registration in a Link authentication message whose hash is sent in a<br>&nbsp;  Manifest authentication message.<br><br>I’m having trouble following along on where the guidance for offline verification is described – who exactly signs what with what key and in what format is this stored.&nbsp;

Practically, why isn’t this a MUST?<br><br>** Section 9.5.<br><br>&nbsp;  The UAS/USS registration<br>&nbsp;  process should include registering the DET and MUST reject a<br>&nbsp;  collision, forcing the UAS to generate a new HI and thus HHIT and<br>&nbsp;

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  approved documents. The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  This document specifies DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) that are used for<br>&nbsp;  drone identification purposes (a.k.a., UAS Remote ID). DETs rely<br>&nbsp;  upon Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) which are defined as<br>&nbsp;  self-asserting IPv6 addresses. Also, these HHITs include explicit<br>&nbsp;  hierarchy to enable DNS queries and discovery of specific registrars<br>&nbsp;  for 3rd-party identification attestation purposes.<br><br> Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document ran 8 versions before adoption by the WG (including a<br>&nbsp;  version that passed surprisingly through without any validation by <br>&nbsp;  the submission part of the datatracker and published as draft-ietf-drip-*;<br>&nbsp;  see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid/history/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid/history/</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  Regular slots were dedicated to this draft in several WG meetings.<br>&nbsp;  The authors implemented the outcomes of the discussions held in these<br>&nbsp;  meetings and the mailing list. <br><br>&nbsp;  Once the draft was adopted, a note was sent to HIPSEC mailing<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  hipsec/2ojLTMCR7-YKQ5RJ68pBABF4mSY/) to check if there are any issues<br>&nbsp;  with the specification (HIP part), but no follow up message was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Early SECDIR and IOTDIR reviews were requested by the Chairs against<br>&nbsp;  -07. These reviews were addressed by the authors.<br><br>&nbsp;  As suggested by the SECDIR reviewer, a review request was sent to the<br>&nbsp;  CFRG for review (31/08/2021). A discussion in the CFRG mailing list<br>&nbsp;  was then triggered: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  cfrg/56XscYjs_GprhS0wxvVDWNincPg/ (09/2021) with the outcomes<br>&nbsp;  implemented in -11.<br><br>&nbsp;  A note was also sent to SAAG to seek for reviews, especially the<br>&nbsp;  privacy section (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  saag/5tyVqtjCGKVcSeX9gpS4_feI7YQ/). No follow up message was received :-(<br><br>&nbsp;  The draft used to include some actions on behalf of the ICAO (RAA<br>&nbsp;  assignment, for example), while these are not formally discussed by<br>&nbsp;  the WG. These statements were removed and an action plan was agreed.<br><br>&nbsp;  The WG agreed that no RAA assignment policy will be included in this<br>&nbsp;  document. Such considerations (e.g., whether to abandon the control on<br>&nbsp;  the RAA assignment bound to the IANA-assigned prefix or keep the full<br>&nbsp;  control but have a provision for some delegation) will be covered in<br>&nbsp;  draft-ietf-drip-registries. From an interoperability, this plan is OK<br>&nbsp;  as DETs are unambiguously identified by the prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a concern whether /28 prefix is sufficient to cover any<br>&nbsp;  HHIT needs, not only DETs. The main outcomes were:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The IPv6 prefix is for DRIP use and, as such, the requested prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; size is reasonable.

Why<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp;  This document requests publication as a Proposed Standard RFC. That<br>&nbsp;  is indicated on the header page. The intended status is justified<br>&nbsp;  given that the document (1) specifies a modified version of host<br>&nbsp;  identity tags (initially defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7401/">RFC 7401</a> that was published in<br>&nbsp;  Standards Track) and (2) updates <a href="/doc/rfc7343/">RFC 7343</a> (also published in the<br>&nbsp;  Standards Track).<br><br> (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  approved documents. The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  This document specifies DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) that are used for<br>&nbsp;  drone identification purposes (a.k.a., UAS Remote ID). DETs rely<br>&nbsp;  upon Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) which are defined as<br>&nbsp;  self-asserting IPv6 addresses. Also, these HHITs include explicit<br>&nbsp;  hierarchy to enable DNS queries and discovery of specific registrars<br>&nbsp;  for 3rd-party identification attestation purposes.<br><br> Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document ran 8 versions before adoption by the WG (including a<br>&nbsp;  version that passed surprisingly through without any validation and<br>&nbsp;  published as draft-ietf-drip-*).<br><br>&nbsp;  Regular slots were dedicated to this draft in several WG meetings.<br>&nbsp;  The authors implemented the outcomes of the discussions held in these<br>&nbsp;  meetings and the mailing list. <br><br>&nbsp;  Once the draft was adopted, a note was sent to HIPSEC mailing<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  hipsec/2ojLTMCR7-YKQ5RJ68pBABF4mSY/) to check if there are any issues<br>&nbsp;  with the specification (HIP part), but no follow up message was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Early SECDIR and IOTDIR reviews were requested by the Chairs against<br>&nbsp;  -07. These reviews were addressed by the authors.<br><br>&nbsp;  As suggested by the SECDIR reviewer, a review request was sent to the<br>&nbsp;  CFRG for review (31/08/2021). A discussion in the CFRG mailing list<br>&nbsp;  was then triggered: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  cfrg/56XscYjs_GprhS0wxvVDWNincPg/ (09/2021) with the outcomes<br>&nbsp;  implemented in -11.<br><br>&nbsp;  A note was also sent to SAAG to seek for reviews, especially the<br>&nbsp;  privacy section (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  saag/5tyVqtjCGKVcSeX9gpS4_feI7YQ/). No follow up message was received :-(<br><br>&nbsp;  The draft used to include some actions on behalf of the ICAO (RAA<br>&nbsp;  assignment, for example), while these are not formally discussed by<br>&nbsp;  the WG. These statements were removed and an action plan was agreed.<br><br>&nbsp;  The WG agreed that no RAA assignment policy will be included in this<br>&nbsp;  document. Such considerations (e.g., whether to abandon the control on<br>&nbsp;  the RAA assignment bound to the IANA-assigned prefix or keep the full<br>&nbsp;  control but have a provision for some delegation) will be covered in<br>&nbsp;  draft-ietf-drip-registries. From an interoperability, this plan is OK<br>&nbsp;  as DETs are unambiguously identified by the prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a concern whether /28 prefix is sufficient to cover any<br>&nbsp;  HHIT needs, not only DETs. The main outcomes were:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The IPv6 prefix is for DRIP use and, as such, the requested prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; size is reasonable. This block should be named "DRIP Device<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entity Tags (DETs) Prefix" to avoid any confusion.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Maintain the request for the IANA /28 prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Add a provision for the use of other prefixes, including network-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specific prefixes.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; To unambiguously identify a DET, create a new registry to list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prefixes used for DET purposes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Some issues were reported by IANA against -13: add a registration<br>&nbsp;  procedure for the new EdDSA Curve Label registry, indicate the upper<br>&nbsp;  boundary for the registry's Value field, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 discuss HIP parameters that are impacted<br>&nbsp;  as a side effect of defining EdDSA as a HI algorithm.&nbsp; These<br>&nbsp;  parameters are not needed for DRIP.

Is this type of RFC indicated in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp;  This document requests publication as a Proposed Standard RFC. That<br>&nbsp;  is indicated on the header page. The intended status is justified<br>&nbsp;  given that the document (1) specifies a modified version of host<br>&nbsp;  identity tags (initially defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7401/">RFC 7401</a> that was published in<br>&nbsp;  Standards Track) and (2) updates <a href="/doc/rfc7343/">RFC 7343</a> (also published in the<br>&nbsp;  Standards Track).<br><br> (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  approved documents. The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  This document specifies DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) that are used for<br>&nbsp;  drone identification purposes (a.k.a., UAS Remote ID). DETs rely<br>&nbsp;  upon Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) which are defined as<br>&nbsp;  self-asserting IPv6 addresses. Also, these HHITs include explicit<br>&nbsp;  hierarchy to enable DNS queries and discovery of specific registrars<br>&nbsp;  for 3rd-party identification attestation purposes.<br><br> Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document ran 8 versions before adoption by the WG (including a<br>&nbsp;  version that passed surprisingly through without any validation and<br>&nbsp;  published as draft-ietf-drip-*).<br><br>&nbsp;  Regular slots were dedicated to this draft in several WG meetings.<br>&nbsp;  The authors implemented the outcomes of the discussions held in these<br>&nbsp;  meetings and the mailing list. <br><br>&nbsp;  Once the draft was adopted, a note was sent to HIPSEC mailing<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  hipsec/2ojLTMCR7-YKQ5RJ68pBABF4mSY/) to check if there are any issues<br>&nbsp;  with the specification (HIP part), but no follow up message was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Early SECDIR and IOTDIR reviews were requested by the Chairs against<br>&nbsp;  -07. These reviews were addressed by the authors.<br><br>&nbsp;  As suggested by the SECDIR reviewer, a review request was sent to the<br>&nbsp;  CFRG for review (31/08/2021). A discussion in the CFRG mailing list<br>&nbsp;  was then triggered: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  cfrg/56XscYjs_GprhS0wxvVDWNincPg/ (09/2021) with the outcomes<br>&nbsp;  implemented in -11.<br><br>&nbsp;  A note was also sent to SAAG to seek for reviews, especially the<br>&nbsp;  privacy section (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  saag/5tyVqtjCGKVcSeX9gpS4_feI7YQ/). No follow up message was received :-(<br><br>&nbsp;  The draft used to include some actions on behalf of the ICAO (RAA<br>&nbsp;  assignment, for example), while these are not formally discussed by<br>&nbsp;  the WG.

The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  This document specifies DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) that are used for<br>&nbsp;  drone identification purposes (a.k.a., UAS Remote ID). DETs rely<br>&nbsp;  upon Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) which are defined as<br>&nbsp;  self-asserting IPv6 addresses. Also, these HHITs include explicit<br>&nbsp;  hierarchy to enable DNS queries and discovery of specific registrars<br>&nbsp;  for 3rd-party identification attestation purposes.<br><br> Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document ran 8 versions before adoption by the WG (including a<br>&nbsp;  version that passed surprisingly through without any validation and<br>&nbsp;  published as <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid/">draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  Regular slots were dedicated to this draft in several WG meetings.<br>&nbsp;  The authors implemented the outcomes of the discussions held in these<br>&nbsp;  meetings and the mailing list. <br><br>&nbsp;  Once the draft was adopted, a note was sent to HIPSEC mailing<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  hipsec/2ojLTMCR7-YKQ5RJ68pBABF4mSY/) to check if there are any issues<br>&nbsp;  with the specification, but no follow up message was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Early SECDIR and IOTDIR reviews were requested by the Chairs against<br>&nbsp;  -07. These reviews were addressed by the authors.<br><br>&nbsp;  As suggested by the SECDIR reviewer, a review request was sent to the<br>&nbsp;  CFRG for review (31/08/2021). A discussion in the CFRG mailing list<br>&nbsp;  was then triggered: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  cfrg/56XscYjs_GprhS0wxvVDWNincPg/ (09/2021) with the outcomes<br>&nbsp;  implemented in -11.<br><br>&nbsp;  A note was also sent to SAAG to seek for reviews, especially the<br>&nbsp;  privacy section (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  saag/5tyVqtjCGKVcSeX9gpS4_feI7YQ/). No follow up message was received :-(<br><br>&nbsp;  The draft used to include some actions on behalf of the ICAO (RAA<br>&nbsp;  assignment, for example) while these are not formally discussed by<br>&nbsp;  the WG. These statements were removed and an action plan was agreed.<br><br>&nbsp;  The WG agreed that no RAA assignment policy will be included in this<br>&nbsp;  document.

The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br> Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  This document specifies DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) that are used for<br>&nbsp;  drone identification purposes (a.k.a., UAS Remote ID). DETs rely<br>&nbsp;  upon Hierarchical Host Identity Tags (HHITs) which are defined as<br>&nbsp;  self-asserting IPv6 addresses. Also, these HHITs include explicit<br>&nbsp;  hierarchy to enable DNS queries and discovery of specific registrars<br>&nbsp;  for 3rd-party identification attestation purposes.<br><br> Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document ran 8 versions before adoption by the WG (including a<br>&nbsp;  version that passed surprisingly through without any validation and<br>&nbsp;  published as <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid/">draft-ietf-drip-uas-rid</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  Regular slots were dedicated to this draft in several WG meetings.<br>&nbsp;  The authors implemented the outcomes of the discussions held in these<br>&nbsp;  meetings and the mailing list. <br><br>&nbsp;  Once the draft was adopted, a note was sent to HIPSEC mailing<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  hipsec/2ojLTMCR7-YKQ5RJ68pBABF4mSY/) to check if there are any issues<br>&nbsp;  with the specification, but no follow up message was received.<br><br>&nbsp;  Early SECDIR and IOTDIR reviews were requested by the Chairs against<br>&nbsp;  -07. These reviews were addressed by the authors.<br><br>&nbsp;  As suggested by the SECDIR reviewer, a review request was sent to the<br>&nbsp;  CFRG for review (31/08/2021). A discussion in the CFRG mailing list<br>&nbsp;  was then triggered: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  cfrg/56XscYjs_GprhS0wxvVDWNincPg/ (09/2021) with the outcomes<br>&nbsp;  implemented in -11.<br><br>&nbsp;  A note was also sent to SAAG to seek for reviews, especially the<br>&nbsp;  privacy section (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/</a><br>&nbsp;  saag/5tyVqtjCGKVcSeX9gpS4_feI7YQ/). No follow up message was received :-(<br><br>&nbsp;  The draft used to include some actions on behalf of the ICAO (RAA<br>&nbsp;  assignment, for example) while these are not formally discussed by<br>&nbsp;  the WG. These statements were removed and an action plan was agreed.<br><br>&nbsp;  The WG agreed that no RAA assignment policy will be included in this<br>&nbsp;  document. Such considerations (e.g., whether to abandon the control on<br>&nbsp;  the RAA assignment bound to the IANA-assigned prefix or keep the full<br>&nbsp;  control but have a provision for some delegation) will be covered in<br>&nbsp;  draft-ietf-drip-registries. From an interperiablity, this plan is OK<br>&nbsp;  as DETs are unambiguously identified by the prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a concern whether /28 prefix is sufficient to cover any<br>&nbsp;  HHIT needs, not only DETs. The main outcomes were:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The IPv6 prefix is for DRIP use and, as such, the requested prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; size is reasonable. This block should be named "DRIP Device<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entity Tags (DETs) Prefix" to avoid any confusion.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Maintain the request for the IANA /28 prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Add a provision for the use of other prefixes, including network-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specific prefixes.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; To unambiguously identify a DET, create a new registry to list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prefixes used for DET purposes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Some issues were reported by IANA against -13: add a registration<br>&nbsp;  procedure for the new EdDSA Curve Label registry, indicate the upper<br>&nbsp;  boundary for the registry's Value field, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 discuss HIP parameters that are impacted<br>&nbsp;  as a side effect of defining EdDSA as a HI algorithm.&nbsp; These<br>&nbsp;  parameters are not needed for DRIP. The draft includes two notes to<br>&nbsp;  make this clear enough.<br><br>&nbsp;  At least two implementations were reported to the WG, one of them is<br>&nbsp;  proprietary.<br><br> Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp;  The various reviews helped to enhance the quality of the document.<br><br> Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Mohamed Boucadair <br><br>&nbsp;  The Responsible Area Director is Eric Vyncke <br><br> (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the Document Shepherd.<br><br>&nbsp;  At least three detailed reviews were made by the Document Shepherd:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; -07: <a href="https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/">https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; draft-ietf-drip-rid-07-rev%20Med.pdf<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; -13: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reviews/master/draft-ietf-drip-rid-13-rev%20Med.pdf<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; -18: <a href="https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/raw/master/">https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/raw/master/</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; draft-ietf-drip-rid-18-rev%20Med.pdf<br><br>&nbsp; The authors have taken into account these various reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; This version is ready for publication.<br><br> (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No concern. <br><br> (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  broader perspective.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and/or the IESG should be aware of?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br> (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br></div></td>

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.
