on the contrary, [LWIG-VRB] is preetty<br>clear that there may be a need to slice up fragments along the way and<br>carry a "tail" of a previous fragment that gets inserted into the<br>beginning of the next fragment.&nbsp; I would suggest tweaking the<br>Introduction slightly to avoid the misreading that I fell into, perhaps<br>by s/whereby an intermediate node forwards a fragment as soon as it is<br>received if the next hop is a similar 6LoWPAN link/whereby an<br>intermediate node forwards a fragment (or the bulk thereof, MTU<br>permitting) as soon as it is received if the next hop is a similar<br>6LoWPAN link/.&nbsp; It might also be possible to note in the definition of<br>"fragment_offset" that it applies only to a given hop/transmission, and<br>that the packet's fragmentation could be adjusted at each intermediate<br>node.&nbsp; I'd also suggest expanding on the need for "a buffer for the<br>remainder of a previous fragment left to be sent" in Section 5.<br><br>The shepherd writeup indicates that, after Dave Thaler's review, there<br>was a perceived need to provide normative protocol specification in this<br>document for "how to do fragment forwarding"; Section 6 seems to be the<br>closest thing to that, but is not really such a specification.&nbsp; Some<br>further clarity on subsequent evolution of the WG's goals and<br>whether/why such protocol specification is no longer needed in this<br>document would be appreciated.&nbsp; In particular, it's not clear (anymore?)<br>why VRB is so privileged to get its own section, when there are<br>alternative approaches.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document introduces the capability to forward 6LoWPAN fragments.<br>&nbsp;  This method reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability<br>&nbsp;  in route-over forwarding.&nbsp; It is the companion to using virtual<br>&nbsp;  reassembly buffers which is a pure implementation technique.<br><br>nit: I don't really see what sense of "companion" is supposed to apply,<br>here; perhaps a different word would work better?&nbsp; (In my head, VRB is<br>an "incarnation" of the generic "fragment forwarding technique", which<br>would be a bit more churn than just swapping out one word here.)<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification provides a generic overview of FF, discusses<br>&nbsp;  advantages and caveats, and introduces a particular 6LoWPAN Fragment<br>&nbsp;  Forwarding technique called Virtual Reassembly Buffer that can be<br>&nbsp;  used while conserving the message formats defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC4944</a>].<br><br>nit: I'd double-check that "conserving" is the intended meaning; to my<br>ignorant eye "retaining" or "preserving" would be more appropriate.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  "IP Fragmentation Considered Fragile" [FRAG-ILE] discusses security<br>&nbsp;  threats that are linked to using IP fragmentation.&nbsp; The 6LoWPAN<br>&nbsp;  fragmentation takes place underneath, but some issues described there<br>&nbsp;  may still apply to 6LoWPAN fragments (as discussed in further details<br>&nbsp;  in Section 7).<br><br>nit: I think "underneath the IP layer"?<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  6LoWPAN endpoints:&nbsp; The 6LoWPAN endpoints are the first and last<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nodes in an unbroken string of 6LoWPAN nodes.&nbsp; They are in charge<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of generating or expanding a 6LoWPAN header from/to a full IPv6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packet.&nbsp; They are also the points where the fragmentation and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reassembly operations take place.<br><br>nit: I think they are only "the [only] points" where<br>fragmentation/reassembly happen if the entire newtork is using fragment<br>forwarding; in other cases some intermediate nodes will also reassemble<br>and (re)fragment.<br><br>&nbsp;  fragment_offset:&nbsp; The offset of a fragment of a datagram in its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compressed Form.&nbsp; The fragment_offset is expressed in a unit that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; depends on the MAC layer technology and is by default a byte.<br><br>(The same unit as the datagram_size, I trust.)<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  Node A starts by compacting the IPv6 packet using the header<br>&nbsp;  compression mechanism defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC6282</a>].&nbsp; If the resulting 6LoWPAN<br><br>The previous discussion implies that A at least sometimes is starting<br>from an existing 6LoWPAN compressed-form packet (as opposed to a fully<br>expanded IPv6 packet); would "(if needed)" be appropriate?&nbsp; (Perhaps I'm<br>misreading this implication into things.)<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  the destination.&nbsp; Upon a first fragment, a forwarding node (e.g. node<br>&nbsp;  B in a A-&gt;B-&gt;C sequence) that does fragment forwarding MUST attempt<br>&nbsp;  to create a state and forward the fragment.&nbsp; This is an atomic<br><br>There seems to be a verb missing here ("Upon receiving"?).<br><br>&nbsp;  Consecutive fragments of a same datagram must be separated with an<br>&nbsp;  inter-frame gap that allows one fragment to progress before the next<br>&nbsp;  shows up.&nbsp; This can be achieved by interleaving packets or fragments<br>&nbsp;  sent via different next-hop routers.<br><br>What's the tradeoff on making this "must be separated" vs. "MUST be<br>separated"?&nbsp; (Do we want exactly a one-frame gap or a gap of at least<br>one frame?)<br><br>Section 6<br><br>Would it be appropriate to transition from the previous sentence by<br>saying that "VRB is a particular incarnation of a 6LoWPAN Fragment<br>Forwarding technique" as the second sentence of the first paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;  The severity and occurrence of these caveats depends on the Link-<br>&nbsp;  Layer used.&nbsp; Whether they are acceptable depends entirely on the<br>&nbsp;  requirements the application places on the network.<br><br>I wish we could give more guidance on how to make these decisions, but I<br>can't think of anything specific to say.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>I guess the [FRAG-ILE] discussion of reassembly errors at high data<br>rates are not applicable here, because "high data rate" and "low-power<br>and lossy network" do not go together?<br><br>&nbsp;

but there is no known firewall operation that would work on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6LoWPAN fragments at the time of this writing, so the exposure is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; limited.&nbsp; An implementation of a firewall SHOULD NOT forward<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fragments but recompose the IP packet, check it in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uncompressed form, and then forward it again as fragments if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; necessary.<br><br>This is implicit about how the checked version of the packet is the one<br>that gets refragmented and forwarded, but also does not say what the<br>firewall should do when it receives overlapping fragments, particularly<br>ones that disagree about the payload.&nbsp; It seems worth remedying that.<br>Also, nit: s/but recompose/but instead should recompose/.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Resource exhaustion attacks are certainly possible and a sensitive<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; issue in a constrained network.&nbsp; An attacker can perform a Denial-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of-Service (DoS) attack on a node implementing VRB by generating a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; large number of bogus first fragments without sending subsequent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fragments.&nbsp; This causes the VRB table to fill up.&nbsp; When hop-by-hop<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reassembly is used, the same attack can be more damaging if the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node allocates a full datagram_size for each bogus first fragment.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the VRB, the attack can be performed remotely on all nodes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; along a path, but each node suffers a lesser hit.&nbsp; This is because<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the VRB does not need to remember the full datagram as received so<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; far but only possibly a few octets from the last fragment that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; could not fit in it.&nbsp; An implementation MUST protect itself to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keep the number of VRBs within capacity, and ensure that old VRBs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are protected by a timer of a reasonable duration for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; technology and destroyed upon timeout.<br><br>I think it would definitely be appropriate to mention that participants<br>in a 6LoWPAN network have authenticated to the network, and potentially<br>also the ability to blacklist misbehaving nodes.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Attacks based on predictable fragment identification values are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; also possible but can be avoided.&nbsp; The datagram_tag SHOULD be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assigned pseudo-randomly in order to defeat such attacks.<br><br>I think it would be worth mentioning the size of the datagram_tag field<br>and the corresponding impact on the attacker's ability to succeed at<br>guessing it.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Evasion of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) leverages<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ambiguity in the reassembly of the fragment.&nbsp; This is difficult<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and mostly useless in a 6LoWPAN network since the fragmentation is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not end-to-end.<br><br>Perhaps add something about "and an NIDS is assumed to have sufficient<br>resources to be able to store and reassemble fragmented packets" and/or<br>"and NIDS are not often deployed within LLNs (as opposed to on an<br>adjacent backbone)" (though I have no hard data to support the latter<br>claim).</div></td>

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br><br>The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. The present document is the second one. This decision had good consensus, and the present document was created and has progressed with no controversy.

The last two were carried out during WGLC, and the comments were addressed in draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-02. Dave Thaler reviewed -04, on behalf of the INTDIR, and subsequent discussion with the authors led to adding normative text to the document and changing its intended status from Informational to Proposed Standard.<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Carles Gomez<br>Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>The shepherd initially reviewed revision -02 of the document. A few suggestions were made and the document was updated in -03 (e.g. using “6LoWPAN” instead of “LLN”, use of the term “minimal” was removed from the text, etc.). Subsequently, a WG participant made questions that led to -04, and the INTDIR review led to revisions -05 and -06. A further shepherd comment led to -07 (on the need to include a reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a>, and a related section). In the shepherd’s opinion, the document is ready for IESG review.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: As mentioned in the response to question (2), Yasuyuki Tanaka, Georgios Papadopoulos and Dominique Barthel carried out comprehensive reviews of the draft. These reviewers have a background in 6TiSCH, where the topic of the document is of interest. <br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: All document authors have confirmed that they are unaware of any IPR that applies to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No IPRs found.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: as mentioned in the response to question (2), the consensus behind this document is solid, with the WG as a whole understanding and agreeing with it.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: There is one "error" (the VRB informational draft, which is normative for this document) and one comment indicated by the idnits tool. The relevant details from the idnits tool output follow: <br><br>&nbsp; -- Found something which looks like a code comment -- if you have code<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  sections in the document, please surround them with '<code>' and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  '<code>' lines.<br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational draft:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly/">draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly</a> (ref.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No: the two normative references that are not yet published as RFCs (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly/01/">draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly-01</a> and draft-ietf-6lo-fragment-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recovery-07) are ready for advancement.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: Yes, <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly/01/">draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly-01</a> is an informational document that is included in this document as a normative reference.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.

Rather, it provides an overview of the benefits and limitations of two approaches for fragment forwarding in 6LoWPAN multihop networks.&nbsp; <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document gives an overview of LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding.<br>&nbsp;  When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be<br>&nbsp;  beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in<br>&nbsp;  its entirety before forwarding it. This has always been possible<br>&nbsp;  with the original fragmentation design of <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC4944</a>. This document is<br>&nbsp;  a companion document to [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly/">I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly</a>],<br>&nbsp;  which details the virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) implementation<br>&nbsp;  technique which reduces the latency and increases end-to-end<br>&nbsp;  reliability in route-over forwarding.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br><br>The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. The present document is the second one. This decision had good consensus, and the present document was created and has progressed with no controversy.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>The document does not actually specify a protocol. Rather, it provides an overview of the benefits and limitations of two approaches for fragment forwarding in 6LoWPAN multihop networks.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Yasuyuki Tanaka, Georgios Papadopoulos and Dominique Barthel carried out deep reviews. The last two were carried out during WGLC, and the comments were addressed in draft-ietf-6lo-minimal-fragment-02.<br><br> If&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: N/A<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd: Carles Gomez<br>Responsible Area Director: Suresh Krishnan<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>The shepherd reviewed revision -02 of the document. A few suggestions were made and the document was updated in -03 (e.g. using “6LoWPAN” instead of “LLN”, use of the term “minimal” was removed from the text, etc.). Subsequently, a WG participant made questions that led to -04. In the shepherd’s opinion, the document is ready for IESG review.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: As mentioned in the response to question (2), Yasuyuki Tanaka, Georgios Papadopoulos and Dominique Barthel performed comprehensive reviews of recent versions of the draft. These reviewers have a background in 6TiSCH, where the topic of the document is of interest.<br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: All document authors have confirmed that they are unaware of any IPR that applies to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No IPRs found.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: as mentioned in the response to question (2), the consensus behind this document is solid, with the WG as a whole understanding and agreeing with it.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document gives an overview of LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding.<br>&nbsp;  When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be<br>&nbsp;  beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in<br>&nbsp;  its entirety before forwarding it. This has always been possible<br>&nbsp;  with the original fragmentation design of <a href="/doc/rfc4944/">RFC4944</a>. This document is<br>&nbsp;  a companion document to [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly/">I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly</a>],<br>&nbsp;  which details the virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) implementation<br>&nbsp;  technique which reduces the latency and increases end-to-end<br>&nbsp;  reliability in route-over forwarding.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>SHEPHERD RESPONSE: <br><br>The topic of fragmentation attracted increased interest from participants at the 6lo working group in 2016-2017, with dedicated fragmentation discussion slots in 6lo at IETF 98 and IETF 99. As a result, a fragmentation Design Team was formed. It was decided that two 6lo wg documents and one lwig wg document would be created, more specifically: a) a document defining a fragment recovery protocol (i.e. the document that is the object of this writeup), b) an informational document giving an overview of minimal fragment forwarding, and c) a document describing the implementation technique that avoids per-hop packet fragmentation and reassembly. The present document is the second one.

A few suggestions were made and the document was updated in -03 (e.g. using “6LoWPAN” instead of “LLN”, use of the term “minimal” was removed from the text, etc.).

If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).
