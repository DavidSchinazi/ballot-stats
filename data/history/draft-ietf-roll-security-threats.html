That<br>probably needs to be noted somewhere, and maybe have a<br>recommendation that LLN nodes ought to react if they see<br>many many errors in any cryptographic operation.&nbsp; That<br>does however need to be balanced against the potential<br>for DoS that might be created should a bad actor send<br>many packets spoofing the source address of a victim node<br>- we don't want the attacker in that case to be able to<br>take the victim node off the network. Its just a hard<br>problem, but one that this document probably ought<br>bring to the attention of RPL implementers who care<br>about security.<br><br>and some specifics....<br><br>- 3.2: Non-repudiation is so the wrong term, but don't<br>feel bad - that's true for almost all uses of the term;-)<br>I think you ought get rid of that term entirely and maybe<br>talk about evidence preservation or something (before you<br>say its not much use in an LLN because of storage<br>constraints:-)<br><br>- 3.2: Same topic. I don't think its correct to say that<br>you can't do logging. It is fair to say that you can't do<br>comprehensive or complete logging, but I'd bet almost all<br>devices that can do RPL could keep a medium sized<br>circular log at least and many could (e.g. via SD card)<br>actually keep quite extensive logs, which in my<br>experience compress excellently. I do agree that log<br>retrieval via the LLN is not so likely so if a device<br>will never be visited or hasn't any other interface but<br>the LLN, then it might not be worth logging, but you<br>don't say that. Even if you need to get the log via a<br>serial connection or JTAG its still very valuable in my<br>experience if you need to investigate some<br>(mis)behaviour. So overall, I'd suggest you don't write<br>off logging as much as you currently do.<br><br>- 3.4: I'm not sure what "misappropriated" is meant to<br>mean. Please clarify. I interpreted it as "leaked out"<br>btw.<br><br>- 3.4: I don't think "legitimacy" is a useful term here<br>and authenticity applies to messages more than<br>participants<br><br>- 3.4: "faithfully" means what? <br><br>- 3.4: I was surprised you didn't say that battery<br>depletion attacks are a potential issue for LBRs in the<br>last set of bullets here.<br><br>- 4.1.1: sniffing is an odd phrase here, maybe better to<br>say eavesdropping<br><br>- 4.2.1: you say attacks can affect convergence of the<br>routing protocol - that might be worth elaborating on as<br>its not clear to this (security geek) reader whether<br>slow/no-convergence is really an attack or (just) an<br>example of ineffecient routing. If you consider the more<br>important audience for this draft to be routing folk, then<br>maybe its ok and they know already. But to put it another<br>way, I'm not sure that causing convergence to be slower <br>by a number of seconds is so much of a threat except<br>in a tiny proportion of LLNs.<br><br>- 4.3.1: There's a gap between the text and the bullet<br>list, its not clear that or how "HELLO flood attacks and<br>ACK spoofing" with RPL can lead to the threat described.<br>I don't doubt you're right, but the text doesn't explain<br>it in a way I can get.<br><br>- 4.3.3: Couldn't the routing protocol offer resilience<br>features that act to help mitigate DoS attacks at other<br>(lower or higher) layers? I don't see why not in principle<br>but you appear to dismiss this.<br><br>- 5.2.2: I don't get how comparison with historical data<br>helps in practice, but I guess it could. Might be useful<br>if there are some papers that could be referenced to help<br>the reader figure out if they could use this kind of<br>approach.<br><br>- 5.3.1: I don't think "coerce" is right, maybe<br>"convince" is better.<br><br>- 5.3.1: Do ACKs really reduce the probability of attack<br>success or rather reduce the impact? Seems more like the<br>latter to me.<br><br>- 5.3.4: Wouldn't limiting the capability of nodes to<br>accept assertions about link or path quality be a <br>counter to sinkhole attacks? That might be something to<br>consider at protocol design time, but might also be<br>something to consider when deploying, e.g. to disallow<br>any peer from claiming to be an awful lot better than<br>all other peers?<br><br>- 5.3.5: It would have been great to see if there is any<br>evidence as to the reality of wormhole attacks. I do<br>sometimes wonder if these are more theoretical than<br>practical (in terms of offering a real advantage to an<br>adversary).<br><br>- 6.1: s/improve vulnerability/reduce vulnerability/<br><br>- 6.1: It might be worth saying that one needs to be<br>careful in deriving new confidentiality keys from<br>new integrity keys. <br><br>- 6.2: Just to make life more difficult, sorry;-) Logging<br>of integrity check failures, if done at the wrong place<br>could actually make a timing side-channel attack more<br>feasible.<br><br>- 6.4: I don't agree that key managment is not directly<br>a ROLL security requirement. If you need some crypto<br>then its a requirement, full stop. The question that<br>arises is whether (and if so how) to meet that requirement<br>for RPL, or since we are where we are, for specific<br>RPL applicabililty statements.<br><br>- 6.5: When you say that conforming to the system's<br>target level of security is a MUST, I think you're mixing<br>up what's mandatory to implement vs. mandatory to use.<br>Some security mechanisms might well (and are often) MTI<br>even though there are deployments where they do not need<br>to be used (at present). And yes, that does lead to<br>sometimes unused code paths, which is a pain. But being<br>able to turn that on without e.g. updating firmware might<br>still be the right answer. (And requiring a secured<br>firmware update is probably more onerous anyway, though<br>should also be done.)</div></td>

Clearly authorization and authentication need to be added in to s3.2 -no?&nbsp; Any chance of just changing to the 5 (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, access control, and non-repudiation) listed in ISO 7498-2?&nbsp; You ever get a stable international reference.&nbsp; You don't need to have that awkward lead-in about non-repudiation in s3.2. and you'd only need to add one availability?&nbsp; If you're going to stick with CIA then please add authorization and authentication in s3.2.<br><br>2) s3: After reading the first paragraph in s3 and comparing it to the output of the IAB workshop (<a href="/doc/rfc1636/">RFC1636</a>) I'm left wondering if it's doing the same thing.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc1636/">RFC 1636</a> says:<br><br>&nbsp; Securing the routing protocols seems to be a straightforward<br>&nbsp; engineering task.&nbsp; The workshop concluded the following.<br><br>&nbsp;  a)&nbsp;  All routing information exchanges should be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authenticated between neighboring routers.<br><br>&nbsp;  b)&nbsp;  The sources of all route information should be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authenticated.<br><br>&nbsp;  c)&nbsp;  Although authenticating the authority of an injector of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; route information is feasible, authentication of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operations on that routing information (e.g.,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; aggregation) requires further consideration.<br><br>S3 closes with:<br><br>&nbsp; In the case of routing security the focus is directed<br>&nbsp; towards the elements associated with the establishment and<br>&nbsp; maintenance of network connectivity.<br><br>The word focus kind of threw me and later in s3.4 you list the fundamental functions of a routing protocol.&nbsp; Is the threats or the things you're trying to secure.&nbsp; And, as Steve pointed out in the secdir review most think of routing security is ensuring the proper functioning of the routing protocol.&nbsp; And, you say you're using definitions from <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a> but the one for "security".<br><br>Later in the paragraph you have "authentication, and potentially integrity, and confidentiality" kind of hangs there after authorization.&nbsp; Authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of what?&nbsp; Also if you're going to do authentication I guess you might not need integrity, but I'd sure like to know how that happens.<br><br>Maybe some tweaks could solve all this: <br><br>Routing security, in essence, is about ensuring the routing protocol operates correctly [insert reference if there is one].&nbsp; It entails measures to ensure ...<br><br>and then (injectors was the IAB's word and maybe we can come up with a better one - or we define a new term in the definitions section)<br><br>State changes would thereby involve not only authorization of injector's actions, authentication of injectors, authentication, integrity, and potentially confidentiality of routing data, but also proper order of state changes through timeliness, since seriously delayed state changes, such as commands or updates of routing tables, may negatively impact system operation.<br><br>3) s3/3.1: in s3 you say:<br><br> A security assessment can<br> therefore begin with a focus on the assets or elements of information<br> that may be the target of the state changes and the access points in...<br><br>and in s3.1 you say:<br><br> An asset implies an important system component (including<br> information, process, or physical resource),<br><br>But asset is also defined in <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a> as:<br><br>&nbsp; $ asset<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (I) A system resource that is (a) required to be protected by an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; information system's security policy, (b) intended to be protected<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a system's mission.<br><br>resource is better than component in my mind (see definition in <a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC 4949</a>) so how about the following in s3:<br><br> A security assessment can<br> therefore begin with a focus on the assets [<a href="/doc/rfc4949/">RFC4949</a>]<br> that may be the target of the state changes and the access points in…<br><br>and in s3.1:<br><br> An asset is an important system resource (including<br> information, process, or physical resource),<br><br>4) Please provide a pointer to the concept of "control plane".&nbsp; Would <a href="/doc/rfc6192/">RFC 6192</a> do as a pointer or maybe add definitions in the definitions section:<br><br>control plane: Supports routing and management functions.<br><br>forward plane: Responsible for receiving a packet on an incoming interface, performing a lookup to identify the packet's next hop and determine the best outgoing interface towards the destination, and forwarding the packet out through the appropriate outgoing interface.<br><br>Also, are we just talking about control plane security here?&nbsp; If that's true can we say way, way sooner - like in the abstract/introduction?<br><br>abstract: <br>&nbsp; A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security<br>&nbsp; threats for the control plane.<br><br>and then else where as appropriate<br><br>5) s3.1: r/components and mechanisms/assets, points of access, and process<br><br>6) s3.1: It's worth reiterating that the Figure is just about the control plane:<br><br>&nbsp; All of this is done on the control plane. (assuming it is)<br><br>7) s3.1: The "route generation" process is missing from the Asset/PoA lists shouldn't it be there?.&nbsp; Also there's a database but it's not listed is that part of "memory"?&nbsp; Isn't "node" without a qualifier missing too?<br><br>8) s3.2: I thought this was about the control plane?&nbsp; Why does the availability paragraph talk about forwarding "services"?<br><br>9) s3.2: The last paragraph has to be more tightly coupled to ROLL.&nbsp; I'm afraid of a food fight between the various routing security groups that are doing work in this space because they're not all implementing enforcement mechanisms for the services described in s3.2.<br><br>10) s3.3: Please add sleepy node to the definitions section: maybe:<br><br>&nbsp; sleepy node: A node that is not functional, but immediately available.<br><br>11) s3.3: What does this mean and why:<br><br>&nbsp; In addition, the choices of security mechanisms are more stringent.<br><br>12) s3.3: Highly directional traffic: Are you trying to say that the LBRs are higher valued targets and warrant something different than the regular nodes?<br><br>13) s3.4: misappropriated seems like the wrong word based on later sections.&nbsp; Masquerade seems like what you're trying to protect against, but that's covered by the peer authentication process.<br><br>14) s3.4: How about:<br><br>In conjunction, it is necessary to be assured of<br><br> o&nbsp; the authenticity and legitimacy of the participants of the routing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; neighbor discovery process;<br><br>NEW:<br><br>In conjunction, it is necessary to be assured that<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; authorized peers authenticate themselves during the routing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; neighbor discovery process;<br><br>15) s3.4: I think you could drop eavesdropping and just say unauthorized exposure<br><br>16) s4: We need to either define the threat sources or point to <a href="/doc/rfc4953/">RFC 4953</a>.&nbsp; There's really only two outsiders and byzantine.<br><br>17) s4.1.1: r/sniffing (passive/passive wiretapping (reading<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r/(evaluation/(e.g., evaluation<br><br>18) 4.2.2: identity misappropriation is really about peer authentication and masquerading<br><br>19) s4.3.2: nice ascii art<br><br>20) s5.1.1: encryption does not counter deliberate exposure attacks.<br><br>21) s5.1.2: Passive wiretapping (“sniffing” to the authors) does not include device compromise.<br><br>22) s5.1.3: TA is always a passive attack, so the description here “… may be passive…” is wrong.&nbsp; Just strike may be passive.<br><br>23) s5.2.3: r/liveliness/liveness<br><br>24) s5.3.2: r/ energy store quicker/ energy store more quickly<br><br>25) s6: difficult to parse: The assessments and analysis in Section 4 examined all areas of threats and attacks that could impact routing, and the countermeasures presented in Section 5 were reached without confining the consideration to means only available to routing.<br><br>26) s6.1: r/and improve vulnerability against other more direct attacks/and reduce vulnerabilities relative to other attacks<br><br>27) s6.2: Can't do security but can keep logs ;)<br><br>28) s6.4: r/Security Key Management/Key Management<br><br>29) s6.5.1: r/diversified needs/diverse needs<br><br>30) I have to admit that I fully expect a consideration about sleep nodes' friend grumpy node.&nbsp; He's likely to cause all the problems.</div></td>

I particularly liked the fact that you treated byzantine attacks and key management as a part of the analysis.<br><br>A couple of small comments, however:<br><br>Section 6.5.1 (Architecture) misses a few aspects on the comparison lower layer vs. routing protocol layer security. Everything that you say about it is correct, but one thing you do not talk about are the problems of providing the exact security services to upper layers that they need. Some of the typical issues include the need to access security information at the routing layer that may be unaware of the exact security parameters, peer identifiers, and other aspects that happened at a lower layer. Similarly, some applications may need security policies that are not easily expressed in crude lower-layer policy models (such as packet filter patterns). A lower-layer mechanism may be run hop-by-hop, whereas the routing layer mechanism may be end-to-end or even secure data objects rather than packets.<br><br>The document also touches very little on deployment aspects of the potential security models. In my view, those are often the hardest to solve in a satisfactory manner. I liked the few words that Section 6.4 said about credential configuration, however.</div></td>

Recent examples can be<br>found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Summary:<br><br><br>&nbsp;  In recent times, networked electronic devices have found an<br>&nbsp;  increasing number of applications in various fields.&nbsp; Yet, for<br>&nbsp;  reasons ranging from operational application to economics, these<br>&nbsp;  wired and wireless devices are often supplied with minimum physical<br>&nbsp;  resources; the constraints include those on computational resources<br>&nbsp;  (RAM, clock speed, storage), communication resources (duty cycle,<br>&nbsp;  packet size, etc.), but also form factors that may rule out user<br>&nbsp;  access interface (e.g., the housing of a small stick-on switch), or<br>&nbsp;  simply safety considerations (e.g., with gas meters).&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  consequence, the resulting networks are more prone to loss of traffic<br>&nbsp;  and other vulnerabilities.&nbsp; The proliferation of these low power and<br>&nbsp;  lossy networks (LLNs), however, are drawing efforts to examine and<br>&nbsp;  address their potential networking challenges.&nbsp; Securing the<br>&nbsp;  establishment and maintenance of network connectivity among these<br>&nbsp;  deployed devices becomes one of these key challenges.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document presents a framework for securing Routing Over LLNs<br>&nbsp;  (ROLL) through an analysis that starts from the routing basics.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  objective is two-fold.&nbsp; First, the framework will be used to identify<br>&nbsp;  pertinent security issues.&nbsp; Second, it will facilitate both the<br>&nbsp;  assessment of a protocol's security threats and the identification of<br>&nbsp;  the necessary features for development of secure protocols for the<br>&nbsp;  ROLL Working Group.<br><br>&nbsp;  The approach adopted in this effort proceeds in four steps, to<br>&nbsp;  examine security issues in ROLL, to analyze threats and attacks, to<br>&nbsp;  consider the countermeasures, and then to make recommendations for<br>&nbsp;  securing ROLL.&nbsp; The basis is found on identifying the assets and<br>&nbsp;  points of access of routing and evaluating their security needs based<br>&nbsp;  on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model in<br>&nbsp;  the context of LLN.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  Security, in essence, entails implementing measures to ensure<br>&nbsp;  controlled state changes on devices and network elements, both based<br>&nbsp;  on external inputs (received via communications) or internal inputs<br>&nbsp;  (physical security of device itself and parameters maintained by the<br>&nbsp;  device, including, e.g., clock).&nbsp; State changes would thereby involve<br>&nbsp;  proper authorization for actions, authentication, and potentially<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality, but also proper order of state changes through<br>&nbsp;  timeliness (since seriously delayed state changes, such as commands<br>&nbsp;  or updates of routing tables, may negatively impact system<br>&nbsp;  operation).&nbsp; A security assessment can therefore begin with a focus<br>&nbsp;  on the assets or elements of information that may be the target of<br>&nbsp;  the state changes and the access points in terms of interfaces and<br>&nbsp;  protocol exchanges through which such changes may occur.&nbsp; In the case<br>&nbsp;  of routing security the focus is directed towards the elements<br>&nbsp;  associated with the establishment and maintenance of network<br>&nbsp;  connectivity.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>No discontent.

Section 7 was removed:<br>this is the result of discussion with the IESG on where and how security issues will be addressed.<br><br>The goal of this new document is to outline threats with the expectation that applicability statements<br>will have to cover (i.e. mitigate or solve) these threats in some way.&nbsp; Please read this document and<br>ask if the questions it asks are clear enough.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The Document Shepherd is JP Vasseur (ROLL co-chair) and the responsible Area<br>Director is Adrian Farrel (AD Routing Area)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>Document Shepherd.

Number of comments have been made on the mailing list during two<br>WG Last Calls and have all been addressed in this revision. Note that several<br>tickets have been opened and have been successfully closed.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No need for broader review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with<br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware<br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the<br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br>if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No particular concern. Some questions were raised has to whether using a<br>pro-active protocol in a "reactive" way was scalable; thus the choice to advance<br>the document along the experimental track.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>already been filed.

No Errors.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such<br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>References split has been done.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references<br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The only normative references are to RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these<br>downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?<br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and<br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and<br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the<br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm<br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the<br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA<br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA<br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the<br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The IANA action is properly documented.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The IANA section specifies no new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to<br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML<br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>No other automated checks performed.<br></div></td>
