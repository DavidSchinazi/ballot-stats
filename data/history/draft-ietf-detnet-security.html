in that context it is better to say<br>that the diffserv security considerations are a subset of the detnet<br>security considerations, as opposed to the current "necessary but not<br>sufficient" phrasing.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In DetNet, there are similar<br>&nbsp;  consequences to DiffServ for lack of detection of, or incorrect<br>&nbsp;

No response needed; I'm just recording<br>that we agreed to disagree.]<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Internal vs. external: internal attackers either have access to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trusted segment of the network or possess the encryption or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authentication keys.&nbsp; External attackers, on the other hand, do<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not have the keys and have access only to the encrypted or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authenticated traffic.<br><br>I think it is common to use "external" to refer to attackers that are<br>entirely outside of a domain and are limited to attmping to send packets<br>into the domain, with no visibility into legitimate traffic inside the<br>domain.&nbsp; The description here suggests that the boundary between<br>"internal" and 'external" is more of a logical one, perhaps relating to<br>access to physical packets (in encrypted form) vs unprotected packts (as<br>available to internal systems), but perhaps there is intended to also be<br>a "secure network" where the physical packets contain the logical data<br>but are physically inaccessible to the attacker.&nbsp; Section 5.3 alludes to<br>the existence of some "security mechanism" that provides the boundary<br>between external and internal attackers, but leaves the actual nature of<br>the boundary unclear, for me.<br>[This looks like it's basically the same as Roman's first discuss point,<br>which I support.]<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; On-path vs. off-path: on-path attackers are located in a position<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that allows interception and modification of in-flight protocol<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets, whereas off-path attackers can only attack by generating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; protocol packets.<br><br>We sometimes differentiate between (e.g.) "active" or "passive" on-path<br>attackers, where interception/viewing is done in either form but<br>modification only done in the "active" form.<br><br>Section 5.2.3<br><br>I don't understand why the section title includes "Resource<br>Segmentation"; the scenario being described seems to discuss risks that<br>are present when resources are *not* properly segmented.&nbsp; Resource<br>Segmentation by itself should not be a threat in this regard.<br><br>&nbsp;  An attacker can inject traffic that will consume network resources<br>&nbsp;  such that it affects DetNet flows.&nbsp; This can be performed using non-<br>&nbsp;  DetNet traffic that indirectly affects DetNet traffic (hardware<br>&nbsp;  resource exhaustion), or by using DetNet traffic from one DetNet flow<br>&nbsp;  that directly affects traffic from different DetNet flows.<br><br>I don't understand what is meant by "detnet traffic from one flow that<br>directly affects traffic from different detnet flows".&nbsp; How might this<br>happen?<br><br>Section 5.2.4.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bridge, the flow is hijacked by the attacker.&nbsp; It is now posible<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to either replace en route packets with malicious packets, or<br>&nbsp;

 A passive eavesdropper can identify DetNet flows and then gather<br>&nbsp;  information about en route DetNet flows, e.g., the number of DetNet<br>&nbsp;  flows, their bandwidths, their schedules, or other temporal<br>&nbsp;  properties.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I suggest "other temporal or statistical properties" to encompass things<br>like latency and jitter, which are only in some limited sense temporal<br>properties.<br><br>&nbsp;  DetNet flows are typically uniquely identified by their 6-tuple, i.e.<br>&nbsp;  fields within the IP header, however in some implementations the flow<br>&nbsp;  ID may also be augmented by additional per-flow attributes known to<br>&nbsp;  the system, e.g. above the IP-layer.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>pedantically, the ports in the 6-tuple are also above the IP layer.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  For the purpose of this<br>&nbsp;  document we assume any such additional fields used for flow ID are<br>&nbsp;  encrypted and/or integrity-protected from external attackers.<br><br>I suggest adding a note that existing OT protocols designed for use on<br>dedicated secure networks may not intrinsically provide such protection,<br>in which case IPsec or transport layer security mechanisms may be<br>needed.&nbsp;

 Any compute time which is required for encryption and decryption<br>&nbsp;  processing ('crypto') must be included in the flow latency<br>&nbsp;  calculations.&nbsp; Thus, crypto algorithms used in a DetNet must have<br>&nbsp;

The most simple example I would have is a router with a malfunction rewriting the destination address or flow label of a packet causing the packet to change the flow it is belonging too, thus if occurring for any significant amount of packets causing overflow in the next hop router when the original and the remarked flow compete for the same resources assigned. The only way to ensure that this happens is to verify a strong header integrity protection at each point a decision on how to forward, classify or remark the flow is done. So Section 3.3 indicate that this is an issue, but only discusses how it can be solved over ethernet. This issue hasn't been well handled in either the MPLS or IP detnet data planes as no additional mechanism was required to ensure this criteria is meet. <br><br>So I think the requirement that also malfunctions in equipment don't result in flow violations is hard, and will require that the already approved data plane specification needs additional mechanism that verify all data used on each occasion the data is used. Neither MPLS nor IP as currently specified fulfill this, not even against non-malicious malfunctions or corruption type malfunctions. Then we have those malfunction that breaks the network or where control plane information provided is being corrupted. <br><br>I have only looked a bit deeply on one type of malfunction that I know that can occur. I convinced that this document will indicate a number of additional potential ways things can go wrong that can't be determined without additional mechanisms and likely additional per packet fields. Thus, I think we need to discuss if the security properties matches the actual approved data plane, or if the property is so important that the data plane specification is moved back to the WG to be fixed? <br><br>I would also recommend that you don't indicate that a different manufacturer can be blamed. Isn't a malfunction going to occur where they occur, it is not like a single vendor network will be without malfunctions due to hardware issue, nor have its set of software bugs. <br><br>Section 9.1:<br><br><br>&nbsp;  The IP protocol has a long history of security considerations and<br>&nbsp;  architectural protection mechanisms.&nbsp; From a data plane perspective<br>&nbsp;  DetNet does not add or modify any IP header information, so the<br>&nbsp;  carriage of DetNet traffic over an IP data plane does not introduce<br>&nbsp;  any new security issues that were not there before, apart from those<br>&nbsp;  already described in the data-plane-independent threats section<br>&nbsp;  Section 5, Security Threats.<br><br>The above requirement from Section 3.1 in regards to IP header fields used for flow classification are not automatically fulfilled without additional mechanisms. Thus, I would claim that DETNET unless Section 3.1 requirement is minimized will require support for a strong integrity mechanism over all headers. So if this needs to be keyed or not is totally dependent on if malicious modifications of packet headers needs to be taken into account or not. <br><br>Section 9.2: <br><br>Same as previous issue but for integrity over the MPLS headers.</div></td>
