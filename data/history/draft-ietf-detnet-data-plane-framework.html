I've tried to deduplicate with what was<br>already reported by other ADs, but no doubt have kept a few things in that<br>have already been mentioned.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The DetNet Architecture models the DetNet related data plane<br>&nbsp;  functions decomposed into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a<br>&nbsp;  forwarding sub-layer.&nbsp; The service sub-layer is used to provide<br><br>nit: "models" needs two objects to act on/compare, so maybe "as being<br>decomposed into".<br><br>&nbsp;  replicated in other forwarding technologies.&nbsp; Most of DetNet benefits<br>&nbsp;  can be gained by running over a data link layer that has not been<br>&nbsp;  specifically enhanced to support all TSN capabilities but for certain<br>&nbsp;  networks and traffic mixes delay and jitter performance may vary due<br>&nbsp;  to the forwarding sub-layer intrinsic properties.<br><br>nit: I think the "certain networks and traffic mixes" are supposed to be<br>contingent on "a data link layer that [is not a TSN]" but the current text<br>does not quite match that.&nbsp; Perhaps "certain such networks" is the smallest<br>fix, though it does conflate "data link layer" and "network" in an<br>unfortunate manner.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  connectivity function of the forwarding sub-layer.&nbsp; An example of<br>&nbsp;  this is Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering functions see<br>&nbsp;  Section 4.3.&nbsp; The ordering (POF) uses sequence numbers added to<br><br>nit: the punctuation around the reference should be tweaked.<br><br>&nbsp;  The method of instantiating each of the layers is specific to the<br>&nbsp;  particular DetNet data plane method, and more than one approach may<br>&nbsp;  be applicable to a given bearer network type.<br><br>What is a "bearer network"?<br><br>Section 3.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  applying existing standardized headers and/or encapsulations.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  Detnet forwarding sub-layer may provide capabilities leveraging that<br>&nbsp;  same header or encapsulation technology (e.g., DN IP or DN MPLS) or<br>&nbsp;  it may be achieved by other technologies (e.g., Figure 2).&nbsp; DetNet is<br><br>nit: Figure 2 is not a technology; maybe "as shown in Figure 2".<br><br>Section 3.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  number) in packets.&nbsp; For example, in DetNet IP, zero encapsulation is<br>&nbsp;  used and no sequence number is available, and in DetNet MPLS, DetNet<br>&nbsp;  specific information may be added explicitly to the packets in the<br>&nbsp;  format of S-label and d-CW [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-mpls/">I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls</a>] .<br><br>nit: s/format of/form of/<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Number (for PREOF) for each DetNet flow.&nbsp; The DetNet Service sub-<br>&nbsp;  layer requires both; the DetNet forwarding sub-layer requires only<br>&nbsp;  Flow-ID.&nbsp; Metadata can also be used for OAM indications and<br><br>nit(?): to say that "the service sublayer requires both" to me implies that<br>it always and unconditionally requires both, but IIUC the PREOF functions<br>are optional, and so for a given flow the service sublayer might not require<br>the sequence number.&nbsp; Perhaps swapping it around to be structured more like<br>"the flow-ID is used by both the service and forwarding sub-layers, but the<br>sequence number is only used by the service layer" would help?<br><br>&nbsp;  Some MPLS examples of implicit metadata include the sequence number<br>&nbsp;  for use by the PREOF function, or even all the essential information<br>&nbsp;  being included into the DetNet over MPLS label stack (the DetNet<br>&nbsp;  Control Word and the DetNet Service label).<br><br>I would have thought that the detnet elements in the label stack would be<br>considered explicit metadata, but perhaps I'm just looking through the wrong<br>lens.<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp;  One method of operating an IP DetNet data plane without encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  is to use "6-tuple" based flow identification, where "6-tuple" refers<br>&nbsp;  to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol headers.<br>&nbsp;  General background on the use of IP headers, and "6-tuples", to<br>&nbsp;  identify flows and support Quality of Service (QoS) can be found in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc3670/">RFC3670</a>].&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc7657/">RFC7657</a>] provides useful background on differentiated<br><br>I did not see the explicit phrase "6-tuple" used in <a href="/doc/rfc3670/">RFC 3670</a>, so I don't<br>think this text is quite right as written.&nbsp; (7657 does talk about it, but is<br>not currently being referenced for that purpose.)<br><br>Section 3.6.1.5<br><br>Is there a difference between "packet-by-packet distribution [of the same<br>flow]" and "packet-by-packet load sharing"?<br><br>Section 3.6.1.6<br><br>&nbsp;  as those in use by IP and MPLS networks.&nbsp; At the Application layer a<br>&nbsp;  client of a DetNet service can use existing techniques to detect and<br>&nbsp;  monitor delay and loss.<br><br>[Is there a good reference for these "existing techniques"?&nbsp; I recognize<br>that we shouldn't go into extensive detail here, and absent a single<br>consolidated reference, no-reference may be best.]<br><br>Section 3.6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Service protection allow DetNet services to increase reliability and<br>&nbsp;  maintain a DetNet Service Assurance in the case of network congestion<br>&nbsp;  or network failure.&nbsp; Detnet relies on the underlying technology<br><br>My understanding is that the whole point of DetNet was to provide<br>reliability in the face of network congestion (e.g., by resource<br>reservation).&nbsp; So is it really only the "network failure" case that benefits<br>from service protection?<br><br>Section 3.6.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  IP aggregation has both data plane and controller plane aspects.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  the data plane, flows may be aggregated for treatment based on shared<br>&nbsp;  characteristics such as 6-tuple.&nbsp; Alternatively, an IP encapsulation<br><br>In what way would 6-tuple be a "shared characteristic" for *different*<br>flows?&nbsp; I thought 6-tuple was typically used as a unique flow identifier...<br>(I see in Section 4.2.1 we refer to flows that "share 6-tuple attributes".)<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, they are not<br>&nbsp;  equivalent at all.&nbsp; Some approaches are more scalable than others in<br>&nbsp;  terms of signaling load on the network.&nbsp; Some can take advantage of<br>&nbsp;  global tracking of resources in the DetNet domain for better overall<br>&nbsp;  network resource optimization.&nbsp; Some are more resilient than others<br>&nbsp;  if link, node, or management equipment failures occur.&nbsp; While a<br>&nbsp;  detailed analysis of the control plane alternatives is out of the<br>&nbsp;  scope of this document, the requirements from this document can be<br>&nbsp;  used as the basis of a later analysis of the alternatives.<br><br>side note: using "some" so much requires the reader to know which are which<br>... that may be reasonable, but perhaps we want the reader's brainpower<br>working on other things.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>nit: RestConf and YANG probably are best considered together as a single<br>"management mechanism" for these purposes.<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  DetNet application with the required service.&nbsp; A requirement for the<br>&nbsp;  DetNet Controller Plane will be the ability to assign a particular<br>&nbsp;  identified DetNet IP flow to a path through the DetNet domain that<br>&nbsp;  has been assigned the required nodal resources.&nbsp; This provides the<br><br>nit: I don't think that "nodal" is quite the right word, here, as it refers<br>to a property of the (network) graph more than the specific element<br>colocated with the node in the graph.&nbsp; "per-node" seems like a better fit,<br>to me.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  domain requires explicit support.&nbsp; There may be capabilities that can<br>&nbsp;  be used, or extended, for example GMPLS end-to-end recovery [<a href="/doc/rfc4872/">RFC4872</a>]<br>&nbsp;  and GMPLS segment recovery [<a href="/doc/rfc4873/">RFC4873</a>].<br><br>nit: maybe this is "existing capabilities"?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>I guess there's some standard security considerations for when flow<br>aggregation is in play, namely that misbehavior from one component flow can<br>affect sibling flows as collateral damage.<br><br>&nbsp;  Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-security/">I-D.ietf-detnet-security</a>].&nbsp; General security considerations are<br><br>The referenced document (now at -09) seems significantly improved from when<br>I previously made an in-passing review of the -03<br>(<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/jZLodXBmQa7ZFDbBIvDO_xCDD0E/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/jZLodXBmQa7ZFDbBIvDO_xCDD0E/</a>),<br>however, some of the issues I mentioned there remain, at least in part<br>(e.g., mentioning the use of HMAC without a colocated discussion of the need<br>for key distribution and having a taxonomy of threats titled "threat<br>model").&nbsp; I would like to know what the current maturity state of the<br>detnet-security document is believed to be, so as to judge how appropriate<br>it is for the data-plane-framework to refer to it in this manner.<br><br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8655/">RFC8655</a>].&nbsp; This section considers general security<br><br>I think this is more like "Architecture-level DetNet" than "Generic", as the<br>current formulation sounds like it should be referring to <a href="/doc/bcp72/">BCP 72</a> :)<br><br>&nbsp;  Security aspects which are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to<br>&nbsp;  provide the specific quality of service aspects of DetNet, which are<br>&nbsp;  primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet loss rates<br>&nbsp;  and bounded end-to-end delivery latency.<br><br>I can't find a way to read this other than "security aspects [...] whose aim<br>is to provide the specific quality of service aspects", and I'm puzzling at<br>why it's phrased in this way.&nbsp; Specifically, I thought that *providing* the<br>QoS aspects is the core role of DetNet, and thus that the *security* aspects<br>would be protecting those aspects in the face of (some class of) attackers.<br>Would it be appropriate to replace this with something like the following?<br><br>% Part of what makes DetNet unique is its ability to provide specific and<br>% reliable quality of service (delivering data flows with extremely low<br>% packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery latency), and the<br>% security-related aspects of protecting that quality of service are<br>% similarly unique.<br><br>This might also be a good place to note that correct operation of the PREOF<br>functions is pretty critical, and failures there could lead to pretty<br>catastrophic situations for the operational technology relying on them.&nbsp; I<br>don't think there are ways for an attacker to try to attack them directly,<br>but Murphy's Law can be a pretty effective attacker, too.<br><br>&nbsp;  The primary considerations for the data plane is to maintain<br>&nbsp;  integrity of data and delivery of the associated DetNet service<br>&nbsp;  traversing the DetNet network.&nbsp; Application flows can be protected<br><br>I'd suggest leading in to this with "As for all communications protocols,"<br>to be clear that this paragraph is not trying to cover the bits that are<br>"unique to DetNet" as much as remind the reader of general best practices.<br><br>&nbsp;  At the management and control level DetNet flows are identified on a<br>&nbsp;  per-flow basis, which may provide controller plane attackers with<br>&nbsp;  additional information about the data flows (when compared to<br>&nbsp;  controller planes that do not include per-flow identification).&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  is an inherent property of DetNet which has security implications<br>&nbsp;  that should be considered when determining if DetNet is a suitable<br>&nbsp;  technology for any given use case.<br><br>I might also note that attackers with access to the controller plan already<br>have pretty significant attacks available to them.<br><br>&nbsp;  To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet service,<br>&nbsp;  provisions can be made against DOS attacks and delay attacks.&nbsp; To<br>&nbsp;  protect against DOS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious or<br>&nbsp;  malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated, for example<br>&nbsp;  through the use of existing mechanism such as policing and shaping<br>&nbsp;  applied at the input of a DetNet domain.&nbsp; To prevent DetNet packets<br><br>In my head this would include things like disabling switch ports that are<br>receiving traffic floods that might overload the switch CPU, in order to<br>protect the DetNet traffic on other ports.&nbsp; I don't see much value in saying<br>that in the document, though, since it's more of an operational practice<br>thing.<br><br>Section 9.1<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc3209/">RFC 3209</a> is cited only once, and it does not seem like a particularly<br>normative one.&nbsp; Similarly, <a href="/doc/rfc3473/">RFC 3473</a> is cited only as a "such as" example<br>(though several times).</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>&gt; examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>&gt; documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Technical Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&gt;&nbsp;  an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  or introduction.<br><br>This document provides an overall framework for the DetNet data plane.&nbsp; It covers concepts and considerations that are generally common to any Deterministic Networking data plane specification.<br><br>&gt; Working Group Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&gt;&nbsp;  example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&gt;&nbsp;  were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&gt;&nbsp;  rough?<br><br>Nothing specific to this Framework draft. <br><br>&gt; Document Quality<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>DetNet is based on well-known IETF protocols (IP, MPLS) which are used without modification. At this time there are no shipping implementations of DetNet per se. <br><br>&gt; Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&gt;&nbsp;  implement the specification? <br><br>Several major vendors have been core to the development of DetNet, including Cisco, Huawei, and Ericsson so it is assumed that they plan to implement it. <br><br>&gt; Are there any reviewers that <br>&gt;&nbsp;  merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&gt;&nbsp;  conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&gt;&nbsp;  there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&gt;&nbsp;  review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>The DetNet WG (including David Black, DetNet Technical Advisor) have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. <br>A dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress the set of data plane drafts. <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>&gt; Personnel<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>&gt; Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&gt; the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>&gt; for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>&gt; the IESG.<br>&gt; <br><br>I have reread this document as it progressed as well as in its final<br>form.&nbsp; All significant comments have been addressed. The document is<br>ready for publication. <br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&gt; breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&gt; broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>&gt; DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>&gt; took place.<br><br>No. As an Informational document, requirements for external review of this Framework draft are less extensive compared with the Normative DetNet Data Plane drafts which will be submitted for publication in conjunction with this draft. <br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>&gt; has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>&gt; IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>&gt; with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>&gt; is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>&gt; has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>&gt; concerns here.<br><br>No concerns.&nbsp; This document is ready to be published.<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&gt; disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>&gt; and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>&gt; represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>&gt; being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Very solid.&nbsp; The document (in the context of the full set of DetNet Data Plane drafts) is mature and has been discussed sufficiently among the broad DetNet WG audience.<br> <br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>&gt; discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate<br>&gt; email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>&gt; separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>&gt; <br><br>No. <br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&gt; document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>&gt; Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>&gt; thorough.<br><br>IDNits passes without errors. <br> <br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>&gt; criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>&gt;<br><br>N/A<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>&gt; either normative or informative?<br>&gt;<br><br>Yes<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&gt; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>N/A. <br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>&gt; If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>&gt; the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>&gt; existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>&gt; in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>&gt; listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>&gt; part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>&gt; other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>&gt; explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>&gt; section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>&gt; document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>&gt; are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>&gt; Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>&gt; identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>&gt; detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>&gt; allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>&gt; reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>N/A, no IANA requests.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>&gt; allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>&gt; useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>&gt; Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>&gt; language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>&gt; <br><br>The only automated review was idnits.</div></td>
