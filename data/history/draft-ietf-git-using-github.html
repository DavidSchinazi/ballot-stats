While I'm on this soapbox, I'd like to thank the authors for listening to, and trying to address my concerns.<br><br>I'm uncomfortable with much of this document:<br>1: This a BCP, and strongly implies that this is the "right" way for working groups to manage themselves and documents streams. The charter says: "Whether working groups choose to use GitHub or the documented policies to support their work will remain entirely at their discretion." - while the document does let WGs choose, the BCP track strongly implies that this is the "best" way. I happen to put documents that I author in git (hosted on GitHub), and use that to collaborate with my co-authors, but this is *our* choice, imposing our working process on others is a mistake - we have used the "as long at it can be turned into the canonical format we don't care how you make it" paradigm for a reason. If people create the XML in vim or emacs is, and should be entirely their decision - telling people that the "right" editor is vi is wrong - and a BCP does that... <br><br>The charter also says: "The documents produced by this group will not alter the Internet Standards Process (<a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP 9</a>). They will describe how to work within it."<br>but the document sails very close to the wind in many places - e.g: "Working Group chairs MAY request a revision of an Internet-Draft being managed on Github at any time, in consultation with document editors." It has always been clear that chairs can request revisions to WG documents; this doesn't change it, but mentioning things like this simply muddies the water / makes more places for people to have to check. Section 7 is an example place where is is really dangerous - and I think comes close to trying to change <a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP9</a>.<br><br>2: The focus on GitHub makes my deeply uncomfortable -- I get the argument that it is the standard / best known hosted git provider (and, in my *opinion* the right one for us to use), but there are many places where term "GitHub" applies to "self hosted" solutions like GitLab / Gitea / etc. This feels very close to the IETF recommending that WG participants sign the blue-sheets with a Bic pen when all we need is some sort of writing implement. Just as one example: "GitHub facilitates more involved interactions,..." this is true of gitea, gitlab, bitbucket and many other tools -- calling out GitHub gives one tool prominence and is not appropriate for the IETF to do.<br><br>3: We require that all decisions be made on mailing lists - when people happen to use GitHub to collaborate on documents and happen to use the issue tracker to track issues, it is clear that this is just for their personal convenience -- having WG "owned" repos *will* lead to instances where decisions get made in the issue tracker, and not communicated tp the mailing list - this will end up with two classes of users: those that keep checking the issue tracker, and those that follow the mailing list and are surprised by the decisions made.<br><br>4: git (and GitHub) has a really steep learning curve - if a WG decides to fully jump in and start using GitHub, this (either explicitly or implicitly) disenfranchises people who don't use or want to use git. <br><br>5: Moving state (primarily issues) from a personal repo to a WG one when a document is adopted is non-trivial -- "You can only transfer issues between repositories owned by the same user or organization account. You can't transfer an issue from a private repository to a public repository." and they have to be (AFAIK), moved individually - this will likely lead to loss of state (I may also have missed it, but I don't see anywhere in the document that talks about migrating a document / repo from an individual to a WG hosted version, and what should happen). I have a document which moved from hosted at <a href="http://www.github.com/wkumari/">www.github.com/wkumari/</a> to <a href="http://www.github.com/capport-wg/">www.github.com/capport-wg/</a> - this involved administrative annoyance, loss of state, and annoyance - for no benefit that I could see. I think a much much better approach would be have people simple keep the documents in their personal repos and not have the disruption that moving the repo entails. <br><br>Don't get me wrong - I like git, and a: host my own gitea instance, b: maintain a few gitlabs and gogs instances, and c: put all of my drafts in GitHub - but I really don't think that the IETF should be implying that this is the "one true way" (BCP) (nor do I like the WG hosted model).</div></td>

While I'm on this soapbox, I'd like to thank the authors for listening to, and trying to address my concerns.<br><br>I'm uncomfortable with much of this document:<br>1: This a BCP, and strongly implies that this is the "right" way for working groups to manage themselves and documents streams. The charter says: "Whether working groups choose to use GitHub or the documented policies to support their work will remain entirely at their discretion." - while the document does let WGs choose, the BCP track strongly implies that this is the "best" way. I happen to put documents that I author in git (hosted on GitHub), and use that to collaborate with my co-authors, but this is *our* choice, imposing our working process on others is a mistake - we have used the "as long at it can be turned into the canonical format we don't care how you make it" paradigm for a reason. If people create the XML in vim or emacs is, and should be entirely their decision - telling people that the "right" editor is vi is wrong - and a BCP does that... <br><br>The charter also says: "The documents produced by this group will not alter the Internet Standards Process (<a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP 9</a>). They will describe how to work within it."<br>but the document sails very close to the wind in many places - e.g: "Working Group chairs MAY request a revision of an Internet-Draft being managed on Github at any time, in consultation with document editors." It has always been clear that chairs can request revisions to WG documents; this doesn't change it, but mentioning things like this simply muddies the water / makes more places for people to have to check. Section 7 is an example place where is is really dangerous - and I think comes close to trying to change <a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP9</a>.<br><br>2: The focus on GitHub makes my deeply uncomfortable -- I get the argument that it is the standard / best known hosted git provider (and, in my *opinion* the right one for us to use), but there are many places where term "GitHub" applies to "self hosted" solutions like GitLab / Gitea / etc. This feels very close to the IETF recommending that WG participants sign the blue-sheets with a Bic pen when all we need is some sort of writing implement. Just as one example: "GitHub facilitates more involved interactions,..." this is true of gitea, gitlab, bitbucket and many other tools -- calling out GitHub gives one tool prominence and is not appropriate for the IETF to do.<br><br>3: We require that all decisions be made on mailing lists - when people happen to use GitHub to collaborate on documents and happen to use the issue tracker to track issues, it is clear that this is just for their personal convenience -- having WG "owned" repos *will* lead to instances where decisions get made in the issue tracker, and not communicated tp the mailing list - this will end up with two classes of users: those that keep checking the issue tracker, and those that follow the mailing list and are surprised by the decisions made.<br><br>4: git (and GitHub) has a really steep learning curve - if a WG decides to fully jump in and start using GitHub, this (either explicitly or implicitly) disenfranchises people who don't use or want to use git. <br><br>5: Moving state (primarily issues) from a personal repo to a WG one when a document is adopted is non-trivial -- "You can only transfer issues between repositories owned by the same user or organization account. You can't transfer an issue from a private repository to a public repository." and they have to be (AFAIK), moved individually - this will likely lead to loss of state (I may also have missed it, but I don't see anywhere in the document that talks about migrating a document / repo from an individual to a WG hosted version, and what should happen). I have a document which moved from hosted at <a href="http://www.github.com/wkumari/">www.github.com/wkumari/</a> to <a href="http://www.github.com/capport-wg/">www.github.com/capport-wg/</a> - this involved administrative annoyance, loss of state, and annoyance - for no benefit that I could see. I think a much much better approach would be have people simple keep the documents in their personal repos and not have the disruption that moving the repo entails. <br><br>Don't get me wrong - I like git, and a: host my own gitea instance, b: maintain a few gitlabs and gogs instances, and c: put all of my drafts in GitHub - but I really don't think that the IETF should be implying that this is the "one true way" (BCP) (nor do I like the WG hosted model).</div></td>

The charter says: "Whether working groups choose to use GitHub or the documented policies to support their work will remain entirely at their discretion." - while the document does let WGs choose, the BCP track strongly implies that this is the "best" way. I happen to put documents that I author in git (hosted on GitHub), and use that to collaborate with my co-authors, but this is *our* choice, imposing our working process on others is a mistake - we have used the "as long at it can be turned into the canonical format we don't care how you make it" paradigm for a reason. If people create the XML in vim or emacs is, and should be entirely their decision - telling people that the "right" editor is vi is wrong - and a BCP does that... <br><br>The charter also says: "The documents produced by this group will not alter the Internet Standards Process (<a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP 9</a>). They will describe how to work within it."<br>but the document sails very close to the wind in many places - e.g: "Working Group chairs MAY request a revision of an Internet-Draft being managed on Github at any time, in consultation with document editors." It has always been clear that chairs can request revisions to WG documents; this doesn't change it, but mentioning things like this simply muddies the water / makes more places for people to have to check. Section 7 is an example place where is is really dangerous - and I think comes close to trying to change <a href="/doc/bcp9/">BCP9</a>.<br><br><br>2: The focus on GitHub makes my deeply uncomfortable -- I get the argument that it is the standard / best known hosted git provider (and, in my *opinion* the right one for us to use), but there are many places where term "GitHub" applies to "self hosted" solutions like GitLab / Gitea / etc. This feels very close to the IETF recommending that WG participants sign the blue-sheets with a Bic pen when all we need is some sort of writing implement. Just as one example: "GitHub facilitates more involved interactions,..." this is true of gitea, gitlab, bitbucket and many other tools -- calling out GitHub gives one tool prominence and is not appropriate for the IETF to do.<br><br>3: We require that all decisions be made on mailing lists - when people happen to use GitHub to collaborate on documents and happen to use the issue tracker to track issues, it is clear that this is just for their personal convenience -- having WG "owned" repos *will* lead to instances where decisions get made in the issue tracker, and not communicated tp the mailing list - this will end up with two classes of users: those that keep checking the issue tracker, and those that follow the mailing list and are surprised by the decisions made.<br><br>4: git (and GitHub) has a really steep learning curve - if a WG decides to fully jump in and start using GitHub, this (either explicitly or implicitly) disenfranchises people who don't use or want to use git. <br><br>5: Moving state (primarily issues) from a personal repo to a WG one when a document is adopted is non-trivial -- "You can only transfer issues between repositories owned by the same user or organization account. You can't transfer an issue from a private repository to a public repository." and they have to be (AFAIK), moved individually - this will likely lead to loss of state (I may also have missed it, but I don't see anywhere in the document that talks about migrating a document / repo from an individual to a WG hosted version, and what should happen). I have a document which moved from hosted at <a href="http://www.github.com/wkumari/">www.github.com/wkumari/</a> to <a href="http://www.github.com/capport-wg/">www.github.com/capport-wg/</a> - this involved administrative annoyance, loss of state, and annoyance - for no benefit that I could see. I think a much much better approach would be have people simple keep the documents in their personal repos and not have the disruption that moving the repo entails. <br><br>Don't get me wrong - I like git, and a: host my own gitea instance, b: maintain a few gitlabs and gogs instances, and c: put all of my drafts in GitHub - but I really don't think that the IETF should be implying that this is the "one true way" (BCP) (nor do I like the WG hosted model).</div></td>

I have a couple of issue below that touch on the use of normative language and relation to <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a> (as well as maybe <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a>). I guess those could qualify as discuss but I leave them as comments for now trusting in the editors and AD to address them appropriately.<br><br>One general comment:<br>I don't really understand the relationship between this document and draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration. There is a lot of direct overlap especially in section 2 but also in other sections. I understand that this document is BCP and such more appropriate to specify practices normatively but I don't really see why <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration/">draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration</a> is still needed then. The only part that is left to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration/">draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration</a> are ideas about how things could be integrated in the datatracker and with the secretariat. As I say in my discuss ballot for that draft, it is not clear to my why we need an RFC for that at this point of time. If no decision is made yet, this could have also just be integrated e.g. into the appendix on this draft (or even partially in the security considerations section).<br><br>Other comments/questions:<br><br>1) Sec 3.2<br>"...or they might create repositories for individual documents on request."<br>I made a similar comment in my ballot for draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration. I think creating repos for individuals document is maybe not always the best option. I assume the intention here to not out-rule any cases where this might be okay (e.g. if a document is expectd to be adopted soon), however, I would rather prefer to see a recommendation to usually not do that as there can be many individual drafts in the groups and it can provide a wrong signal if repos are created for some and not others.<br><br>2) Sec 4.1.3:<br>"&nbsp;  Issues that have reached a resolution that has Working Group<br>&nbsp;  consensus MUST NOT be reopened unless new information is presented."<br>I do understand the intention here as it is important to make process, however, inline with the rest of the document and the general idea that practises can vary from group to group, I think this really should be a SHOULD NOT only.<br><br>Also further<br>"Resolved issues MUST remain<br>&nbsp;  closed unless there is consensus to reopen an issue."<br>I find this actually a bit strange because it should also then say something like "Resolved issues MUST only be closed with wg consensus"... I guess the word "resolved" is important here but why would you re-open an issue at all if it is resolved? I guess the case is that the wg figures that the issue is not resolved yet. Is the recommendation here for a wg participant to open a new issue if he/she thinks an issue is not fully resolved yet (rather than just re-open)? If so, you should say that.<br><br>3) Sec 4.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Editors SHOULD make pull requests for all substantial changes rather<br>&nbsp;  than committing directly to the "master" branch of the repository."<br>I think this does not align well with how we work today (without GitHub). E.g. if a group decides to use GitHub to better track changes and maybe easily integrate editorial comments, but decide to have all discussion on the mailing list (and not use github issues), I think it would be fully okay for the editors just commit directly based on the consensus on the mailing list. So I think the important part is that substantial comments should only be committed with wg consensus and therefore it is a good practice to have pull requests first to declare consensus based on the concrete proposed edits. However, if a different way to declare consensus is used that's fine as well. In short, I think the SHOULD is to string here for the general case.<br><br>4) Sec 5.3 (mostly editorial):<br>"It is possible to use<br>&nbsp;  different processes for different documents in the Working Group.<br><br>&nbsp;  Working Group chairs SHOULD confirm that the Working Group has<br>&nbsp;  consensus to adopt any process.&nbsp; In particular, the introduction of a<br>&nbsp;  more tightly-controlled process can have the effect of privileging<br>&nbsp;  positions already captured in documents, which might disadvantage<br>&nbsp;  alternative viewpoints."<br>This text seems to apply more general to all content in section 5 and should maybe be moved out of section 5.3. Similarly I'm not sure if section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 should actually be subsection of 5.3. The question of which issue to track seem rather orthogonal to the question who resolves the issue (I agree that this discussion does not make sense when no issue are tracked like in sec 5.1 but it could make sense for the mode in section 5.2)<br><br>5) Sec 5.3.1:<br>"The risk is that<br>&nbsp;  design changes might not always reflect the consensus of the Working<br>&nbsp;  Group."<br>I know that happens, even without GitHub, but should ideally not be the case. However, I think the root cause is rather that changes were incorrectly not identified by the editors as requiring consensus. Maybe this can be reworded accordingly to not give the impression that it is okay to implement design changes in a working group without consensus. Actually this is a broader problem (independent of GitHub) because some editors, especially when they also have been the authors of the individual draft, often implement design changes first in a new version and then ask the working group for consensus. As I said that's a different issue but it could be good to mention that GitHub and the use of PRs can actually help to not use this practice but always each consensus first.<br><br>6) Sec 5.3.1:<br>"... it is likely appropriate to move<br>&nbsp;  to a more tightly controlled process."<br>Maybe add something like "e.g. potentially during or after after working group last call". I think in many groups (that do not use GitHub) it is very common practice that editors have full control about the document. I mean I guess that's their role. I think GitHub really can help to make the process more transparent but it should not be a requirement. Especially shorter documents that had have good consensus form the beginning, there might necessarily be a need to every change that process. (I would say QUIC is rather the other extreme.)<br><br>7) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Chairs might choose to manage the process of deciding which issues<br>&nbsp;  are substantive.&nbsp; For instance, chairs might reserve the ability to<br>&nbsp;  use the "design" label to new issues (see Section 5.4.1) and to close<br>&nbsp;  issues marked as "design".&nbsp; Chairs should always allow document<br>&nbsp;  editors to identify and address editorial issues as they see fit."<br>I guess you could also use normative language here: "MAY choose to" and "Chairs SHOULD always allow"<br><br>8) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  As documents mature further, explicit confirmation of technical<br>&nbsp;  decisions with the Working Group mailing list becomes more important."<br>Not sure I agree here. I know what you mean but explicit confirmation on the mailing list is always important. Maybe there is a way to rephrase that (or just remove that sentence...?)<br><br>9) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Gaining Working Group consensus about the resolution of issues can be<br>&nbsp;  done in the abstract, with editors being permitted to capture the<br>&nbsp;  outcome of discussions as they see fit."<br>I'm actually not sure what you mean here. Can you clarify?<br><br>10) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  WGLC SHOULD be proposed as pull requests, and MUST be discussed on<br>&nbsp;  the mailing list, and MUST have chairs explicitly confirm consensus."<br>I agree with the "MUST be discussed on the mailing list" (as this is inline with <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a> e.g. 3.2 but therefore doesn't necessarily need to be normative in this doc) but find the other two SHOULD and MUST too strict. I don't think this is aligned with the process we have today in groups and we should not use this document to make the process more strict than it is. Especially I'm not sure what "chairs MUST explicitly confirm consensus" really means and it seems to be a requirement independent of GitHub and therefore eventually would even update <a href="/doc/rfc2481/">RFC2481</a>.<br><br>11) Sec 5.4.4:<br>It might be too late for this kind of input, however, as I review the document I'll note it here anyway. In taps we also have a "discuss" label to mark issue that has been discussed but need further discussion e.g. at an (interim) meeting. For this, one could even create a milestone to indicate at which meeting more discussion should take place (or when e.g. a document is text-ready until when text should be provided). We/the editors also did this for a while in taps.<br><br>12) Section 6 seems to encourage revision only in preparation for meetings. I'm not sure if that is inline with our usual working practice. I mean yes in reality we see the draft submission deadline as forcing function for updates and there want to keep it but we also do encourage to rev documents more often and work continuously, e.g. when a mayor change was implemented or a mayor issue resolved. And yes this works probably better for smaller documents but the section seems a bit contradicting to this practice. I mean the reason that we see many updates just at the draft deadline is because editors assign time to make updates to resolve issue to match the deadline. If editors make continuous changes we should encourage to update more often. Maybe it could rather say something like: "Revisions SHOULD be submitted as I-Ds when a signification issue has been resolved. Editors MAY bundle multiple changes in one revision if updates are done in timely close coherence and SHOULD update at least two weeks before any meeting." However, some of this advise is actually not GitHub specific and might again just touch our general guidelines and as such update <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a>...<br><br>13) sec 7:<br>"&nbsp;  Chairs MUST consider input from all discussion venues when assessing<br>&nbsp;  consensus including GitHub, mailing lists, interim meetings, and IETF<br>&nbsp;  meetings."<br>This seems like an update to <a href="/doc/rfc2481/">RFC2481</a> again... as maybe also some other notes in this section.<br><br>Update: Thanks for replying and considering the TSV-ART review (thanks David for the review!). I don't consider the points raised there as transport-related and leave it to reviewer and editors to further discuss if needed.</div></td>

I have a couple of issue below that touch on the use of normative language and relation to <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a> (as well as maybe <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a>). I guess those could qualify as discuss but I leave them as comments for now trusting in the editors and AD to address them appropriately.<br><br>One general comment:<br>I don't really understand the relationship between this document and draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration. There is a lot of direct overlap especially in section 2 but also in other sections. I understand that this document is BCP and such more appropriate to specify practices normatively but I don't really see why <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration/">draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration</a> is still needed then. The only part that is left to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration/">draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration</a> are ideas about how things could be integrated in the datatracker and with the secretariat. As I say in my discuss ballot for that draft, it is not clear to my why we need an RFC for that at this point of time. If no decision is made yet, this could have also just be integrated e.g. into the appendix on this draft (or even partially in the security considerations section).<br><br>Other comments/questions:<br><br>1) Sec 3.2<br>"...or they might create repositories for individual documents on request."<br>I made a similar comment in my ballot for draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration. I think creating repos for individuals document is maybe not always the best option. I assume the intention here to not out-rule any cases where this might be okay (e.g. if a document is expectd to be adopted soon), however, I would rather prefer to see a recommendation to usually not do that as there can be many individual drafts in the groups and it can provide a wrong signal if repos are created for some and not others.<br><br>2) Sec 4.1.3:<br>"&nbsp;  Issues that have reached a resolution that has Working Group<br>&nbsp;  consensus MUST NOT be reopened unless new information is presented."<br>I do understand the intention here as it is important to make process, however, inline with the rest of the document and the general idea that practises can vary from group to group, I think this really should be a SHOULD NOT only.<br><br>Also further<br>"Resolved issues MUST remain<br>&nbsp;  closed unless there is consensus to reopen an issue."<br>I find this actually a bit strange because it should also then say something like "Resolved issues MUST only be closed with wg consensus"... I guess the word "resolved" is important here but why would you re-open an issue at all if it is resolved? I guess the case is that the wg figures that the issue is not resolved yet. Is the recommendation here for a wg participant to open a new issue if he/she thinks an issue is not fully resolved yet (rather than just re-open)? If so, you should say that.<br><br>3) Sec 4.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Editors SHOULD make pull requests for all substantial changes rather<br>&nbsp;  than committing directly to the "master" branch of the repository."<br>I think this does not align well with how we work today (without GitHub). E.g. if a group decides to use GitHub to better track changes and maybe easily integrate editorial comments, but decide to have all discussion on the mailing list (and not use github issues), I think it would be fully okay for the editors just commit directly based on the consensus on the mailing list. So I think the important part is that substantial comments should only be committed with wg consensus and therefore it is a good practice to have pull requests first to declare consensus based on the concrete proposed edits. However, if a different way to declare consensus is used that's fine as well. In short, I think the SHOULD is to string here for the general case.<br><br>4) Sec 5.3 (mostly editorial):<br>"It is possible to use<br>&nbsp;  different processes for different documents in the Working Group.<br><br>&nbsp;  Working Group chairs SHOULD confirm that the Working Group has<br>&nbsp;  consensus to adopt any process.&nbsp; In particular, the introduction of a<br>&nbsp;  more tightly-controlled process can have the effect of privileging<br>&nbsp;  positions already captured in documents, which might disadvantage<br>&nbsp;  alternative viewpoints."<br>This text seems to apply more general to all content in section 5 and should maybe be moved out of section 5.3. Similarly I'm not sure if section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 should actually be subsection of 5.3. The question of which issue to track seem rather orthogonal to the question who resolves the issue (I agree that this discussion does not make sense when no issue are tracked like in sec 5.1 but it could make sense for the mode in section 5.2)<br><br>5) Sec 5.3.1:<br>"The risk is that<br>&nbsp;  design changes might not always reflect the consensus of the Working<br>&nbsp;  Group."<br>I know that happens, even without GitHub, but should ideally not be the case. However, I think the root cause is rather that changes were incorrectly not identified by the editors as requiring consensus. Maybe this can be reworded accordingly to not give the impression that it is okay to implement design changes in a working group without consensus. Actually this is a broader problem (independent of GitHub) because some editors, especially when they also have been the authors of the individual draft, often implement design changes first in a new version and then ask the working group for consensus. As I said that's a different issue but it could be good to mention that GitHub and the use of PRs can actually help to not use this practice but always each consensus first.<br><br>6) Sec 5.3.1:<br>"... it is likely appropriate to move<br>&nbsp;  to a more tightly controlled process."<br>Maybe add something like "e.g. potentially during or after after working group last call". I think in many groups (that do not use GitHub) it is very common practice that editors have full control about the document. I mean I guess that's their role. I think GitHub really can help to make the process more transparent but it should not be a requirement. Especially shorter documents that had have good consensus form the beginning, there might necessarily be a need to every change that process. (I would say QUIC is rather the other extreme.)<br><br>7) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Chairs might choose to manage the process of deciding which issues<br>&nbsp;  are substantive.&nbsp; For instance, chairs might reserve the ability to<br>&nbsp;  use the "design" label to new issues (see Section 5.4.1) and to close<br>&nbsp;  issues marked as "design".&nbsp; Chairs should always allow document<br>&nbsp;  editors to identify and address editorial issues as they see fit."<br>I guess you could also use normative language here: "MAY choose to" and "Chairs SHOULD always allow"<br><br>8) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  As documents mature further, explicit confirmation of technical<br>&nbsp;  decisions with the Working Group mailing list becomes more important."<br>Not sure I agree here. I know what you mean but explicit confirmation on the mailing list is always important. Maybe there is a way to rephrase that (or just remove that sentence...?)<br><br>9) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  Gaining Working Group consensus about the resolution of issues can be<br>&nbsp;  done in the abstract, with editors being permitted to capture the<br>&nbsp;  outcome of discussions as they see fit."<br>I'm actually not sure what you mean here. Can you clarify?<br><br>10) Sec 5.3.2:<br>"&nbsp;  WGLC SHOULD be proposed as pull requests, and MUST be discussed on<br>&nbsp;  the mailing list, and MUST have chairs explicitly confirm consensus."<br>I agree with the "MUST be discussed on the mailing list" (as this is inline with <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a> e.g. 3.2 but therefore doesn't necessarily need to be normative in this doc) but find the other two SHOULD and MUST too strict. I don't think this is aligned with the process we have today in groups and we should not use this document to make the process more strict than it is. Especially I'm not sure what "chairs MUST explicitly confirm consensus" really means and it seems to be a requirement independent of GitHub and therefore eventually would even update <a href="/doc/rfc2481/">RFC2481</a>.<br><br>11) Sec 5.4.4:<br>It might be too late for this kind of input, however, as I review the document I'll note it here anyway. In taps we also have a "discuss" label to mark issue that has been discussed but need further discussion e.g. at an (interim) meeting. For this, one could even create a milestone to indicate at which meeting more discussion should take place (or when e.g. a document is text-ready until when text should be provided). We/the editors also did this for a while in taps.<br><br>12) Section 6 seems to encourage revision only in preparation for meetings. I'm not sure if that is inline with our usual working practice. I mean yes in reality we see the draft submission deadline as forcing function for updates and there want to keep it but we also do encourage to rev documents more often and work continuously, e.g. when a mayor change was implemented or a mayor issue resolved. And yes this works probably better for smaller documents but the section seems a bit contradicting to this practice. I mean the reason that we see many updates just at the draft deadline is because editors assign time to make updates to resolve issue to match the deadline. If editors make continuous changes we should encourage to update more often. Maybe it could rather say something like: "Revisions SHOULD be submitted as I-Ds when a signification issue has been resolved. Editors MAY bundle multiple changes in one revision if updates are done in timely close coherence and SHOULD update at least two weeks before any meeting." However, some of this advise is actually not GitHub specific and might again just touch our general guidelines and as such update <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC2026</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc2418/">RFC2418</a>...<br><br>13) sec 7:<br>"&nbsp;  Chairs MUST consider input from all discussion venues when assessing<br>&nbsp;  consensus including GitHub, mailing lists, interim meetings, and IETF<br>&nbsp;  meetings."<br>This seems like an update to <a href="/doc/rfc2481/">RFC2481</a> again... as maybe also some other notes in this section.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>BCP, as indicated in the title page header. This is appropriate because the document describes best current practices for using GitHub to aid IETF working group and document development.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes best practices for Working Groups that use GitHub for their work including, for example: guidelines for deciding when and how to use GitHub in working groups, methods for contributing to IETF documents using GitHub, and working group policies for managing document development on GitHub.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>This document collates experience from multiple IETF members with varying levels of experience and expertise with GitHub. As such, it encapsulates knowledge relevant to a wide audience in the IETF. No content has been flagged as particularly controversial (yet).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document is well written and easy to read. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Christopher A. Wood is the Document Shepherd. Alissa Cooper is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document was reviewed in total alongside archived WG correspondence relating to this document. This version of the document is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>This document has strong WG consensus. It received (positive) reviews from multiple individuals with different WG backgrounds. As a whole, the WG understands and agrees with the document's contents.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>BCP, as indicated in the title page header. This is appropriate because the document describes best current practices for using GitHub to aid IETF working group and document development.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes best practices for Working Groups that use GitHub for their work including, for example: guidelines for deciding when and how to use GitHub in working groups, methods for contributing to IETF documents using GitHub, and working group policies for managing document development on GitHub.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>This document collates experience from multiple IETF members with varying levels of experience and expertise with GitHub. As such, it encapsulates knowledge relevant to a wide audience in the IETF. No content has been flagged as particularly controversial (yet).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document is well written and easy to read. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Christopher A. Wood is the Document Shepherd. Alissa Cooper is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document was reviewed in total alongside archived WG correspondence relating to this document. This version of the document is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>This document has strong WG consensus. It received (positive) reviews from multiple individuals with different WG backgrounds. As a whole, the WG understands and agrees with the document's contents.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are no nits. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No. The corresponding document (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration/">draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration</a>) will advance in tandem with this document.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There is one downward normative reference to the companion document draft-ietf-git-github-wg-configuration. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?

If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.
