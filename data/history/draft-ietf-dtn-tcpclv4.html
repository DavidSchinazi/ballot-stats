IIRC we have a thread open with the PKIX extended key purpose DE for how<br>to modify the TLS certificate validation procedures.]<br>========================== discuss section from -21 below ====================<br>[This is essentially a restatement of the comments at<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn/jnafmsDt0OXUhYlBwT_U9PuNV5c/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn/jnafmsDt0OXUhYlBwT_U9PuNV5c/</a><br>but rephrased to be a standalone review rather than continuation of an<br>existing conversation.]<br><br>I'm really impressed by the new text about PKIX environments/CA policy,<br>and entity identification; thank you!<br><br>I suspect that, with one exception, we have similar understandings of<br>what is supposed to happen, but may need to wrangle the actual text on<br>the page a little more to get to the right place.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>The one exception relates to the security properties of having the<br>certificate validation procedure be a prioritized list of steps with<br>which steps to use being dependent on the contents of the received<br>certificate.&nbsp; Specifically, if we will end up letting a peer with a<br>DNS-ID cert authenticate as any node ID, then there is no security gain<br>from having the node ID in the cert in the first place, since the<br>attacker will just skip that step.&nbsp; The value of NODE-ID comes into play<br>when we know, before we go into the validation procedure, that the<br>legitimate peer will have the expected NODE-ID in their certificate.<br>Obviously we cannot expect that to always be the case, given that we aim<br>to be compatible with DTN-Ignorant CAs, so we will need to specify some<br>granularity for when we do or do not require the NODE-ID to be present.<br>There are a number of possibilities here and I don't know which is going<br>to be best for the broadest group of deployments.&nbsp; Some simple ideas for<br>consideration include:<br><br>(a) any given node either always or never requires NODE-ID<br>(b) any given interface either always or never requires NODE-ID<br>(c) push it to the discovery protocol/"out of band configuration"<br>(d) a trust-on-first-use-like option of "once you've seen a NODE-ID for<br>&nbsp; a given node ID, always require NODE-ID in the future for that node<br>&nbsp; ID.&nbsp; (This has pretty significant risks without a way to "undo the<br>&nbsp; latch" but if generating a new node ID is cheap they may be<br>&nbsp; tolerable.)<br>(e) define new URI scheme(s) that have similar semantics to the current<br>&nbsp; ones but require NODE-ID for authentication.<br>(f) similar to (e), apply additional granularity based on URI scheme or<br>&nbsp; scheme-specific structure (e.g., certain prefixes/suffixes of names<br>&nbsp; but not others<br><br>In theory there are similar considerations between DNS-ID and NETWORK-ID<br>(see below for comment about the "NETWORK-ID" name), but since they are<br>both expected to be coming from the Web PKI and both have similarly weak<br>models for node authentication it's not clear to me that we should spend<br>much effort on a complicated procedure for there.&nbsp; Something simple like<br>"if you have a (stable) name for the peer, expect DNS-ID; if you only<br>have an IP address, use NETWORK-ID" should work quite well (and may even<br>be what you intended anyway).<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>The main place where I'm still seeing a need for wordsmithing is in the<br>authentication procedures in Section 4.4.3.&nbsp; I see from the previous<br>discussion that the intent of "SHALL attempt to authenticate [...] If<br> and security policy disallows an unauthenticated ,<br>the entity SHALL terminate the session" is for security policy to be<br>able to say "yes, there's no -ID and I'm fine with that (or<br>potentially even "the -ID that is present failed validation and I'm<br>fine with that"), which is a surprising wording to me but I guess<br>technically okay.&nbsp; (The current wording strongly implies, to me, that <br>if validation fails, the session gets terminated; maybe it's something<br>about the double negative in "disallows an unauthenticated" that makes<br>the "security policy" aspect feel very weak.)&nbsp; What seems significantly<br>problematic to me, though, is the requirement as-written to attempt<br>validation of all three types of ID (NODE-ID, DNS-ID, and NETWORK-ID).<br>In the expected case where a peer's certificate contains only one of the<br>three (or, perhaps, a NODE-ID and one other name type), this means that<br>security policy would have to be some complex matrix with<br>interdependencies between the various types (allow unauthenticated host<br>by DNS-ID if NETWORK-ID present and valid, etc.) that prevents<br>validation of each type of name being performed independently.<br><br>In particular, this "must attempt all three types" logic seems at odds<br>with the first paragraph of the section that says that attempting host<br>name validation is optional.<br><br>So, I would have expected the text to flow more along the lines of (but<br>written less hastily) "security policy determines, for a given connection,<br>which identity type(s) is expected, and validation is attempted for<br>those specific type(s).&nbsp; Failed authentication results in session<br>termination." It is okay with me for security policy to allow continuing<br>with the connection even when validation is attempted but fails, but I'm<br>not sure that we currently have a fully consistent picture about<br>how/when this happens.&nbsp; In particular, I see a note in Section 8.10.1<br>that using TLS in a way which does not authenticate both peers is out of<br>scope of this document" along with a mention of similarities to<br>opportunistic security, yet letting security policy proceed with an<br>unauthenticated peer seems at odds with that "out of scope".&nbsp; We should<br>have a clearer picture of whether opportunistic security with no or<br>failed authentication of one or both peers is permitted by this<br>document.<br><br><br>I think we can also wordsmith the setting of CAN_TLS a little more;<br>previous discussion indicated a desire to (e.g.) not require TLS when<br>operating over IPsec, but that's a different criterion than "capable of<br>exchanging messages [with TLS]".&nbsp; It's also inconsistent with a desire<br>to make TLS support mandatory to implement (but not mandatory to use),<br>since mandatory to implement implies mandatory to be "capable of<br>exchanging messages with TLS", thus mandatory to use.</div></td>

thank you!<br><br>I suspect that, with one exception, we have similar understandings of<br>what is supposed to happen, but may need to wrangle the actual text on<br>the page a little more to get to the right place.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>The one exception relates to the security properties of having the<br>certificate validation procedure be a prioritized list of steps with<br>which steps to use being dependent on the contents of the received<br>certificate.&nbsp; Specifically, if we will end up letting a peer with a<br>DNS-ID cert authenticate as any node ID, then there is no security gain<br>from having the node ID in the cert in the first place, since the<br>attacker will just skip that step.&nbsp; The value of NODE-ID comes into play<br>when we know, before we go into the validation procedure, that the<br>legitimate peer will have the expected NODE-ID in their certificate.<br>Obviously we cannot expect that to always be the case, given that we aim<br>to be compatible with DTN-Ignorant CAs, so we will need to specify some<br>granularity for when we do or do not require the NODE-ID to be present.<br>There are a number of possibilities here and I don't know which is going<br>to be best for the broadest group of deployments.&nbsp; Some simple ideas for<br>consideration include:<br><br>(a) any given node either always or never requires NODE-ID<br>(b) any given interface either always or never requires NODE-ID<br>(c) push it to the discovery protocol/"out of band configuration"<br>(d) a trust-on-first-use-like option of "once you've seen a NODE-ID for<br>&nbsp; a given node ID, always require NODE-ID in the future for that node<br>&nbsp; ID.&nbsp; (This has pretty significant risks without a way to "undo the<br>&nbsp; latch" but if generating a new node ID is cheap they may be<br>&nbsp; tolerable.)<br>(e) define new URI scheme(s) that have similar semantics to the current<br>&nbsp; ones but require NODE-ID for authentication.<br>(f) similar to (e), apply additional granularity based on URI scheme or<br>&nbsp; scheme-specific structure (e.g., certain prefixes/suffixes of names<br>&nbsp; but not others<br><br>In theory there are similar considerations between DNS-ID and NETWORK-ID<br>(see below for comment about the "NETWORK-ID" name), but since they are<br>both expected to be coming from the Web PKI and both have similarly weak<br>models for node authentication it's not clear to me that we should spend<br>much effort on a complicated procedure for there.&nbsp; Something simple like<br>"if you have a (stable) name for the peer, expect DNS-ID; if you only<br>have an IP address, use NETWORK-ID" should work quite well (and may even<br>be what you intended anyway).<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>The main place where I'm still seeing a need for wordsmithing is in the<br>authentication procedures in Section 4.4.3.&nbsp; I see from the previous<br>discussion that the intent of "SHALL attempt to authenticate [...] If<br> and security policy disallows an unauthenticated ,<br>the entity SHALL terminate the session" is for security policy to be<br>able to say "yes, there's no -ID and I'm fine with that (or<br>potentially even "the -ID that is present failed validation and I'm<br>fine with that"), which is a surprising wording to me but I guess<br>technically okay.&nbsp; (The current wording strongly implies, to me, that <br>if validation fails, the session gets terminated; maybe it's something<br>about the double negative in "disallows an unauthenticated" that makes<br>the "security policy" aspect feel very weak.)&nbsp; What seems significantly<br>problematic to me, though, is the requirement as-written to attempt<br>validation of all three types of ID (NODE-ID, DNS-ID, and NETWORK-ID).<br>In the expected case where a peer's certificate contains only one of the<br>three (or, perhaps, a NODE-ID and one other name type), this means that<br>security policy would have to be some complex matrix with<br>interdependencies between the various types (allow unauthenticated host<br>by DNS-ID if NETWORK-ID present and valid, etc.) that prevents<br>validation of each type of name being performed independently.<br><br>In particular, this "must attempt all three types" logic seems at odds<br>with the first paragraph of the section that says that attempting host<br>name validation is optional.<br><br>So, I would have expected the text to flow more along the lines of (but<br>written less hastily) "security policy determines, for a given connection,<br>which identity type(s) is expected, and validation is attempted for<br>those specific type(s).&nbsp; Failed authentication results in session<br>termination." It is okay with me for security policy to allow continuing<br>with the connection even when validation is attempted but fails, but I'm<br>not sure that we currently have a fully consistent picture about<br>how/when this happens.&nbsp; In particular, I see a note in Section 8.10.1<br>that using TLS in a way which does not authenticate both peers is out of<br>scope of this document" along with a mention of similarities to<br>opportunistic security, yet letting security policy proceed with an<br>unauthenticated peer seems at odds with that "out of scope".&nbsp; We should<br>have a clearer picture of whether opportunistic security with no or<br>failed authentication of one or both peers is permitted by this<br>document.<br><br><br>I think we can also wordsmith the setting of CAN_TLS a little more;<br>previous discussion indicated a desire to (e.g.) not require TLS when<br>operating over IPsec, but that's a different criterion than "capable of<br>exchanging messages [with TLS]".&nbsp; It's also inconsistent with a desire<br>to make TLS support mandatory to implement (but not mandatory to use),<br>since mandatory to implement implies mandatory to be "capable of<br>exchanging messages with TLS", thus mandatory to use.</div></td>

I have a couple of thing in the comment section below that should be clarified. But there is one point which does not seem correct to me and therefore I'm raising it at thee discuss level:<br><br>Sec 5.1.1:<br>"Both sides SHALL send a KEEPALIVE message whenever the negotiated interval<br>&nbsp;  has elapsed with no transmission of any message (KEEPALIVE or other).<br><br>&nbsp;  If no message (KEEPALIVE or other) has been received in a session<br>&nbsp;  after some implementation-defined time duration, then the node SHALL<br>&nbsp;  terminate the session by transmitting a SESS_TERM message (as<br>&nbsp;  described in Section 6.1) with reason code "Idle Timeout". "<br><br>It is not necessary that both endpoints send keepalives when TCP is used underneath as data is transmitted reliably. If one end sends keepalives and transmission fails it will close the TCP connection no matter what. Therefore the case where no keepalive is received, can only happen if no keepalive was send by the application, however, if the own keepalives are send successfully it is also received and the TCP connection is alive. If this is only to test liveness of the TCP connection, why don't you use TCP keepalives instead?<br><br>Further what happens when a keepalive fails? Should one endpoint try to reconnect, immediately or later when new data is available?<br><br><br>And one more small thing:<br>sec 6.1:<br>"However, an entity MUST always send<br>&nbsp;  the contact header to its peer before sending a SESS_TERM message."<br>This normative requirement seems contradicting the way version failures are handled earlier on in the doc.</div></td>

In any case this value should be larger than X times the RTT as TCP segments can get lost any might need to be transmitted. I guess something in the order of second would be appropriate?<br><br>3) Sec 4.3:<br>" To prevent a flood<br>&nbsp;  of repeated connections from a misconfigured application, an entity<br>&nbsp;  MAY elect to hold an invalid connection open and idle for some time<br>&nbsp;  before ending it."<br>Not sure why you need to hold it open...? All you need is to not accept but ignore new connections from that peer/IP address for some time.<br>And more questions:<br>&nbsp; - When kept open and you suddenly received a valid message, should you process it? <br>&nbsp; - And when&nbsp; you finally decide to close the connection, how do you do that? TCP RST, or FIN? <br>&nbsp; - Do you send (TCP) keepalives?<br><br>4) Also 4.3:<br>"&nbsp;  The first negotiation is on the TCPCL protocol version to use.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  active entity always sends its Contact Header first and waits for a<br>&nbsp;  response from the passive entity.&nbsp; The active entity can repeatedly<br>&nbsp;  attempt different protocol versions..."<br>If you read on in this section it seems like the receiver always sends a SESS_TERM if the version is not compatible. So I assume you mean the active entity can open a TCP and try again. And I assume it should do it immediately after the SESS_TERM is received. I believe that's what the following paragraphs say but this part confused me a bit. So might be only an editorial issue. Please clarify!<br>However, if there would be any attempt to send another CH on the same TCP connection, that could lead to ambiguity and would need to be further specified.<br>Also more point, the text does not specify what the receiver's response to the CH is. The figure shows that it will also send a CH, however, that should also be spelled out in the text!<br><br>5) sec 4.4.1:<br>"When present, the SNI SHALL contain the same host name<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used to establish the TCP connection."<br>Not sure what this means... how do you use an host name in an TCP connection? Do you mean the same host name that has been used in name resolution to get the IP address that is used to establish the TCP connection? Or something else? <br><br>6) sec 5.1.2:<br>What is the entity receiving the MSG_REJECT supposed to do?<br><br>7) sec 5.2.3: General question on the ACK mechanism: As you say correctly the fact that you don't get a notification is not a TCP protocol matter but only an interface matter. E.g. if taps would be used, this information would be available. Was it considered to make the ACK mechanism optional, e.g. by using a flag in the XFER_SEGMENT to request an ACK per segment?<br>Also more questions: <br> - Why are the message flags reflected?<br> - Why is the Acknowledged length field needed if there needs to be one ACK (send in order) for each segment anyway?<br><br>8) sec 5.2.4: Can you maybe explain why the XFER_REFUSE is a message/feature of the CL and not the BP?<br><br>9) sec 5.2.4:<br>"If a sender receives a XFER_REFUSE message, the sender<br>&nbsp;  MUST complete the transmission of any partially sent XFER_SEGMENT<br>&nbsp;  message.&nbsp; There is no way to interrupt an individual TCPCL message<br>&nbsp;  partway through sending it."<br>Not sure if use of normative language is appropriate here, because I believe what you mean is that as soon as the data/message is given to the TCP connection, you can't call it back. That's just a fact and nothing the sender may or can enforce. However, it could reset the TCP connection effectively but that probably not what is desired. Please clarify or remove normative language!<br><br>10) sec 5.2.5.1: Can you further explain what the use case ifs for the Transfer Length Extension? When do you expect the actual length to be different?<br><br>11) sec 6.1:<br>"&nbsp;  After sending a SESS_TERM message, an entity MAY continue a possible<br>&nbsp;  in-progress transfer in either direction."<br>Why is this necessary? Why can the entity not just send the SESS_TERM after the end of the transfer? Please clarify in the doc!<br><br>12) 6.1:<br>" When performing an unclean shutdown, a receiving node<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD acknowledge all received data segments before closing the TCP<br>&nbsp;  connection."<br>What do you mean here? TCP acknowledgements? If so, this should not be normative as TCP will do that not matter what. However, you can not send any new application data/CL ACK after a TCP FIN was sent. Please clarify!<br><br>13) sec 6.1:<br>"&nbsp;  If a session is to be terminated before a protocol message has<br>&nbsp;  completed being sent, then the node MUST NOT transmit the SESS_TERM<br>&nbsp;  message but still SHALL close the TCP connection. "<br>Not sure how this case is supposed to happen. When give a message to your TCP stack it will send it. If sending fails on the TCP level, the connection will be closed automatically.

The usage of SNI to pick a cert and the DNS-ID (<a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC<br>6125</a>) to authenticate a hostname might imply that the typical "Web PKI"<br>(that deals in hostnames) is intended, but the URIs we need to<br>authenticate Node IDs are not commonly certified by that PKI.&nbsp; Since the<br>server has to present a single certificate even if it is attempting to<br>authenticate as both DNS-ID and the NodeID URI, it seems like it would<br>be challenging to use this scheme in practice against the Web PKI roots.<br>This hybrid of hostname and Node-ID authentication also suffers from an<br>awkward ordering issue when the TLS handshake occurs before the<br>SESS_INIT messages that convey what Node ID is intended to be<br>authenticated -- this requires implementations to use a TLS stack that<br>preserves the peer's certificate and perform name validation after a<br>completed TLS handshake, which is moving more of the complications out<br>of the TLS stack and into the application logic (which introduces risk<br>of security-relevant bugs).&nbsp; It also means that certificate selection<br>must be based solely on SNI hostname and cannot involve the requested<br>Node ID.&nbsp; [There is in theory the selectable name_type field in the TLS<br>server_name extension, but in practice that joint has rusted shut and it<br>seems unlikely that there would be much implementation traction to<br>define a name type for DTN Node ID; <a href="/doc/rfc6066/">RFC 6066</a> also fails to give a clear<br>indication of the intended semantics when multiple name types are<br>present.]<br><br>Please double-check for lingering text that assumes the <a href="/doc/rfc7242/">RFC 7242</a><br>behaviors where all parameters are in the contact header (vs. SESS_INIT)<br>and use of SDNV encoding vs. fixed-lengths.&nbsp; I noted several instances<br>in the COMMENT section, but do not claim to have made an exhaustive<br>review.</div></td>

A TCPCL session is terminated when the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TCP connection ends, due either to one or both entities actively<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; closing the TCP connection or due to network errors causing a<br>&nbsp;

 Session State Changed:&nbsp; The TCPCL supports indication when the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; session state changes.&nbsp; The top-level session states indicated<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are:<br><br>Is this an indication from the TCPCL Entity to the BP agent?&nbsp; (Similarly<br>for "Idle Changed", etc.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ongoing transfer.&nbsp; Because TCPCL transmits serially over a TCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connection, it suffers from "head of queue blocking" this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indication provides information about when a session is available<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for immediate transfer start.<br><br>nit: run-on sentence.<br><br>&nbsp;  Begin Transmission:&nbsp; The principal purpose of the TCPCL is to allow a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BP agent to transmit bundle data over an established TCPCL<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; session.&nbsp; Transmission request is on a per-session basis, the CL<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; does not necessarily perform any per-session or inter-session<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; queueing.&nbsp; Any queueing of transmissions is the obligation of the<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>&nbsp;  Transmission Failure:&nbsp; The TCPCL supports positive indication of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certain reasons for bundle transmission failure, notably when the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; peer entity rejects the bundle or when a TCPCL session ends before<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transfer success.&nbsp; The TCPCL itself does not have a notion of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transfer timeout.<br><br>I'm sure there is a subtle distinction here between a "TCPCL notion of<br>transfer timeout" and the underlying TCP connection timing out on<br>retransmissions, but I'm not sure what it is, yet.<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  negotiate the use of TLS security (as described in Section 4).&nbsp; Once<br>&nbsp;  contact negotiation is complete, TCPCL messaging is available and the<br>&nbsp;  session negotiation is used to set parameters of the TCPCL session.<br>&nbsp;  One of these parameters is a Node ID of each TCPCL Entity.&nbsp; This is<br>&nbsp;  used to assist in routing and forwarding messages by the BP Agent and<br>&nbsp;  is part of the authentication capability provided by TLS.<br><br>I might phrase this as "the Node ID that each TCPCL Entity is acting<br>as".<br><br>&nbsp;  Once negotiated, the parameters of a TCPCL session cannot change and<br>&nbsp;  if there is a desire by either peer to transfer data under different<br>&nbsp;  parameters then a new session must be established.&nbsp; This makes CL<br>&nbsp;  logic simpler but relies on the assumption that establishing a TCP<br>&nbsp;  connection is lightweight enough that TCP connection overhead is<br>&nbsp;  negligable compared to TCPCL data sizes.<br><br>(I assume this assumption holds true ~universally for DTN TCPCL<br>consumers?)<br><br>&nbsp;  There is no fundamental limit on the number of TCPCL sessions which a<br>&nbsp;  single node can establish beyond the limit imposed by the number of<br>&nbsp;  available (ephemeral) TCP ports of the passive entity.<br><br>"epehemeral TCP ports" on the passive entity seems like a typo, as<br>Section 4.1 suggests that the passive entity usually uses the assigned<br>port 4556 and the source port on the active entity is an ephemeral one.<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 4.3).&nbsp; Regardless of the reason, session termination is<br>&nbsp;  initiated by one of the entities and responded-to by the other as<br>&nbsp;  illustrated by Figure 13 and Figure 14.&nbsp; Even when there are no<br>&nbsp;  transfers queued or in-progress, the session termination procedure<br>&nbsp;  allows each entity to distinguish between a clean end to a session<br>&nbsp;  and the TCP connection being closed because of some underlying<br>&nbsp;  network issue.<br><br>[This is also useful for TLS connections, as proper usage of<br>bidirectional "close_notify" alerts is far from universal.]<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>It would probably be worth expanding "PCH" and "PSI" on first use rather<br>than last use.<br><br>&nbsp;  Contact negotiation involves exchanging a Contact Header (CH) in both<br>&nbsp;  directions and deriving a negotiated state from the two headers.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  contact negotiation sequencing is performed either as the active or<br>&nbsp;  passive entity, and is illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6<br>&nbsp;  respectively which both share the data validation and analyze final<br>&nbsp;  states of the "[PCH]" activity of Figure 7 and the "[TCPCLOSE]"<br>&nbsp;  activity which indicates TCP connection close.&nbsp; Successful<br><br>I'm not sure what "analyze final states" is intended to mean.&nbsp; (It shows<br>up again later, in discussion of Figure 10.)<br><br>Where does [PCH] occur in Figure 6?&nbsp; (Should the "[PSI]" be changed to<br>"[PCH]"?)<br><br>Several of the figures have "negotiate " steps that do not have<br>possible paths for failure of negotiation; only Figure 4 seems to have a<br>disclaimer that it only shows the "nominal" case.<br><br>&nbsp;  Session termination involves one entity initiating the termination of<br>&nbsp;  the session and the other entity acknowledging the termination.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  either entity, it is the sending of the SESS_TERM message which<br>&nbsp;  transitions the session to the ending substate.&nbsp; While a session is<br>&nbsp;  being terminated only in-progress transfers can be completed and no<br>&nbsp;  new transfers can be started.<br><br>Would it be more clear to say "is in the ending substate" than the<br>current "is being terminated"?<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Each TCPCL session allows a negotiated transfer segmentation polcy to<br><br>nit: "policy"<br><br>&nbsp;  be applied in each transfer direction.&nbsp; A receiving node can set the<br>&nbsp;  Segment MRU in its contact header to determine the largest acceptable<br><br>nit: this is in SESS_INIT now, not the contact header.<br><br>&nbsp;  attempt, and it SHOULD use a (binary) exponential back-off mechanism<br><br>Thank you for specifying the base of the exponent!<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  established, the entity SHALL close the TCP connection.&nbsp; The ordering<br>&nbsp;  of the contact header exchange allows the passive entity to avoid<br>&nbsp;  allocating resources to a potential TCPCL session until after a valid<br>&nbsp;  contact header has been received from the passive entity.&nbsp; This<br><br>I'm pretty sure that the passive entity is not going to get a contact<br>header from itself.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>It might be worth discussing the invariants of the contact<br>header/protocol, akin to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-9.3">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-9.3</a><br>(though presumably less complicated!), since we are changing how things<br>work between TCPCLv3 and TCPCLv4.<br><br>&nbsp;

Just so you know...<br><br>Thank you for the work on this stuff.&nbsp; I have a number of comments, a few of which are substantive but minor; the rest are editorial and don’t need explicit responses.<br><br>The substantive ones:<br><br>— Section 3.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Session State Changed:&nbsp; The TCPCL supports indication when the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; session state changes.<br><br>What does “supports indication” mean?&nbsp; Are you saying that the TCPCL “indicates when the session state changes”?&nbsp; Or does some other entity provide those indications?&nbsp; If the latter, it would be better to say what entity or entities do that, something like, “The TCPCL supports indications of session state changes from the BP agent.”&nbsp; It should also be clear, whatever entity provides the indications, whether they always happen or are optional.&nbsp; For example, can we *rely* on getting “Sesson Negotiating” and “Established” indications, or is it an implementation/deployment/configuration choice that they’re produced?&nbsp; (Same comment for Session Idle Changed, and all other items in this section that talk about indications.)<br><br>— Section 4.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  If the<br>&nbsp;  passive entity does not receive a Contact Header after some<br>&nbsp;  implementation-defined time duration after TCP connection is<br>&nbsp;  established, the entity SHALL close the TCP connection.<br><br>Should there be any recommendation about that implementation-defined time duration, as there is in the previous paragraph?&nbsp; No judgment here, but just a question.&nbsp; I’ll note that if I never close the TCP connection I can say that I’m obeying the “SHALL”, and it’s just that my implementation defines the time duration at 17 years.<br><br>— Section 4.4 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Once<br>&nbsp;  established, there is no mechanism available to downgrade a TCPCL<br>&nbsp;  session to non-TLS operation.&nbsp; If this is desired, the entire TCPCL<br>&nbsp;  session MUST be terminated and a new non-TLS-negotiated session<br>&nbsp;  established.<br><br>I suggest that it’s unlikely that this will be necessary, and I suggest being stronger about not doing it.&nbsp; Does this work for you?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Once<br>&nbsp;  established, there is no mechanism available to downgrade a TCPCL<br>&nbsp;  session to non-TLS operation.&nbsp; If such a downgrade is necessary,<br>&nbsp;  the entire TCPCL session would have to be terminated and a new<br>&nbsp;  non-TLS-negotiated session established.&nbsp; This is NOT RECOMMENDED.<br>END<br><br>— Section 6.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  After sending a SESS_TERM message, an entity MAY continue a possible<br>&nbsp;  in-progress transfer in either direction.&nbsp; After sending a SESS_TERM<br>&nbsp;  message, an entity SHALL NOT begin any new outgoing transfer for the<br>&nbsp;  remainder of the session.&nbsp; After receving a SESS_TERM message, an<br>&nbsp;  entity SHALL NOT accept any new incoming transfer for the remainder<br>&nbsp;  of the session.<br><br>Checking something here… according to this, if A sends SESS_TERM to B:<br>- A MUST NOT begin a new transfer to B<br>- B MUST NOT accept a new transfer from A<br>- But B is allowed to begin a new transfer to A, and A can accept it<br><br>Is that as intended?<br><br>- - - - - - - - <br><br>Editorial comments:<br><br>— Section 1.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;

 Idle Session:&nbsp; A TCPCL session is idle while the only messages being<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transmitted or received are KEEPALIVE messages.<br><br>It would be useful to have a forward reference here, “(see Section 5.1.1)”.<br><br>&nbsp;  Live Session:&nbsp; A TCPCL session is live while any messages are being<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transmitted or received.<br><br>Maybe “while any messages other than KEEPALIVEs are being...”<br><br>— Section 3.3 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The states of a nominal TCPCL session (i.e. without session failures)<br>&nbsp;  are indicated in Figure 4.<br><br>Why “nominal”?&nbsp; Or do you mean to say “normal”?&nbsp; (And “i.e.” needs a comma after it throughout the document, as does “e.g.”.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Session "Live" means transmitting or reeiving over a transfer<br><br>Typo: “receiving”<br><br>— Section 3.4 —<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a situation where network "goodput" is dynamic, the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transfer segmentation size can also be dynamic<br><br>It may be cute, but is there really a need to make up that word and use it just once?&nbsp; Will everyone understand it, or will it just make some people (whose grasp of English isn’t as good as ours) pause and wonder for an unnecessary moment?&nbsp; I don’t feel strongly about it — just asking the question.<br><br>— Section 4 —<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, some sessions MAY be opened proactively and<br>&nbsp;  maintained for as long as is possible given the network conditions,<br>&nbsp;  while other sessions MAY be opened only when there is a bundle that<br><br>I think these are not <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> “MAY”, but just plain English “may” (or “might”).<br><br>— Section 4.1 —<br><br>&nbsp;  Therefore, the entity MUST retry the<br>&nbsp;  connection setup no earlier than some delay time from the last<br>&nbsp;  attempt<br><br>This starts to look as though “the entity MUST retry the connection setup”, which is not what you mean.&nbsp; You can avoid this by moving the negative, and I think it reads more cleanly that way:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Therefore, the entity MUST NOT retry the<br>&nbsp;  connection setup without some delay time from the last attempt<br>END<br><br>— Section 4.3 —<br><br>&nbsp;  The first negotiation is on the TCPCL protocol version to use.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  active entity always sends its Contact Header first and waits for a<br>&nbsp;  response from the passive entity.&nbsp; The active entity can repeatedly<br>&nbsp;  attempt different protocol versions in descending order until the<br>&nbsp;  passive entity accepts one with a corresponding Contact Header reply.<br>&nbsp;  Only upon response of a Contact Header from the passive entity is the<br>&nbsp;  TCPCL protocol version established and parameter negotiation begun.<br><br>&nbsp;  During contact initiation, the active TCPCL node SHALL send the<br>&nbsp;  highest TCPCL protocol version on a first session attempt for a TCPCL<br>&nbsp;  peer.&nbsp; If the active entity receives a Contact Header with a<br>&nbsp;  different protocol version than the one sent earlier on the TCP<br>&nbsp;  connection, the TCP connection SHALL be closed.&nbsp; If the active entity<br>&nbsp;  receives a SESS_TERM message with reason of "Version Mismatch", that<br>&nbsp;  node MAY attempt further TCPCL sessions with the peer using earlier<br>&nbsp;  protocol version numbers in decreasing order.&nbsp; Managing multi-TCPCL-<br>&nbsp;  session state such as this is an implementation matter.<br><br>The latter paragraph repeats some of what’s in the former, as though they were written separately and pasted together.&nbsp;

Why is this the proper type of RFC? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>A Proposed Standard is being requested.&nbsp; This is the appropriate type of RFC <br>because the specification documented in the current Internet Draft describes<br>a protocol that is being implemented and used on the Internet. The title page <br>header indicates that the intended status is Standards Track. <br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. <br><br>DOCUMENT ANNOUNCEMENT<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Document Announcement Write-Up for Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence <br>Layer Protocol Version 4<br><br>Ed Birrane<br>18 June 2019<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes the Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence Layer <br>Protocol Version 4 (TCPCLv4) for use with the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) <br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis/">I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis</a>]. <br><br>The BPv7 implements a store-and-forward overlay network suitable for <br>delay-tolerant message exchange. The protocol data unit for the BPv7 is the <br>"bundle". BPv7 agents require convergence layer adapters (CLAs) to send and <br>receive "bundles" using the service of some "native" link, network, or <br>Internet protocol. Both the BPv7 and its CLAs reside at the application layer <br>of the Internet model protocol stack [<a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC1122</a>]. <br><br>The TCPCLv4 describes a CLA that sends and received bundles using the well-known <br>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This specification describes the format and <br>processing of the protocol data units passed between entities participating in <br>TCPCLv4 communications.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>TCPCLv4 is descended from an experimental IRTF specification TCPCLv3 [<a href="/doc/rfc7242/">RFC7242</a>]. <br>Implementation experience with TCPCLv3 identified limitations such as ambiguity <br>in bundle acknowledgment and refusal, non-normative discussion on how to <br>incorporate TLS, and minor inefficiencies associated with sequencing. TCPCLv4 <br>was created to address those limitations and prepare the specification for <br>non-experimental use. Technical discussions over the last 3 years have been<br>well informed and focused on TLS negotiations, overall protocol agent state <br>machines, and a protocol extension mechanism. There is no controversy related <br>to the adoption of the specification; DTNWG consensus on the draft is strong. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The workflow for TCPCLv4 remained largely unchanged from that of TCPCLv3 for <br>which reference implementations exist. Co-author B. Sipos has created a <br>reference implementation of TCPCLv4 to demonstrate features and ensure the <br>clarity of the draft. Much of the recent review provided by the DTNWG focused <br>on increasing the overall clarity of the specification to ensure no ambiguities <br>exist for implementers. There have been no problems discovered with the <br>reference implementation for this draft. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The Document Shepherd is Ed Birrane.<br><br>The Responsible Area Director is Magnus Westerlund.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Shepherd. <br><br>The Document Shepherd has been reviewing and commenting on drafts of this <br>specification since March of 2017 (IETF 98).&nbsp; The current edition of the <br>specification is considered ready for publication. <br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No. Reviews have been performed by persons with a good understanding of the<br>Bundle Protocol and the concept of convergence layer adapters. Original authors<br>of the TCPCLv3 also reviewed and refined this specification, as have<br>implementers in the context of a reference implementation. <br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The Document Shepherd does not perceive any need for review from additional <br>perspectives. The DTNWG reviews have covered Bundle Protocol concepts, and the<br>use of TCP and TLS in this specification follows established norms. <br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; be aware of.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns or issues with this document.&nbsp; <br>Technical questions have been discussed at length and resolved by consensus <br>within the WG. Much of the recent discussion in the WG has focused on ensuring<br>that concepts are clear and this current revision of the specification has<br>accomplished that clarity.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have indicated no known IPR disclosures for this work. <br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br> <br>There is no known IPR disclosure that directly references this document. <br>However, the DTNWG mailing list indicated the existence of a patent <br>(USPTO #7,930,379)that may or may not have applicability to DTN systems in <br>general. This was brought to the attention of the DTNWG, DTNWG chairs, and<br>responsible AD.<br><br>The responsible AD has responded that unless additional IPR disclosures are <br>provided this document can progress. <br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>This document appears to the Document Shepherd to represent the solid consensus <br>of the WG. There have been no dissenting opinions relating to its most recent <br>specifications in the WG itself or on the WG mailing list. Several WG members <br>have experience with the preexisting TCPCLv3 that this specification replaces, <br>with using Bundle Protocol, and with the concept and use of convergence layer <br>adapters. The WG as a whole understands the intent, capabilities, design, and <br>approach presenting in this specification. <br><br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No threatened appeal or extreme discontent has been evident in the WG meetings <br>or on the mailing list.<br><br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. <br><br>There are some nits in the document, but nothing serious and nothing than <br>cannot be easily remedied. <br><br>According to ID Nits check:<br><br>1 ERROR:<br><br>&nbsp; 1) Obsolete normative reference: <a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC 5246</a> has been obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>.<br><br>8 WARNINGS:<br><br>&nbsp; 1-6) Warnings identify a "missing reference" for items that are not meant to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be references. These warning are considered false positives and refer to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  labels used in examples and illustrations.<br><br>&nbsp; 7) Warning for out of date reference to bpbis.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>A Proposed Standard is being requested.&nbsp; This is the appropriate type of RFC <br>because the specification documented in the current Internet Draft describes<br>a protocol that is being implemented and used on the Internet. The title page <br>header indicates that the intended status is Standards Track. <br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. <br><br>DOCUMENT ANNOUNCEMENT<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Document Announcement Write-Up for Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence <br>Layer Protocol Version 4<br><br>Ed Birrane<br>18 June 2019<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes the Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence Layer <br>Protocol Version 4 (TCPCLv4) for use with the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) <br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis/">I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis</a>]. <br><br>The BPv7 implements a store-and-forward overlay network suitable for <br>delay-tolerant message exchange. The protocol data unit for the BPv7 is the <br>"bundle". BPv7 agents require convergence layer adapters (CLAs) to send and <br>receive "bundles" using the service of some "native" link, network, or <br>Internet protocol. Both the BPv7 and its CLAs reside at the application layer <br>of the Internet model protocol stack [<a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC1122</a>]. <br><br>The TCPCLv4 describes a CLA that sends and received bundles using the well-known <br>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This specification describes the format and <br>processing of the protocol data units passed between entities participating in <br>TCPCLv4 communications.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>TCPCLv4 is descended from an experimental IRTF specification TCPCLv3 [<a href="/doc/rfc7242/">RFC7242</a>]. <br>Implementation experience with TCPCLv3 identified limitations such as ambiguity <br>in bundle acknowledgment and refusal, non-normative discussion on how to <br>incorporate TLS, and minor inefficiencies associated with sequencing. TCPCLv4 <br>was created to address those limitations and prepare the specification for <br>non-experimental use. Technical discussions over the last 3 years have been<br>well informed and focused on TLS negotiations, overall protocol agent state <br>machines, and a protocol extension mechanism. There is no controversy related <br>to the adoption of the specification; DTNWG consensus on the draft is strong. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The workflow for TCPCLv4 remained largely unchanged from that of TCPCLv3 for <br>which reference implementations exist. Co-author B. Sipos has created a <br>reference implementation of TCPCLv4 to demonstrate features and ensure the <br>clarity of the draft. Much of the recent review provided by the DTNWG focused <br>on increasing the overall clarity of the specification to ensure no ambiguities <br>exist for implementers. There have been no problems discovered with the <br>reference implementation for this draft. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The Document Shepherd is Ed Birrane.<br><br>The Responsible Area Director is Magnus Westerlund.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Document Shepherd. <br><br>The Document Shepherd has been reviewing and commenting on drafts of this <br>specification since March of 2017 (IETF 98).&nbsp; The current edition of the <br>specification is considered ready for publication. <br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No. Reviews have been performed by persons with a good understanding of the<br>Bundle Protocol and the concept of convergence layer adapters. Original authors<br>of the TCPCLv3 also reviewed and refined this specification, as have<br>implementers in the context of a reference implementation. <br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The Document Shepherd does not perceive any need for review from additional <br>perspectives. The DTNWG reviews have covered Bundle Protocol concepts, and the<br>use of TCP and TLS in this specification follows established norms. <br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; be aware of.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns or issues with this document.&nbsp; <br>Technical questions have been discussed at length and resolved by consensus <br>within the WG. Much of the recent discussion in the WG has focused on ensuring<br>that concepts are clear and this current revision of the specification has<br>accomplished that clarity.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>3 of 4 authors have indicated no known IPR disclosures for this work. <br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br> <br>There is no known IPR disclosure that directly references this document. <br>However, the DTNWG mailing list indicated the existence of a patent <br>(USPTO #7,930,379)that may or may not have applicability to DTN systems in <br>general. This was brought to the attention of the DTNWG, DTNWG chairs, and<br>responsible AD.<br><br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>This document appears to the Document Shepherd to represent the solid consensus <br>of the WG. There have been no dissenting opinions relating to its most recent <br>specifications in the WG itself or on the WG mailing list. Several WG members <br>have experience with the preexisting TCPCLv3 that this specification replaces, <br>with using Bundle Protocol, and with the concept and use of convergence layer <br>adapters. The WG as a whole understands the intent, capabilities, design, and <br>approach presenting in this specification. <br><br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br><br>No threatened appeal or extreme discontent has been evident in the WG meetings <br>or on the mailing list.<br><br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. <br><br>There are some nits in the document, but nothing serious and nothing than <br>cannot be easily remedied. <br><br>According to ID Nits check:<br><br>1 ERROR:<br><br>&nbsp; 1) Obsolete normative reference: <a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC 5246</a> has been obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>.<br><br>8 WARNINGS:<br><br>&nbsp; 1-6) Warnings identify a "missing reference" for items that are not meant to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be references. These warning are considered false positives and refer to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  labels used in examples and illustrations.<br><br>&nbsp; 7) Warning for out of date reference to bpbis. The specification refers to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis/12/">draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-12</a> and should refer to draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-13.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; 8) Warning for out of date reference to bpsec.

The absence of Updates or Supersedes language in the Abstract <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  seems appropriate because the superseded document was experimental. <br><br>&nbsp; 2) The document date (March 31, 2019) is 80 days in the past. This date <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  references the publication date of the current version of the specification.<br><br>According to the Internet-Draft Checklist:<br><br>&nbsp; Checklist 2.2.10: Verbatim replication of the IPR Disclosure is not provided.<br><br>&nbsp; Checklist 2.2.11: Verbatim replication of the IPR Notice, and Copyright Notice <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Disclosure are not provided.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; Checklist 3.8: The specification includes a section 7 "Implementation status" <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  which details the TCPCLv4 reference implementation.

If such normative <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The Internet-Draft for Bundle Protocol Version 7 (bpbis) is referenced as a <br>normative document.&nbsp; The bpbis document is being forwarded to the IESG at the <br>same time as the TCPCLv4 document itself. <br><br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references, aside from the error (detected by <br>ID Nits) as noted in section 11.<br><br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br><br>No.<br><br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.
