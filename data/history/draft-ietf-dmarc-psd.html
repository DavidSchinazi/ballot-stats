For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>The community believes there is a strong need for this work.&nbsp; As ARC was also recently published as experimental (<a href="/doc/rfc8617/">RFC8617</a>), this is a ripe time for considering ecosystem solutions such as this.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No expressions of appeal-level discontent have been observed so far.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting here that Dave Crocker raised and pressed an objection that the work should not be published without going back to first principles with DMARC itself, which would set the already glacial working group back months.&nbsp; Given the WG intends to reopen its base document anyway after this experiment is published, that seems like an unnecessary constraint.&nbsp; In any case, his assertion does not appear to have swayed consensus away from proceeding.<br><br>He also contends that an experiment meant to collect data and then be destroyed is not the kind of thing the IETF should be publishing in the first place, since it represents something that could introduce confusion or cruft into the deployed base.&nbsp; I disagreed with this position because there are existence proofs of Experimental status not observing such constraints.&nbsp; His objection has not been sustained by the working group generally; one person was concerned about us publishing an experiment of any kind, but this was not enough to give the impression that consensus has eroded.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the working group is prepared to accept Informational status if the IESG concurs with this objection.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and<br>&nbsp;  Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating<br>&nbsp;  organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for<br>&nbsp;  message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving<br>&nbsp;  organization can use to improve mail handling.&nbsp; DMARC policies can be<br>&nbsp;  applied to individual domains or to all domains within an<br>&nbsp;  organization.&nbsp; The design of DMARC precludes grouping policies for<br>&nbsp;  domains based on policy published above the organizational level,<br>&nbsp;  such as TLDs (Top Level Domains).&nbsp; Domains at this higher level of<br>&nbsp;  the DNS tree (but not necessarily at the top of the DNS tree) can be<br>&nbsp;  collectively referred to as Public Suffix Domains (PSDs).&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes an extension to DMARC to enable DMARC<br>&nbsp;  functionality PSDs.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>The working group came to consensus fairly quickly about this proposal because it's fairly minimal, straightforward, and well understood.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>There is one implementation already (by the author), and numerous operators have expressed intent to participate, including open source and private operators, once the document is approved.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Murray Kucherawy is the responsible Area Director, though he was the document shepherd at the time this went to IETF Last Call.<br>Alexey Melnikov is the new document shepherd.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I reviewed the document for both editorial and technical quality.&nbsp; It has appropriate IANA and Security Considerations sections.&nbsp; An appropriate WGLC was performed and feedback received was folded in by the author.&nbsp; The WG secretary also assured that all raised issues were addressed somehow.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>None; ART and SEC reviews are expected in due course, and otherwise enough of the usual IETF email community and participants in M3AAWG also provided input.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No such specialist reviews are needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>The community believes there is a strong need for this work.&nbsp; As ARC was also recently published as experimental (<a href="/doc/rfc8617/">RFC8617</a>), this is a ripe time for considering ecosystem solutions such as this.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No such disclosure has been filed.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There are about 15-20 regular active working group participants, and consensus among them for this experimental document appears to be firm.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No expressions of appeal-level discontent have been observed so far.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting here that Dave Crocker raised and pressed an objection that the work should not be published without going back to first principles with DMARC itself, which would set the already glacial working group back months.&nbsp; Given the WG intends to reopen its base document anyway after this experiment is published, that seems like an unnecessary constraint.&nbsp; In any case, his assertion does not appear to have swayed consensus away from proceeding.<br><br>He also contends that an experiment meant to collect data and then be destroyed is not the kind of thing the IETF should be publishing in the first place, since it represents something that could introduce confusion or cruft into the deployed base.&nbsp; I disagreed with this position because there are existence proofs of Experimental status not observing such constraints.&nbsp; His objection has not been sustained by the working group generally; one person was concerned about us publishing an experiment of any kind, but this was not enough to give the impression that consensus has eroded.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the working group is prepared to accept Informational status if the IESG concurs with this objection.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>No ID nits have been identified.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal reviews are needed; this document makes no registrations of media types or other major code points.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No; all referenced documents are published.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>This is an experimental document.&nbsp; There can only be up-refs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document describes an experiment.&nbsp; Should the experiment move to the standards track, it will update <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a>.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a> was an Independent Submission and therefore currently has Informational status.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a> is under review by the DMARC working group, which intends to republish it on to the standards track at some future date.&nbsp; It will take the results of this experiment as input.&nbsp; However, this document does not formally modify <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a>.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>I have reviewed the IANA Considerations section.&nbsp; It makes a single registration in an extant registry for which I am the designated expert.&nbsp; The section is well-formed and clear.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>This document creates no new registry.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There is no ABNF, XML, or MIB definition in this document.&nbsp; There's not even ASCII art.&nbsp; Stop smothering me.</div></td>

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No such specialist reviews are needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>The community believes there is a strong need for this work.&nbsp; As ARC was also recently published as experimental (<a href="/doc/rfc8617/">RFC8617</a>), this is a ripe time for considering ecosystem solutions such as this.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No such disclosure has been filed.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There are about 15-20 regular active working group participants, and consensus among them for this experimental document appears to be firm.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No expressions of appeal-level discontent have been observed so far.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting here that Dave Crocker raised and pressed an objection that the work should not be published without going back to first principles with DMARC itself, which would set the already glacial working group back months.&nbsp; Given the WG intends to reopen its base document anyway after this experiment is published, that seems like an unnecessary constraint.&nbsp; In any case, his assertion does not appear to have swayed consensus away from proceeding.<br><br>He also contends that an experiment meant to collect data and then be destroyed is not the kind of thing the IETF should be publishing in the first place, since it represents something that could introduce confusion or cruft into the deployed base.&nbsp; I disagreed with this position because there are existence proofs of Experimental status not observing such constraints.&nbsp; His objection has not been sustained by the working group generally; one person was concerned about us publishing an experiment of any kind, but this was not enough to give the impression that consensus has eroded.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the working group is prepared to accept Informational status if the IESG concurs with this objection.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>No ID nits have been identified.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal reviews are needed; this document makes no registrations of media types or other major code points.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No; all referenced documents are published.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>This is an experimental document.&nbsp; There can only be up-refs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document describes an experiment.&nbsp; Should the experiment move to the standards track, it will update <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a>.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a> was an Independent Submission and therefore currently has Informational status.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a> is under review by the DMARC working group, which intends to republish it on to the standards track at some future date.&nbsp; It will take the results of this experiment as input.&nbsp; However, this document does not formally modify <a href="/doc/rfc7489/">RFC7489</a>.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.
