It might be worth just saying here its meant for what a<br>user would consider a call in most common cases.<br><br>3.1 - you confused me:-) 3rd para says "three parties" but<br>earlier you said "exactly two." I think what you mean is that<br>the term party might have different meanings in different<br>protocols? (It becomes clear later though.)<br><br>4.3 - if a privacy enhancing B2BUA is present, then I don't<br>think I buy the proposition that it won't mess with the session<br>id. <br><br>4.4 - typo s/where/were/<br><br>4.6 - first use of "restrictive" seems wrong. I think you mean<br>lax or maybe expressive or permissive (as the secdir review<br>suggested).<br><br>5 - REQ9 could contradict what I'd like to see in REQ4. (Just<br>noting that.)<br><br>7 - saying you MUST NOT use MAC address etc is not right. You<br>could use those, so long as they cannot be derived from the<br>session ID, e.g. "AES(k,MAC||random)" could be used for a k<br>known only the the initiator perhaps. I'm not saying you <br>should do that, but that the MUST NOT seems OTT.<br><br>7 - I don't get how the integrity requirements stated can be<br>independent of the n/w infrastructure etc. To me, that reads<br>like text added to just sound good, so I must be missing<br>something about it - can you explain the last paragraph a bit<br>more?</div></td>

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)?

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>This document does not need reviews from a particular or a from a broader perspective. The solution document might need such wider reviews, but this is not appropriate for a requirements document.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.
