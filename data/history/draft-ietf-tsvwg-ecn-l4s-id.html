If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Among the 3 documents, this ECN one is where the specific usage of ECT(1) is discussed, that is the most contentious.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>- Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.&nbsp; As a possible supplement for the limited ECN codepoints, the working group considered pros and cons of different means of using DSCP values, multiple times over the life of these documents.&nbsp; Some participants preferred approaches relying on DSCP, based on their view of the tradeoffs. <br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of meaning possible at different points in the network for CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces when L4S is deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - There is not full agreement on whether L4S with this use of ECN codepoints is safe for experimentation on either parts of the Internet, or the Internet as a whole.&nbsp; The WG has a separate draft-ietf-tsvwg-l4s-ops document intended to help describe potential problems and how to avoid them when enabling L4S in networks.&nbsp;  Related to this, when the WG was polled in the May 2021 interim about suitability for experimentation in parts of the Internet, about 20 people agreed (over half of the ~35 attendees), and about a half dozen disagreed.&nbsp; Minutes of this meeting are at: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/</a>.<br>&nbsp;  - The matter of safety was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads.&nbsp; Specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, and the operator guidelines I-D added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation and tools available.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the potential for classic incompatibility, and want to resolve that incompatibility by obsoleting <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a> at the present time.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>).&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>) advice as-written at that time and directly interpreted now.<br>&nbsp;  - Several working group participants reject the design based on this, and have agreed with this logic described to the working group in detail: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/</a><br>&nbsp;  - Related to this, several also would prefer that in conjunction with the required classic bottleneck detection, that realtime fallback should be mandatory for transports to implement and use.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Some believe that realtime fallback (rather than simply offline means) is needed for safety, noting that they don't think it is clear how a user would be notified of a safety problem or who they would contact in the event that one occurred.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - On this topic specifically, one person said on the mailing list: "And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>'s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Reasons why the WG was satisfied with a 'SHOULD' rather than 'MUST' for realtime fallback are explained in Section 4.3.1 and Appendix A.1.5 of this document.<br>- A potential vector for DoS of tunneled traffic was described, based on marking the traffic selectively, and causing inadequately scaled replay windows (as in IPsec) to then be violated as some packets receive low latency and others do not.&nbsp;  This condition was recognized in the WG as able to affect regular traffic without any intent of an attack.&nbsp;  It was addressed and is explicitly discussed in section 6.2, however, it is not fully agreed upon as having been settled by some who raised the concern.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.&nbsp; During work on this document, it came up that in the future <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>)may need to be updated, but this particular document does not do that.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations clearly describe one update to an existing registry, that is specifically identified and fully described.&nbsp; There are no new registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A - no formal languages are used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A.<br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network<br>&nbsp;  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).<br>&nbsp;  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP<br>&nbsp;  layer that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,<br>&nbsp;  except as specified within.&nbsp; L4S uses 'scalable' congestion control,<br>&nbsp;  which induces much more frequent control signals from the network and<br>&nbsp;  it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments, so that<br>&nbsp;  very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low<br>&nbsp;  queuing delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising<br>&nbsp;  link utilization.&nbsp; Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can<br>&nbsp;  have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during<br>&nbsp;  periods of high traffic load.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from<br>&nbsp;  'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.&nbsp; It gives an incremental<br>&nbsp;  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can<br>&nbsp;  distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the<br>&nbsp;  Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and<br>&nbsp;  low loss of L4S traffic.&nbsp; This specification defines the rules that<br>&nbsp;  L4S transports and network elements need to follow with the intention<br>&nbsp;  that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance nor that of<br>&nbsp;  Classic traffic.&nbsp; Examples of new active queue management (AQM)<br>&nbsp;  marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like<br>&nbsp;  or real-time) are specified separately.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd, and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Among the 3 documents, this ECN one is where the specific usage of ECT(1) is discussed, that is the most contentious.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>- Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp;

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network<br>&nbsp;  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).<br>&nbsp;  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP<br>&nbsp;  layer that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,<br>&nbsp;  except as specified within.&nbsp; L4S uses 'scalable' congestion control,<br>&nbsp;  which induces much more frequent control signals from the network and<br>&nbsp;  it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments, so that<br>&nbsp;  very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low<br>&nbsp;  queuing delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising<br>&nbsp;  link utilization.&nbsp; Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can<br>&nbsp;  have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during<br>&nbsp;  periods of high traffic load.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from<br>&nbsp;  'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.&nbsp; It gives an incremental<br>&nbsp;  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can<br>&nbsp;  distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the<br>&nbsp;  Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and<br>&nbsp;  low loss of L4S traffic.&nbsp; This specification defines the rules that<br>&nbsp;  L4S transports and network elements need to follow with the intention<br>&nbsp;  that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance nor that of<br>&nbsp;  Classic traffic.&nbsp; Examples of new active queue management (AQM)<br>&nbsp;  marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like<br>&nbsp;  or real-time) are specified separately.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd, and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Among the 3 documents, this ECN one is where the specific usage of ECT(1) is discussed, that is the most contentious.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>- Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.&nbsp; As a possible supplement for the limited ECN codepoints, the working group considered pros and cons of different means of using DSCP values, multiple times over the life of these documents.&nbsp; Some participants preferred approaches relying on DSCP, based on their view of the tradeoffs. <br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of meaning possible at different points in the network for CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces when L4S is deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - There is not full agreement on whether L4S with this use of ECN codepoints is safe for experimentation on either parts of the Internet, or the Internet as a whole.&nbsp; The WG has a separate draft-ietf-tsvwg-l4s-ops document intended to help describe potential problems and how to avoid them when enabling L4S in networks.&nbsp;  Related to this, when the WG was polled in the May 2021 interim about suitability for experimentation in parts of the Internet, about 20 people agreed (over half of the ~35 attendees), and about a half dozen disagreed.&nbsp; Minutes of this meeting are at: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/</a>.<br>&nbsp;  - The matter of safety was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads.&nbsp; Specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, and the operator guidelines I-D added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation and tools available.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the potential for classic incompatibility, and want to resolve that incompatibility by obsoleting <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a> at the present time.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>).&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>) advice as-written at that time and directly interpreted now.<br>&nbsp;  - Several working group participants reject the design based on this, and have agreed with this logic described to the working group in detail: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/</a><br>&nbsp;  - Related to this, several also would prefer that in conjunction with the required classic bottleneck detection, that realtime fallback should be mandatory for transports to implement and use.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Some believe that realtime fallback (rather than simply offline means) is needed for safety, noting that they don't think it is clear how a user would be notified of a safety problem or who they would contact in the event that one occurred.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - On this topic specifically, one person said on the mailing list: "And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>'s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Reasons why the WG was satisfied with a 'SHOULD' rather than 'MUST' for realtime fallback are explained in Section 4.3.1 and Appendix A.1.5 of this document.<br>- A potential vector for DoS of tunneled traffic was described, based on marking the traffic selectively, and causing inadequately scaled replay windows (as in IPsec) to then be violated as some packets receive low latency and others do not.&nbsp;  This condition was recognized in the WG as able to affect regular traffic without any intent of an attack.&nbsp;  It was addressed and is explicitly discussed in section 6.2, however, it may not be fully agreed upon as having been settled by some who raised the concern.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state?

 - The matter of safety was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads.&nbsp; Specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, and the operator guidelines I-D added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation and tools available.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the potential for classic incompatibility, and want to resolve that incompatibility by obsoleting <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a> at the present time.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>).&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>) advice as-written at that time and directly interpreted now.<br>&nbsp;  - Several working group participants reject the design based on this, and have agreed with this logic described to the working group in detail: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/</a><br>&nbsp;  - Related to this, several also would prefer that in conjunction with the required classic bottleneck detection, that realtime fallback should be mandatory for transports to implement and use.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Some believe that realtime fallback (rather than simply offline means) is needed for safety, noting that they don't think it is clear how a user would be notified of a safety problem or who they would contact in the event that one occurred.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - On this topic specifically, one person said on the mailing list: "And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>'s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  - Reasons why the WG was satisfied with a 'SHOULD' rather than 'MUST' for realtime fallback are explained in Section 4.3.1 and Appendix A.1.5 of this document.<br>- A potential vector for DoS of tunneled traffic was described, based on marking the traffic selectively, and causing inadequately scaled replay windows (as in IPsec) to then be violated as some packets receive low latency and others do not.&nbsp;  This condition was recognized in the WG as able to affect regular traffic without any intent of an attack.&nbsp;  It was addressed and is explicitly discussed in section 6.2, however, it may not be fully agreed upon as having been settled by some who raised the concern.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.&nbsp; During work on this document, it came up that in the future <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>)may need to be updated, but this particular document does not do that.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations clearly describe one update to an existing registry, that is specifically identified and fully described.&nbsp; There are no new registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A - no formal languages are used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network<br>&nbsp;  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).<br>&nbsp;  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP<br>&nbsp;  layer that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,<br>&nbsp;  except as specified within.&nbsp; L4S uses 'scalable' congestion control,<br>&nbsp;  which induces much more frequent control signals from the network and<br>&nbsp;  it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments, so that<br>&nbsp;  very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low<br>&nbsp;  queuing delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising<br>&nbsp;  link utilization.&nbsp; Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can<br>&nbsp;  have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during<br>&nbsp;  periods of high traffic load.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from<br>&nbsp;  'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.&nbsp; It gives an incremental<br>&nbsp;  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can<br>&nbsp;  distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the<br>&nbsp;  Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and<br>&nbsp;  low loss of L4S traffic.&nbsp; This specification defines the rules that<br>&nbsp;  L4S transports and network elements need to follow with the intention<br>&nbsp;  that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance nor that of<br>&nbsp;  Classic traffic.&nbsp; Examples of new active queue management (AQM)<br>&nbsp;  marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like<br>&nbsp;  or real-time) are specified separately.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd, and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Among the 3 documents, this ECN one is where the specific usage of ECT(1) is discussed, that is the most contentious.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>- Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.&nbsp; As a possible supplement for the limited ECN codepoints, the working group considered pros and cons of different means of using DSCP values, multiple times over the life of these documents.&nbsp; Some participants preferred approaches relying on DSCP, based on their view of the tradeoffs. <br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of meaning possible at different points in the network for CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces when L4S is deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - There is not full agreement on whether L4S with this use of ECN codepoints is safe for experimentation on either parts of the Internet, or the Internet as a whole.&nbsp; The WG has a separate draft-ietf-tsvwg-l4s-ops document intended to help describe potential problems and how to avoid them when enabling L4S in networks.&nbsp;  Related to this, when the WG was polled in the May 2021 interim about suitability for experimentation in parts of the Internet, about 20 people agreed (over half of the ~35 attendees), and about a half dozen disagreed.&nbsp; Minutes of this meeting are at: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2021-tsvwg-01-202105101100/</a>.<br>&nbsp;

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network<br>&nbsp;  service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S).<br>&nbsp;  L4S uses an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP<br>&nbsp;  layer that is similar to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach,<br>&nbsp;  except as specified within.&nbsp; L4S uses 'scalable' congestion control,<br>&nbsp;  which induces much more frequent control signals from the network and<br>&nbsp;  it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments, so that<br>&nbsp;  very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low<br>&nbsp;  queuing delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising<br>&nbsp;  link utilization.&nbsp; Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can<br>&nbsp;  have high bandwidth and very low delay at the same time, even during<br>&nbsp;  periods of high traffic load.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from<br>&nbsp;  'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly) traffic.&nbsp; It gives an incremental<br>&nbsp;  migration path so that suitably modified network bottlenecks can<br>&nbsp;  distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the<br>&nbsp;  Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and<br>&nbsp;  low loss of L4S traffic.&nbsp; This specification defines the rules that<br>&nbsp;  L4S transports and network elements need to follow with the intention<br>&nbsp;  that L4S flows neither harm each other's performance nor that of<br>&nbsp;  Classic traffic.&nbsp; Examples of new active queue management (AQM)<br>&nbsp;  marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like<br>&nbsp;  or real-time) are specified separately.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd, and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Among the 3 documents, this ECN one is where the specific usage of ECT(1) is discussed, that is the most contentious.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>- Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.<br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of meaning possible at different points in the network for CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces when L4S is deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.&nbsp; This was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads, and specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, plus the operator guidelines I-D for L4S added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the potential for classic incompatibility, and want to resolve that incompatibility by obsoleting <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a> at the present time.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>).&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>) advice as-written at that time and directly interpreted now.<br>&nbsp;  - At least one working group participant rejects the design based on this, and has described their logic to the working group in detail: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/</a><br>&nbsp;

If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed.

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not full agreement.<br>-&nbsp;  Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.<br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of meaning for CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces when L4S is deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.&nbsp; This was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads, and specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, plus the operator guidelines I-D for L4S added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the potential for classic incompatibility.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>).&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>) advice as-written at that time and directly interpreted now.<br>&nbsp;  - At least one working group participant rejects the design based on this, and has described their logic to the working group in detail: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/BULldNtilkiChD7rPKDyEdssFlw/</a><br>&nbsp;  - Another working group participant with concern about this agreed they might be classified "in the rough" regarding one specific point:<br>"And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>'s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br>- A potential vector for DoS of tunneled traffic was described, based on marking the traffic selectively, and causing inadequately scaled replay windows (as in IPsec) to then be violated as some packets receive low latency and others do not.&nbsp;  This condition was recognized in the WG as able to affect regular traffic without any intent of an attack.&nbsp;  It was addressed and is explicitly discussed in section 6.2, however, it may not be fully agreed upon as having been settled by some who raised the concern.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state?

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.&nbsp; During work on this document, it came up that in the future <a href="/doc/bcp124/">BCP 124</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>)may need to be updated, but this particular document does not do that.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport protocols, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be additional security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>Regarding this ECN document specifically, there are a number of specific concerns that resulted in only a "rough" consensus and not fully agreement.<br>- Some WG participants do not like the ambiguity of CE and ECT1 that this draft introduces, when deployed alongside classic ECN queues or hosts.&nbsp; This coexistence has been considered at length by the WG and accepted along with several mitigating factors that have been introduced.&nbsp; Particularly there is a possibility to negatively impact non-L4S flows when a classic bottleneck is shared and L4S responds to the CE bits differently.&nbsp; This was discussed in detail in WG meetings and mailing list threads, and specific work on classic bottleneck detection was performed and documented, plus the operator guidelines I-D for L4S added further considerations on the presence of classic bottlenecks.&nbsp; The implementers and operators discussing deployments seem to understand the concern and are comfortable with the situation.<br>- A few WG participants favor making this Standards Track rather than Experimental, because of the classic incompatibility.&nbsp; There was not wide support for this, and it is felt that that the WG is not yet ready to pursue this path of deprecating <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>.&nbsp; The WG may discuss deprecating 3168 in the future, in parallel with L4S experimentation, but not as a prerequisite to L4S experimentation.<br>- One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>.&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a> advice.&nbsp; After polite discussion, one working group participant agreed they might be classified "in the rough" regarding one specific point:<br>"And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>’s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.&nbsp; During work on this document, it came up that in the future <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a> may need to be updated, but this particular document does not do that.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations clearly describe one update to an existing registry, that is specifically identified and fully described.&nbsp; There are no new registries.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A - no formal languages are used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>TODO<br><br>One question that came up in the WG process was how this particular L4S identifier approach relates to the advice in <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>.&nbsp; After WG discussions, and work between the chairs and editors, new text was included to describe this was included in the document.&nbsp; Although the WG feels it is safe and the most desirable available approach, the point remains that this does not have pure conformance with the <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a> advice.&nbsp; After polite discussion, one working group participant agreed they might be classified "in the rough" regarding one specific point:<br>"And rather than going in circles again, as I said originally I propose to agree to disagree on the one remaining point (re: SHOULD NOT be sent across classic queues, MUST NOT be so sent repeatedly and persistently).&nbsp; I don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that essentially all current and future deployed marking queues use a sufficiently good fq hash to allow for disregarding of <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a>’s model for new ECN semantics, nor that the problem-detection approach is robust enough (not even sure it’s coherent enough) to rely on as the basis for the key normative requirements for a safe operational congestion response."<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S and this particular usage of ECN to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only small nits, that would be easy to handle after AD review.&nbsp; There are outdated references to the other L4S and NQB documents, and warnings about non-ASCII characters.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.&nbsp; During work on this document, it came up that in the future <a href="/doc/rfc4774/">RFC 4774</a> may need to be updated, but this particular document does not do that.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>TODO<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A - no formal languages are used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A.<br></div></td>
