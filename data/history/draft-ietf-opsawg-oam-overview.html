Does the second statement mean that either the hardware<br>will throw away messages with unknown, new TLVs, complain about such<br>messages or have poor performance?&nbsp; If so, the "easily" in the first<br>statement is possibly "easily but impractically".&nbsp; A little explanation<br>is probably needed (or maybe this is just too complex to explain here).<br>Maybe reducing all this to "LSP Ping is extensible using additional TLVs<br>but there may be hardware issues (see RFC...)." <br><br>Nits/editorial comments:<br>General: s/i.e./i.e.,/, s/e.g./e.g.,/ (a couple of missing cases)<br><br>General: It would be helpful to use non-breaking hyphens in MPLS-TP and<br>all references if possible.<br><br>s1.2, first bullet: s/Standard development/Standards development/<br><br>s1.3: It would be useful to put a forward reference to the terminology<br>section 2.1 to cover the various acronyms and abbreviations in Table 1.<br><br>s3, 2nd bullet: s/also allows to detect/also allows detection of/&nbsp; It<br>might also be appropriate to be a bit less definite about localization -<br>add in 'attempts' or 'tries' maybe?<br><br>s3, Delay Measurement: Maybe mention 'jitter' as an alternative for<br>delay variation.<br><br>s4.3.3, 2nd bullet: s/a failure is detected/a failure is reported/<br><br>s4.3.3, last para: s/i.e. no failures are detected,/i.e., when no<br>failures have been detected,/<br><br>s4.3.3, last para: "...negotiated transmission time" Do you mean<br>"transmission rate" as mentioned in the previous para?&nbsp; If not it might<br>be good to make it clear that this isn't a typo.<br><br>s4.4.1, para 4 (after 2nd bullet): s/and also Maximum Transmission Unit<br>(MTU) problems/and also identify Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)<br>problems/<br><br>s4.4.1, para 5: s/the MPLS faults/MPLS faults/<br><br>s4.5.1, 2nd bullet: <br>and there is a need to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  differentiate OAM packets from data plane ones.<br>This is slightly confusing - the congruence requirement makes all the<br>packets (OAM and user) to be data plane packets. How about:<br><br>and there is a need to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  differentiate OAM packets from ordinary user packets in the data plane.<br><br><br>s4.5.1, Maintencance Intermediate Point section:<br>A MIP in MPLS-TP identifies OAM packets destined<br>&nbsp; to it by the value of the TTL field in the OAM packet.<br>This is not terribly helpful: Either a reference to where to find out<br>what TTL value is needed or some explanation of the required value would<br>be a good idea.<br><br>s4.5.1, Up and Down MEPs:<br>The term "bridge interface" is IEEE/MPLS-TP jargon and needs defining.<br>Might be also worth a note that, unlike prior usage of up/down, this has<br>nothing to do with defects (or layabout parliamentarians in<br>Brussels). ;-)<br><br>s4.5.3: Please add a reference for PWE3 ACH and VCCV and a pointer to a<br>document where "PW control word" is defined (preferably with section<br>numbers.<br><br>s4.5.4.6: s/if there a return path exists/if a return path exists/<br><br>s4.7.3, last para: s/Server accepts the modes./Server accepts the mode./<br><br>s4.7.3, last para: I think there is a bit of interaction missing: (i)<br>server tells Session-sender to start sending; (ii) if Control-client<br>stops the session, it tells server and server tells Session-sender;<br>(iii) when session is finished Session-sender reports to Server which<br>recovers data from Session-receiver (or controls Fetch client?) <br><br>s5.1, Traceroute: Should this mention the Paris traceroute?<br><br>s5.1, OWAMP/TWAMP: For consistency should probably reference RFCs.<br><br>s5.3: s/in as much accuracy/with as much accuracy/</div></td>

The Introduction says this (and it's also in the Abstract):<br><br>&nbsp;  This document focuses on tools for detecting and isolating failures<br>&nbsp;  and for performance monitoring. Hence, this document focuses on the<br>&nbsp;  tools used for monitoring and measuring the data plane; control and<br>&nbsp;  management aspects of OAM are outside the scope of this document.<br><br>But the title says this:<br>"An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools"<br><br>Might it be better to change the title to something that indicates that it's limited, and not an overview of *all* OAM tools?&nbsp; Something, maybe, like "An Overview of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Tools for Detecting and Isolating Failures and for Performance Monitoring"<br><br>I know that makes for a long title, but I think it's better than overselling the document.<br><br><br>2.<br>-- Section 1.2 --<br><br>&nbsp;  It should be noted that this document is not necessarily suitable for<br>&nbsp;  beginners without any background in OAM.<br><br>I'd think that a statement of what's necessary would be more useful.&nbsp; Pick one or two references that are the most critical, perhaps, and say something like this instead:<br><br>&nbsp;  It should be noted that some background in OAM is necessary in order<br>&nbsp;  to understand and benefit from this document.&nbsp; [OAM-Def] and [..other..]<br>&nbsp;  are particularly important starting points.<br><br><br>3. Further to that point, I see that you have no normative references.&nbsp; Perhaps you think that Informational documents don't need normative references, an opinion I don't share.&nbsp; I think that the references that are required in order to understand the document at hand are normative references, regardless of the status of the document at hand.&nbsp; I'm not making this a DISCUSS point, but I strongly urge you to do a separation of the references, and at least move the most critical ones into a Normative References section, to make it clear to the reader which documents absolutely have to be read as background material.</div></td>

I<br>am left with just a few that I carry over as Comments, this time.<br><br>---<br><br>I still feel that sections 4.1 and 4.2 should include some mention of<br>OAM in multicast IP scenarios. Perhaps this got added somewhere else,<br>but&nbsp; couldn't find it.<br><br>---<br><br>I should have liked Section 6 to have included a discussion of the <br>security considerations of OAM in general, and the security provisions<br>available for the various OAM mechanisms discussed. What you have<br>still seems like a bid of a dodge.</div></td>

Since a document written as a tutorial for a beginner <br>has different requirements from that written for a subject <br>matter expert this clarification is important in terms of <br>expectations in terms of depth and precision of the text. A <br>tutorial document for the beginner would be most welcome <br>considering the extent of OAM discussions that have taken <br>place in the IETF and it is assumed by the reviewer that <br>this is the intent of the document.<br><br>To that end the document needs to - <br><br>Include&nbsp; a “Historical Background”&nbsp; session that goes <br>beyond the single sentence in Section 1 (“OAM was originally <br>used in the world of telephony, and has been adopted in packet <br>based networks”)<br><br>Provide a clear view of OAM functionality and its relationship <br>to various “planes” of networking (data plane, control plane, <br>management plane). In particular, the importance of <br>fate-sharing of OAM and user traffic flows in packet networks <br>should be explained.<br><br>Explicitly map the ideas,&nbsp; terms and methods that have been <br>adopted&nbsp; from technologies owned by ITU-T and/or IEEE to&nbsp; <br>IETF-owned technologies.&nbsp; If such a mapping is not possible, <br>it should be explicitly stated.<br><br>Explain in a neutral way points of contention regarding <br>various OAM-related issues.<br><br>The draft as written is is a partial annotated list of <br>references to IETF and non-IETF protocols and mechanisms that <br>deal with certain aspects of OAM in IP, IP/MPLS, MPLS-TP <br>and Ethernet networks. The draft does not describe the underlying<br>reasons for selecting particular protocols for description.<br><br>It is not clear why the now obselete is ITU-T Y.1711 considered <br>in detail. The reviewer proposed giving consideration to I.610 <br>as a protocol, although I am not sufficinetly familiar with <br>I.610 to determine its relevence. It should however be examined. <br>Similarly it may be useful to introduce the reader to E-LMI <br>(defined by MEF).<br><br>In terms of MPLS-TP why is there no discussion of MPLS-TP <br>fault management OAM - (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-fault/05/">draft-ietf-mpls-tp-fault-05</a>) is omitted??<br><br>There are a number of readibility issues that arrise from the <br>terms and concepts taken from&nbsp; the referenced documents <br>having different meaning in these documents.&nbsp; E.g.,. in Section 4.1<br>the draft states that ICMP ping provides “connectivity <br>verification for Internet Protocol”. However, in Section 3.2.4 <br>the draft says that “connectivity verification function allows <br>an MP to check whether it is connected to a peer MP or not”. <br>Since MPs are not mentioned with regard to ICMP, it is not <br>clear whether “connectivity verification” means the same thing <br>in these two cases.<br><br>In some cases the text is detailed beyond the needs of the <br>beginner, whilst other imporatnt concepts are not detailed <br>sufficiently for example:<br><br>- The OWAMP TCP port information is not needed, whilst the IPPM <br> <br>- In Section 3.2.3 the draft defines the term “Maintenance <br>Entity” (ME), whilst “Maintenance Entity Group” (MEG), a.k.a. <br>“Maintenance Association (MA), is only defined by reference<br><br>-&nbsp; In Section 4.5.2 the draft mentions security aspects of <br>IPPM protocols. Howeverwhilst, these aspects are not even <br>mentioned in Section 4.2. discussing BFD.<br><br>The document therefore needs another pass to ensure <br>consistency of detail.<br><br> <br><br>Major Issues:<br><br> <br> The concepts of data plane, control plane and management <br>plane are not well explored in the draft and need to <br>expained with their OAM context.<br><br>=======<br><br>The relationship between OAM functionality and network <br>management as presented in the draft is unclear.&nbsp; <br>For example<br><br>a. (Section 1) Other aspects associated with the OAM <br>acronym, such as management, are outside the scope of <br>this&nbsp; document&nbsp; &lt;&gt;<br><br>b. (Section 4.6.4)&nbsp;  The FDI function is used by <br>an LSR to report a defect to affected client layers, <br>allowing them to suppress alarms&nbsp; about this defect <br>&lt;&lt; Alarms are arguable part of management &gt;&gt;<br><br>c. (Section 4.7.2) When the ETH-CC function detects <br>a defect, it reports one of the following defect conditions:<br><br>i. Loss of continuity (LOC): Occurs when at least when <br>no CCM messages have been received from a peer MEP during <br>a period of 3.5 times the configured transmission period <br><br>iii. Unexpected period: Occurs when the transmission <br>period field in the CCM does not match the expected <br>transmission period value&nbsp; &lt;&lt; Since transmission period <br>field in ETH-CC is defined by management, this defect <br>reports a management issue&gt;<br><br>d. (Section 4.7.6)&nbsp;  The Alarm Indication Signal <br>indicates that a MEG should suppress alarms about <br>a defect condition at a lower MEG level, i.e., since <br>a defect has occurred in a lower hierarchy in the <br>network, it should&nbsp;  not be reported by the current node&nbsp; <br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>e. (Section 4.7.9)&nbsp;  The Y.1731 standard defines the <br>frame format for Automatic Protection&nbsp;  Switching <br>frames. The protection switching operations are defined <br>in&nbsp; other ITU-T standards. &lt;&gt;<br><br>3.&nbsp;  OAM in connectionless vs. connection-oriented networks:<br><br>a. (2a) above suggests that OAM is applicable only <br>to connection-oriented networks (if you do not have <br>connections, connection problems do not exist by definition)<br><br>b. At&nbsp; the same time, the draft discusses ICMP Ping <br>(Section 4.1) operating in connectionless IP networks, <br>and Ethernet OAM (Sections&nbsp; 4.7 and 4.8) operating <br>in connectionless Ethernet networks.<br><br> The authors should define the scope of OAM explicitly <br>and clearly - and then remove the sections dealing with <br>protocols and mechanisms that happen to be out of this <br>scope. In particular, explaining the relationship of <br>each specific defect to a specific networking plane.<br><br> <br><br> MEs, MPs, MEPs and MIPs<br><br> <br>Caveat: It may well be that the problem is not with the <br>draft but with the concept itself (or at least with the <br>attempts to extend it to IP, IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP networks)<br><br>Consider the following statements:<br><br> <br>1. (Section 3.2.2)&nbsp;  A Maintenance Entity (ME) <br>is a point-to-point relationship between two Maintenance <br>Points (MP). The connectivity between these Maintenance <br>Points is managed and monitored by the OAM protocol.&nbsp; <br>A pair of MPs engaged in an ME are connected by a Communication Link<br><br>2. (Section 3.2.3) A Maintenance Point (MP) is a <br>functional entity that is defined at a node in the <br>network, and either initiates or reacts to OAM messages. <br>A Maintenance End Point (MEP) is one of the end points of an ME, <br>and&nbsp; can initiate OAM messages and respond to them. A Maintenance <br>Intermediate Point (MIP) is an intermediate point between two MEPs, <br>that does not initiate OAM frames, but is able to respond to <br>OAM&nbsp; frames that are destined to it, and to forward others.<br><br>3. (Section 3.2.3)&nbsp; The 802.1ag defines a finer distinction <br>between Up MPs and Down MPs. An MP is a bridge <br>interface, that is monitored by an OAM protocol…<br><br>4. (Section 4.1)&nbsp;  ICMP provides a connectivity <br>verification function for the Internet Protocol… ICMP is <br>also used in Traceroute for path discovery.<br><br>An OAM beginner would not be able to answer the following <br>questions:<br><br>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can a communication link exist without any <br>MPs on it?<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose that I have defined a P2P bidirectional <br>communication link with two MEPs&nbsp; forming an ME.&nbsp; What <br>would happen to this ME if I add a MIP between the two MEPs?<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the relationship (if any) between MEPs <br>and interfaces? Or is it just something specific to Ethernet bridges?<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does a MIP really forward OAM frames that <br>are not destined to it? <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Operation of ICMP Ping does not require creation of <br>MPs. How does it provide a connectivity verification function for IP?<br><br>The authors need to remove conflicting definitions, to fix typos <br>(e.g., the definition of ME would be less problematic if it referred <br>to a pair of MEPs and not to a pair of MPs) and inaccurate statements <br>(in IP, IP/MPLS and MPLS-TP MIPs (as a component) do NOT forward <br>OAM packets that are not destined to them – but they do <br>that in Ethernet OAM).<br><br> <br>Minor Issues:<br><br>Connectivity Check vs. Continuity Check<br><br> The draft mainly uses the term “Continuity Check”. However, <br>in some places the term “Connectivity Check” is used as well, e.g.:<br><br>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Section 4.12) A key element in some of the OAM standards <br>that are analyzed in this document is the continuity check. It is <br>thus important&nbsp; to present a more detailed comparison of the <br>connectivity check mechanisms defined in OAM standards.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Section 4.3)&nbsp; LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping <br>operation (of data-plane connectivity and continuity check)…<br><br>Please look at the use of the terms and ensure they are <br>applied consistently.<br> <br><br>Caveat: Similar inconsistency in IEEE 802.1ag (but not in ITU-T Y.1731).<br><br><br>Continuity Check vs. Connectivity Verification<br><br>In Section 3.2.4. the draft refers to&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5860/">RFC 5860</a> as the ultimate<br> source of information about the difference between Continuity <br>Check and Connectivity Verification. Looking up <a href="/doc/rfc5860/">RFC 5860</a> (Section 2.2.3),<br> I’ve learned that connectivity verification is a function that <br>allows an End Point to find out whether it is connected to a specific <br>End Point(s) by means of an expected PW, LSP or Section. At the same <br>time, the draft says (in the same Section 3.2.4) that “A connectivity <br>verification function allows an MP to check whether it is connected <br>to a peer MP or not”.&nbsp; The omitted&nbsp; words from <a href="/doc/rfc5860/">RFC 5860</a> “by means of…” <br>make such a definition unclear; also it is unclear whether End Points <br>(of Section, LSP or PW) which, presumably, are MEPs, can be <br>extended to be MEPs or MIPs (the draft uses the term MPs).<br><br>It is also not clear whether the draft considers LSP Ping (see <br>Section 4.3.) functionality “to verify data-plane vs. control-plane <br>consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)”&nbsp; as&nbsp; related to <br>Connectivity Verification. This is especially strange since the <br>draft also states (in the same section)&nbsp; that “LSP Ping extends the <br>basic ICMP Ping operation”&nbsp; while Section 4.1 states that “ICMP <br>provides a connectivity verification function for the Internet&nbsp;  Protocol”.&nbsp; <br><br> <br>Another problem is the statement (in Section 4.2.3) that “BFD <br>Echo provides a connectivity verification function”, especially <br>since <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi/05/">draft-ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi-05</a> in Section 3.5 expands <br>format of the BFD control packets in order to provide CV function, <br>while BFD Echo is not even mentioned in this document. It might be<br> worth noting that we are not considering BFD Echo mode for MPLS-TP.<br><br>Finally, the draft does not explain whether there is any <br>correlation between the defects detected by the continuity <br>check and those detected by connectivity verification <br>(Section 4.10.3.1 looks&nbsp; a logical place for this).<br><br> <br><br>Inaccurate Representation of IEEE 802.1ag<br><br><br>In Section 3.2.3 of the draft theer is the following text:<br><br>“The 802.1ag defines a finer distinction between Up MPs and Down <br>MPs. An MP is a bridge interface, that is monitored by an OAM <br>protocol either in the direction facing the network, or in the <br>direction&nbsp; &nbsp; facing the bridge. A Down MP is an MP that receives <br>OAM packets from,&nbsp; &nbsp; and transmits them to the direction of the <br>network. An Up MP receives OAM packets from, and transmits <br>them to the direction of the bridging entity”.<br><br> <br>However IEEE 802.1ag states (see Section 22.1.3 of that <br>document ) that: “All Up MEPs belonging to MAs that are attached <br>to specific VIDs are placed between the Frame filtering entity <br>(8.6.3) and the Port filtering entities (8.6.1, 8.6.2, and 8.6.4). <br>Separately for each VLAN, there can be from zero to eight Up <br>MEPs, ordered by increasing MD Level, from Frame filtering <br>towards Port filtering”.<br><br> <br>That seems to imply that 802.1ag MEPs are NOT bridge interfaces <br>(since there can be are multiple MEPs per VLAN and multiple <br>VLANs per bridge interface).<br><br><br>Defects, Faults and Failures<br><br>In Section 3.2.5 the draft discusses the terms Defect, Fault <br>and Failure. However, these terms seem to apply to the <br>“communication link” the term needs to be clarified to <br>indicate that this is a data plane entity, or the term data <br>plane used in its place.<br><br>At the same time, “Unexpected Period” and “Unexpected MEP” <br>are mentioned as defects detected by ETH-CC in Section 4.7.2 <br>even if, to the best of my understanding, these conditions <br>are side effects of mis-configuration i.e., a management plane problem.<br><br> <br><br>VCCV: An OAM Mechanism or a Control Channel?<br><br><br>In Section 4.4. the draft states that VCCV “provides <br>end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs”. <br>This seems to point that VCCV is an OAM mechanism/protocol.<br><br>However, later in the same section is states that “The <br>VCCV switching function provides a control channel associated <br>with each PW… and allows sending OAM packets in-band with PW data”.&nbsp; <br>And on the next line it explains that “VCCV currently supports <br>the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping, and BFD” <br>(which are all mentioned as OAM mechanisms providing <br>continuity check and/or connectivity verification in the draft). <br>So it remains completely unclear whether VCCV is an OAM <br>mechanism or just a channel for separating user data from OAM flows.<br><br>The issue here may well be historic because VCCV predates <br>the modern ACH mechanism. This should be clarified in the text.<br> <br><br>MEs, MEGs and MEG levels<br><br>The draft explicitly defines a Maintenance Entity (ME) in <br>Section 3.2.2, but defers to MPLS-TP OAM Framework for <br>the definition of the Maintenance Entity Group (MEG). The <br>text defining ME in the draft differs from that in the <br>MPLS-T_ OAM Framework document&nbsp; <br>(see <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework/?include_text=1">http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework/?include_text=1</a>, Section 2.2). <br>At the same time, it resembles the definition of ME in <br>Section 3.1 of this document.<br><br>MEG level is mentioned a couple of times in the draft, <br>but the only explanation given (in Section 4.7.2) is <br>“The MEG level is a 3-bit number that defines the level <br>of hierarchy of the MEG”; and this seems to be the only <br>text in the draft that deals with MEG hierarchy. A more <br>details description should be provided.<br><br><br>Differences between Approaches to Packet/Frame Loss Measurement<br><br> There is no description the fundamental difference <br>between two approaches to measuring packet loss – <br>that of the IPPM WG (based on counting synthetic packets) <br>and that of Y.1731 (based on counting the user packets), <br>even if both are mentioned in the draft. MPLS-TP BTW <br>provides a tool for doing loss measurement and notes <br>that the instrumentation technique is independent of <br>the method of making the measuremnet.</div></td>
