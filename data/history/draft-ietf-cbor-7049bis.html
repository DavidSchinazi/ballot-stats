Since I'm a big fan of CBOR and try to evangelize it whenever possible I'm please to see this happening.<br><br>However, I have one minor annoyance with CBOR, which is the range of negative numbers that are encoded in major type 1.&nbsp; My gripe is that the encoding allows for negative integers that are not easily representable in a simple form in most programming languages without using something equivalent to BigInteger.<br><br>E.g., all values below -2^63 won't fit into a int64 type, and the value 2^64 won't even fit into an uint64 that was used to represent a negative number (obviously unless it followed the CBOR encoding semantics of being offset by 1)<br><br>For a generic decoder I presume that this isn't an issue since it can fallback to something like BigInteger.&nbsp; But for other decoders handling normal sized integer datatypes I would presume that they would effectively presumably regard anything smaller than -2^63 as not well-formed for their specific problem domain.<br><br>I'm not suggesting that this should be changed (hence comment not a discuss), but there are a couple of places in the document that it might be helpful to warn implementors about this, that I have mentioned below.<br><br>Other minor comments:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Specification of the CBOR Encoding<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Major type 0:&nbsp; an integer in the range 0..2**64-1 inclusive.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; value of the encoded item is the argument itself.&nbsp; For example,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the integer 10 is denoted as the one byte 0b000_01010 (major type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0, additional information 10).&nbsp; The integer 500 would be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0b000_11001 (major type 0, additional information 25) followed by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the two bytes 0x01f4, which is 500 in decimal.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;

It is not itself a data item: it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  is just a syntactic feature to close an indefinite-length item.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the "break" stop code appears anywhere where a data item is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  expected, other than directly inside an indefinite-length string,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  array, or map -- for example directly inside a definite-length array<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  or map -- the enclosing item is not well-formed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>I was wondering whether it would be helpful to clarify that by indefinite-length string it means text or byte string?&nbsp; Although this becomes clear in section 3.2.3 anyway ...&nbsp; My thinking is that section 3.2 lists 4 types that can have indefinite length, and then in this section both types are string are treated together. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2.3.&nbsp; Indefinite-Length Byte Strings and Text Strings<br><br>Would it be helpful to clarify that the chunks must be the same type.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;  consider what to do in those cases.&nbsp; The following non-normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  advice deals with these by converting them to a single substitute<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

~n can then be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  expressed as (-1)^n for the negative case, while 0^n leaves n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  unchanged for non-negative.&nbsp; The sign of a number can be converted to<br>&nbsp;

 A CBOR-based protocol MUST specify which of these options its<br>&nbsp;  decoders take, for each kind of invalid item they might encounter.<br><br>Are the lists of types of validity error presented in the following<br>subsections exhaustive for the respective data models?&nbsp; If so, it might<br>be worth mentioning that explicitly.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; It can report an error (and not return data).&nbsp; Note that this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; error is not a validity error per se.&nbsp; This kind of error is more<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; likely to be raised by a decoder that would be performing validity<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; checking if this were a known case.<br><br>(soapbox) Could we maybe be a little less encouraging of this behavior?<br>I am remembering horror stories of TLS stacks that did this for<br>extension types, which is an interoperability nightmare.&nbsp; I recognize<br>that there are cases where it is the desired behavior, but in the<br>general case tags are an extensibility point and we shouldn't encourage<br>that joint to rust shut.<br><br>Section 5.6.1<br><br>&nbsp;  As discussed in Section 2.2, specific data models can make values<br>&nbsp;  equivalent for the purpose of comparing map keys that are distinct in<br>&nbsp;  the generic data model.&nbsp; Note that this implies that a generic<br>&nbsp;  decoder may deliver a decoded map to an application that needs to be<br>&nbsp;  checked for duplicate map keys by that application (alternatively,<br>&nbsp;  the decoder may provide a programming interface to perform this<br>&nbsp;  service for the application).&nbsp; Specific data models cannot<br>&nbsp;  distinguish values for map keys that are equal for this purpose at<br>&nbsp;  the generic data model level.<br><br>This last bit seems like something that is forbidden by the protocol (vs<br>"cannot"); I wonder if a slight rewording is in order.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Numbers with fractional parts are represented as floating-point<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; values, performing the decimal-to-binary conversion based on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; precision provided by IEEE 754 binary64.&nbsp; Then, when encoding in<br><br>I forget if this conversion requires round-to-nearest or if multiple<br>rounding modes are available (the latter would of course be problematic<br>if we proceed on to the "can be represented in smaller float without<br>changing value" step).<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  The notation borrows the JSON syntax for numbers (integer and<br>&nbsp;  floating-point), True (&gt;true&lt;), False (&gt;false&lt;), Null (&gt;null&lt;), UTF-8<br><br>(soapbox) Is literal '&gt;' and '&lt;' really the best quoting strategy here<br>(and later on)?<br><br>Section 9.1, 9.2<br><br>What guidance can we give to the experts?<br><br>Section 9.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Applications that use this media type:&nbsp; None yet, but it is expected<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that this format will be deployed in protocols and applications.<br><br>I don't believe this to be currently accurate.<br><br>&nbsp;  Additional information:&nbsp; *&nbsp; Magic number(s): n/a<br><br>I guess 0xd9d9f7 doesn't count, then?<br><br>Section 9.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The CoAP Content-Format for CBOR is defined in<br>&nbsp;  [IANA.core-parameters]:<br><br>Is "defined in" the right way to word this?<br><br>Section 10<br><br>I guess the attack where you use indefinite-length encoding to achieve<br>total 'n' greater than 2**64 is not really practical at present...<br><br>Please add a mention of the risks of mixing a constrained decoder with a<br>variant (non-preferred-serialization) encoder, as alluded to in Section<br>4.1.<br><br>I also mention this down in G.3, but there seem to be some relevant<br>considerations regarding whether/when bignums and integers of the same<br>value are considered to be equivalent, in particular that the situation<br>is different depending on the data model in use.&nbsp; This could probably<br>fit nicely into general discussion of handling the multiple possible<br>serializations of various data items.<br><br>I would consider (but am not sure if I would end up adding) a mention<br>that CBOR can convey time values, and thus that protocols using CBOR to<br>convey time values are likely to rely on a source of accurate time.<br><br>I might incorporate by reference the <a href="/doc/rfc4648/">RFC 4648</a> security considerations<br>since we talk about base64 in several places.<br><br>Protocols using CBOR text strings will likely have internationalization<br>considerations; whether CBOR itself should mention this is not entirely<br>clear to me.<br><br>The potential loss of (e.g., type) information when converting from CBOR<br>to JSON is probably worth a mention, noting that applications performing<br>such conversions should consider whether they are affected and/or it's<br>desired to include specific type information in the generated JSON.<br><br>&nbsp;  numbers may exceed linear effort.&nbsp; Also, some hash-table<br>&nbsp;  implementations that are used by decoders to build in-memory<br>&nbsp;  representations of maps can be attacked to spend quadratic effort,<br>&nbsp;  unless a secret key (see Section 7 of [SIPHASH]) or some other<br>&nbsp;  mitigation is employed.&nbsp; Such superlinear efforts can be exploited by<br><br>It seems likely that an alternate reference not behind a paywall would<br>be usable to make this point.<br><br>Section 11.2<br><br>Would not [PCRE] need to be normative (if that functionality remains,<br>per the DISCUSS)?<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>[I did not verify the examples.]<br><br>&nbsp;

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Internet Standard. This is the proper type of RFC, as CBOR has achieved a high degree of technical maturity and its implementations have obtained successful operational experience. This is indicated in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>It is worth noting the controversy about the text on how generic decoders handle duplicate map keys. While <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a> stated that decoders cannot prescribe a specific handling of duplicated map keys, except it might consider the map malformed, part of the working group wanted the document to state more precisely what the decoder should do, and possibly what the protocol using CBOR should do (e.g. use first entry). This was considered, but would have made existing implementation non-compliant with this specification. Consensus was difficult to call, but in the end some text was added to explain the different options (reject the map, accept the map including the duplicates, lose some entries) and give guidance to implementations on what is expected of the application in every one of these cases. (See section 5.6)<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There exist a significant number of implementations of this specification, see <a href="https://cbor.io/impls.html">https://cbor.io/impls.html</a> for a non-exhaustive list.<br>Several of the working group participants have provided continuous reviews to the document, and have agreed that the document is ready for publication.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Francesca Palombini is the Document Shepherd. Barry Leiba is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed this document several times during its lifetime, and believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Not particularly.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors are in full compliance with BCPs 78 and 79 and there is no known IPR directly related to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The working group consensus is solid. One issue has created more contention, and is reported in (2). <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Although some points were contentious (see above), noone has threatened an appeal or indicated extreme discontent.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>No nits were found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>No required formal review was needed for this revision.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are no downward normative references. There are 3 non-RFC normative references: ECMA262, IEEE754, and IEEE Std. 1003.1 (TIME_T).<br>IEEE 754 (now 2019 edition) is in a very high state of maturity.<br>The regular expression part referenced from ECMA 262 also is at the needed level of maturity (the document only references the approximate format as a tag validity criteria).<br>The UNIX ("Posix") time format described in IEEE Std. 1003.1 is also very stable and well-understood in the community.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>Yes, this document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a>. That is clearly stated in the title page, abstract and introduction.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations section is different from <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a> in the fact that it points to the registries that were created in <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a>. It additionally requires IANA to update the references of these existing registries to point to this specification. For one existing registry, the contact and change control have been updated. For the Tags Registry, the registration policy has changed, with consensus of the working group.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No new IANA registries have been created.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>No automated checks were performed.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The document does not contain any YANG module.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Internet Standard. This is the proper type of RFC, as CBOR has achieved a high degree of technical maturity and its implementations have obtained successful operational experience. This is indicated in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>It is worth noting the controversy about the text on how generic decoders handle duplicate map keys. While <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a> stated that decoders cannot prescribe a specific handling of duplicated map keys, except it might consider the map malformed, part of the working group wanted the document to state more precisely what the decoder should do, and possibly what the protocol using CBOR should do (e.g. use first entry). This was considered, but would have made existing implementation non-compliant with this specification. Consensus was difficult to call, but in the end some text was added to explain the different options (reject the map, accept the map including the duplicates, lose some entries) and give guidance to implementations on what is expected of the application in every one of these cases. (See section 5.6)<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There exist a significant number of implementations of this specification, see <a href="https://cbor.io/impls.html">https://cbor.io/impls.html</a> for a non-exhaustive list.<br>Several of the working group participants have provided continuous reviews to the document, and have agreed that the document is ready for publication.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Francesca Palombini is the Document Shepherd. Barry Leiba is the Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed this document several times during its lifetime, and believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Not particularly.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors are in full compliance with BCPs 78 and 79 and there is no known IPR directly related to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The working group consensus is solid. One issue has created more contention, and is reported in (2). <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Although some points were contentious (see above), noone has threatened an appeal or indicated extreme discontent.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There are no downward normative references. There are 3 non-RFC normative references: ECMA262, IEEE754, and IEEE Std. 1003.1 (TIME_T).<br>IEEE 754 (now 2019 edition) is in a very high state of maturity.<br>The regular expression part referenced from ECMA 262 also is at the needed level of maturity (the document only references the approximate format as a tag validity criteria).<br>The UNIX ("Posix") time format described in IEEE Std. 1003.1 is also very stable and well-understood in the community.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?

If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA considerations section is different from <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a> in the fact that it points to the registries that were created in <a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a>. It additionally requires IANA to update the references of these existing registries to point to this specification. For one existing registry, the contact and change control have been updated.
