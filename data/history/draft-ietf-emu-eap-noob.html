We don’t think we should say anything <br>&gt;that could lead to a programmer mistakenly reordering the bytes in the <br>&gt;hash output.<br><br>FP: But the fact that you talk about "leftmost" bytes means that you are already implying ordering. Talking about leftmost without talking about ordering seems imprecise. Maybe you want to talk about the 16 most significant bytes instead.</div></td>

I especially appreciate the strong feature<br>set that's been assembled.<br><br>In Section 3.5 we discuss a key derivation scheme and say to use the<br>one-step KDF from NIST SP 800-56Ar3 §5.8.2.1.&nbsp; In particular, this is<br>not the two-step (extract-then-expand) KDF of the following section<br>(§5.8.2.2).&nbsp; Since the (EC)DH shared secret Z is not uniformly random,<br>my understanding was that generally the two-step KDF was needed, since<br>the one-step KDF assumes that the input key is uniformly selected.&nbsp; I am<br>not balloting Discuss for this point because I assume it was considered<br>in the formal verification, but I would very much appreciate some<br>additional insight into this selection.<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The overall protocol starts with the Initial Exchange, which<br>&nbsp;  comprises four EAP request-response pairs.&nbsp; In the Initial Exchange,<br>&nbsp;  the server allocates an identifier to the peer, and the server and<br><br>Is this a DoS risk for state exhaustion on the server?<br><br>&nbsp;  The server MUST NOT repeat a successful OOB Step with the same peer<br>&nbsp;  except if the association with the peer is explicitly reset by the<br>&nbsp;  user or lost due to failure of the persistent storage in the server.<br>&nbsp;  More specifically, once the association has entered the Registered<br>&nbsp;  state, the server MUST NOT delete the association or go back to the<br>&nbsp;  ephemeral states 0..2 without explicit user approval.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This also looks like a DoS risk, if a malicious device/user completes<br>the OOB step then only deletes the association on the device (without<br>telling the server), then re-registers, deletes again, etc.&nbsp; The server<br>is required to maintain state without bound.<br><br>&nbsp;  However, it MUST NOT delete or merge redundant associations without<br>&nbsp;  user or application approval because EAP-NOOB internally has no<br>&nbsp;  secure way of verifying that the two peers are the same physical<br>&nbsp;  device.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>No way other than the registered cryptographic key that's used to<br>authenticate the Reconnect Exchange, that is?<br><br>&nbsp;  A special feature of the EAP-NOOB method is that the server is not<br>&nbsp;  assumed to have any a-priori knowledge of the peer.&nbsp; Therefore, the<br>&nbsp;  peer initially uses the generic identity string "<a href="mailto:noob@eap-noob.arpa">noob@eap-noob.arpa</a>"<br>&nbsp;  as its network access identifier (NAI).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This looks like codepoint squatting, since we haven't received an early<br>allocation of this entry in .arpa.<br><br>section 3.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  After receiving the EAP-Response/Identity message, the server sends<br>&nbsp;  the first EAP-NOOB request (Type=1) to the peer, which responds with<br>&nbsp;  the peer identifier (PeerId) and state (PeerState) in the range 0..3.<br>&nbsp;  However, the peer SHOULD omit the PeerId from the response (Type=1)<br>&nbsp;  when PeerState=0.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Why only SHOULD and not MUST?<br><br>Section 3.2.3<br><br>Can we give any guidance for how to set OobRetries?<br><br>Section 3.2.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the request, the server sends the NoobId<br>&nbsp;  value, which the peer uses to identify the exact OOB message received<br>&nbsp;  by the server.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This is the first time we mention the NoobId value, so some more<br>explanation or forward-reference seems in order.<br><br>&nbsp;  value.&nbsp; The recipient of an unrecognized NoobId indicates this with<br>&nbsp;  an error message (error code 2003, see Section 3.6.1), and the<br>&nbsp;  Completion Exchange ends in EAP-Failure.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I assume that the formal modeling has considered whether the specific<br>"bad NoobId" error code leads to an attack.<br><br>Section 3.2.5<br><br>SleepTime is sent in an unauthenticated EAP message, thus presents a DoS<br>vector due to forged very large values.&nbsp; In Section 3.3.2 we seem to<br>place an upper limit of 3600 seconds, which could mitigate this DoS<br>risk.&nbsp; I suggest mentioning the upper limit here.<br><br>Section 3.3.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Section 7.5 covers some<br>of this, but we might benefit from specifically using the phrase<br>"privacy considerations" and perhaps expounding slightly more.<br><br>&nbsp;  The inputs for computing the fingerprint and message authentication<br>&nbsp;  codes are the following:<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br><br>Did the formal verification include modeling of scenarios where the<br>initial NAI varied and NewNAI was not sent?<br><br>Also, was consideration given to using a "raw" transcript hash that<br>takes the literal messages exchanged, as opposed to subsetting certain<br>fields?&nbsp; This version seems to leave, e.g., SleepTime unprotected even<br>by post-facto authentication.<br><br>&nbsp;  The nonces (Ns, Np, Ns2, Np2, Noob) and the hash value (NoobId) MUST<br>&nbsp;  be base64url encoded [<a href="/doc/rfc4648/">RFC4648</a>] when they are used as input to the<br>&nbsp;  cryptographic functions H or HMAC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This part is somewhat surprising to me; I would have only expected the<br>base64url encoding to be used for in-band messages and not for<br>cryptographic inputs, espcially if we are mixing use of en- and de-coded<br>forms (the raw binary is used for the KDF procedure).<br><br>Section 3.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; The peer first compares the received MACs2 value with one it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  computed using the Kz stored in the persistent EAP-NOOB<br><br>I briefly attempted to think through some scenarios where a Kz is<br>compromised (either from the peer or the server), as always checking the<br>persistent Kz makes it easy for an attacker that knows Kz and has some<br>on-path presence to get an exchange accepted when the peer recommences<br>EAP.&nbsp; But it seems that an attacker in that position would generally be<br>able to impersonate the server regardless of what procedure we specify,<br>since Kz is the main thing that authenticates the reconnect exchange<br>anyway.&nbsp; So I don't think that we need to consider (e.g.) attempting to<br>confirm a new key prior to Kz, if one is present.<br><br>&nbsp;  Exchange ends in EAP-Success.&nbsp; When KeyingMode is 3, the server also<br>&nbsp;  updates Cryptosuitep and Kz in the persistent EAP-NOOB association.<br>&nbsp;  On the other hand, if the server finds that the values do not match,<br>&nbsp;  it sends an error message (error code 4001), and the Reconnect<br>&nbsp;  Exchange ends in EAP-Failure.<br><br>It's surprising to me that Kz is only updated for keying mode 3 -- I<br>would have expected it to always update.&nbsp; IIUC doing so would provide a<br>weak form of forward secrecy even for the non-ECDHE case, and my<br>intuition is that it would extend the safe usable lifetime for the key<br>material.<br><br>Section 3.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;

<a href="/doc/rfc8037/">RFC 8037</a> is what defines X25519 for JOSE.&nbsp; (Curve25519 itself is<br>not yet registered, though there is some work underway in or adjacent to<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lwig-curve-representations/">draft-ietf-lwig-curve-representations</a> to define ECSDA and NIST cofactor<br>ECDH on Curve25519.)<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Coverage: This implementation is the most up-to-date.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Version compatibility: Version 02 of the working group adopted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; draft is implemented<br><br>It's hard to square "most up-to-date" with only implementing version 02<br>(the other implementations claim 08 and 06)...though since this is<br>getting removed anyway it's rather moot.<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  or API.&nbsp; In this case, the server can reliably associate the peer<br>&nbsp;  device with the user account.&nbsp; Applications that make use of EAP-NOOB<br><br>I'd suggest dropping "reliably" here; there are some attack scenarios<br>that can arise when a registration is deliberately (or perhaps even as a<br>confused deputy?) made under the "wrong" account.<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  It is, however, not possible to exploit accidental delivery of the<br>&nbsp;  OOB message to the wrong device when the user makes an unexpected<br>&nbsp;  mistake.&nbsp; This is because the wrong peer device would not have<br>&nbsp;  prepared for the attack by performing the Initial Exchange with the<br>&nbsp;  server.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not entirely sure that I understand what's being said here.&nbsp; IIUC an<br>attacker could well try to perform an initial exchange in parallel with<br>the legitimate device, keyed on by perhaps some environmental factors,<br>observing the user at another device, etc.&nbsp; But the attack would only<br>succeed if it was actively claiming the PeerId of the legitimate device,<br>and the legitimate device would have some failed exchange(s) that might<br>be able to detect the attack.&nbsp; Just saying "would not have prepared"<br>doesn't really help me understand how much (or how little) risk there<br>is.<br><br>&nbsp;  After the device registration, an attacker could clone the device<br>&nbsp;  identity by copying the keys from the persistent EAP-NOOB association<br>&nbsp;  into another device.&nbsp; The attacker can be an outsider who gains<br>&nbsp;  access to the keys or the device owner who wants to have two devices<br>&nbsp;  matching the same registration.&nbsp; The cloning threats can be mitigated<br>&nbsp;  by creating the cryptographic keys and storing the persistent EAP-<br>&nbsp;  NOOB association on the peer device in a secure hardware component<br>&nbsp;  such as a trusted execution environment (TEE).&nbsp; Furthermore, remote<br>&nbsp;  attestation on the application level could provide assurance to the<br>&nbsp;  server that the device has not been cloned.<br><br>Please mention that doing a KeyingMode-3 reconnect would drop any cloned<br>devices from being able to associate as that identity.<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>&nbsp;  EAP-NOOB.&nbsp; The server SHOULD assign a random or pseudo-random PeerId<br>&nbsp;  to each new peer.&nbsp; It SHOULD NOT select the PeerId based on any peer<br>&nbsp;  characteristics that it may know, such as the peer's link-layer<br>&nbsp;  network address.<br><br>Should we say anything to prevent the server from re-using a PeerId<br>(which would be a natural thing to do if this SHOULD NOT is ignored)?<br><br>Section 7.6<br><br>&nbsp;  As an additional precaution, the EAP server and peer MUST check for<br>&nbsp;  downgrading attacks in the Reconnect Exchange as follows.&nbsp; As long as<br>&nbsp;  the server or peer saves any information about the other endpoint, it<br>&nbsp;  MUST also remember the previously negotiated cryptosuite and MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  accept renegotiation of any cryptosuite that is known to be weaker<br>&nbsp;  than the previous one, such as a deprecated cryptosuite.&nbsp; Determining<br>&nbsp;  the relative strength of the cryptosuites is out of scope and may be<br>&nbsp;  managed by implementations or by local policies at the peer and<br>&nbsp;  server.<br><br>There is no fundamental guarantee that the peer and server will use the<br>same ordering for relative strength of ciphersuites.&nbsp; This could in<br>theory lead to a situation where any attempt to change ciphersuite is<br>rejected by the other party, and the participants are stuck on a single<br>ciphersuite.&nbsp; However, it's not really clear that there would be<br>significant practical consequences if that actually happened.<br><br>Section 7.9<br><br>Looking through the security claims, it seems pretty clear that the<br>mutual nonces give replay protection for the Initial and Reconnect<br>exchanges, but I didn't immediately see what provided replay protection<br>for the Completion exchange.&nbsp; I suspect it's just the local state on<br>both parties that would not produce a state transition on the basis of a<br>replayed exchange, but please confirm.&nbsp; (It might be worth a brief<br>discussion in the document about how replay protection is attained,<br>though I could pretty easily be convinced that it's not worth it.)<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>Since we use it to specify by reference the content of a protocol field,<br>[EUI-48] may well be classified as normative.<br><br>I also don't think that <a href="/doc/rfc4266/">RFC 4266</a> is the right reference for URLs in<br>general.<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>What do the asterisks in the middle column in Figure 12 indicate?<br><br>Appendix B<br><br>&nbsp;

 While roaming, the device needs to identify the networks where the<br>&nbsp;  EAP-NOOB association can be used to gain network access.&nbsp; For 802.11<br>&nbsp;  access networks, the server MAY send a list of SSID strings in the<br>&nbsp;  ServerInfo field called either SSIDList or Base64SSIDList.&nbsp; The list<br><br>[This ServerInfo usage is prior to the roaming event, right?]<br><br>Appendix D<br><br>&nbsp;  server.&nbsp; The URL MUST specify the https protocol, so that there is a<br>&nbsp;

 The ServerInfo in this case includes a field called ServerUrl of the<br>&nbsp;  following format with RECOMMENDED length of 60 characters or less:<br><br>&nbsp;  https://[:]/[]<br><br>&nbsp;  To this, the peer appends the OOB message fields (PeerId, Noob, Hoob)<br>&nbsp;  as a query string.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>To be honest, this feels like a great time to use POST rather than GET<br>with query string<br><br>(side note) If I understand correctly, this would not have been<br>compatible with the previous version of <a href="/doc/bcp190/">BCP 190</a>, but a recent-ish update<br>makes it okay.<br><br>Appendix E<br><br>These examples all have the "Type" field first in the JSON object, but<br>generally the semantics of a JSON object are not dependent on the order<br>in which fields appear.&nbsp;

The<br>&nbsp;  Reconnect Exchange in EAP-NOOB provides forward secrecy only if both<br>&nbsp;  the server and peer send their fresh ECDHE keys.&nbsp; This allows both<br>&nbsp;  the server and the peer to limit the frequency of the costly<br>&nbsp;  computation that is required for forward secrecy.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>We should say something about the case where the peer reuses its ECDH<br>share but the server generates a fresh one.&nbsp; (Also, as mentioned<br>previously, the hash-forward scheme can provide some forward secrecy<br>without an ECDH exchange.)<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>&nbsp;
