In fact,&nbsp; the subregistries<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  have always used the word "Reference". After receiving the&nbsp; author's <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  request to add "Requester" to the subregistry to bring it in line with <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the parent registry, the decision was instead made to change "Requester" <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to "Reference" in the Information Elements registry and to rename that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  registry's "References" column "Additional Information". The confusion<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  was introduced by IANA when instead of telling the author to remove the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "Requester" column from the subregistry request, IANA told him<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to use "Additional Information" and "Reference", as if the request was <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  about a request registration in the IE registry. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The issue about the IANA request information was brought up during<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the IETF Last-Call.

These new types can be used, for example, to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  monitor MPLS control plane migrations from LDP to IS-IS (or OSPF)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Segment Routing. Other use cases are discussed in the document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document ran 7 versions before adoption by opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  No major points of contention were encountered during the call for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption based on -07, development, and WGLC.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that a first attempt to adopt the work was made right after the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption hum that occurred during the IETF#108 virtual meeting. That<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  call was not conclusive as there was few support at the time.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Prior to the adoption by opsawg, Thomas requested feedback from <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  various WGs:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; mpls wg: The main comment was related to the reference that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indicated in the IANA section (whether this should be this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document or the document that defines the actual mechanism). This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is fixed as the IANA registry has two columns (one of them is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hidden and has to be fixed, see below): "Requester" column and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "References" column.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; lsr wg: The main comment was a suggestion to add a value for BGP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefix-SID, which the author appropriately addressed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; spring wg: The main input was to consider separate values for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. No objection to proceed with publication in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Thomas implemented the required changes to take into account the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  feedback received from these WGs, including comments from opsawg. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  An early version of the document was reviewed by IE doctors, Paul<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Aitken and Andrew Feren.

Is this type of RFC indicated in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  This document requests publication as an Informational RFC. That is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  indicated on the header page.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The intended status is justified given that the document includes <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  informative use cases to illustrate the use of the new types <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and it does not include any normative statements. Moreover, the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  registration policy for the target IANA registry (MPLS label types) <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  is "Expert Review". <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that publishing this document as an RFC makes sense as <a href="/doc/rfc7012/">RFC 7012</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  says the following:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || "The specification of new MPLS label types MUST be published using a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||&nbsp; well-established and persistent publication medium."<br><br> (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  approved documents. The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document defines new IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) types to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  identify which traffic is being forwarded based upon which MPLS control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  plane protocol within a Segment Routing (SR) domain.&nbsp; To that aim, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the document registers four new types for the IPFIX mplsTopLabelType<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Information Element (#46): IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, and BGP MPLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SR extensions. These new types can be used, for example, to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  monitor MPLS control plane migrations from LDP to IS-IS (or OSPF)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Segment Routing. Other use cases are discussed in the document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document ran 7 versions before adoption by opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  No major points of contention were encountered during the call for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption based on -07, development, and WGLC.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that a first attempt to adopt the work was made right after the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption hum that occurred during the IETF#108 virtual meeting. That<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  call was not conclusive as there was few support at the time.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Prior to the adoption by opsawg, Thomas requested feedback from <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  various WGs:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; mpls wg: The main comment was related to the reference that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indicated in the IANA section (whether this should be this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document or the document that defines the actual mechanism). This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is fixed as the IANA registry has two columns (one of them is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hidden and has to be fixed, see below): "Requester" column and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "References" column.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; lsr wg: The main comment was a suggestion to add a value for BGP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefix-SID, which the author appropriately addressed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; spring wg: The main input was to consider separate values for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. No objection to proceed with publication in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Thomas implemented the required changes to take into account the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  feedback received from these WGs, including comments from opsawg. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  An early version of the document was reviewed by IE doctors, Paul<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Aitken and Andrew Feren. The review revealed that "Requester" column<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  is hidden in the IANA page; the content in "References" column should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be in "Requester" column and vice versa. As an outcome, the "References"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  column should be renamed to "Additional Information".&nbsp; Both IANA and IE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  doctors confirmed that IE46 registry will be fixed when making the actions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that are requested by this I-D. The table in the "IANA Considerations" <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Section of this document will be updated (by the author or RFC Editor) once<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the IANA registry is renamed from "References" to "Additional Information".<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document focuses on MPLS-SR; SRv6-specific IEs are defined in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-patki-srv6-ipfix">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-patki-srv6-ipfix</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document benefited from reviews from many WGs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  These reviews helped to enhance the quality of the document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Personnel:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The document shepherd is Mohamed Boucadair <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Responsible Area Director is Robert Wilton <br><br> (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the Document Shepherd.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  At least, two detailed reviews were made by the Document Shepherd: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * WGLC: <a href="https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-01-rev%20Med.pdf">https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-01-rev%20Med.pdf</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Shepherd Review: <a href="https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-02-rev%20Med.pdf">https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/draft-ietf-opsawg-ipfix-mpls-sr-label-type-02-rev%20Med.pdf</a> <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Also, the Document Shepherd shared comments for -07 as part of the WG<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Call for Adoption.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The author has taken into account these various reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  This version is ready for publication.<br><br> (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  No. <br><br> (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  broader perspective.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  No.<br><br> (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or the IESG should be aware of?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I used to have an issue with the Intended Status (Standards Track) of <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the document given that it does not include any normative statement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and the IANA registration policy does not require a Standards Track RFC.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  After discussion with the WG and the author, it was decided to change <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the intended status to Informational as part of the Shepherd review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have no concern with -05.<br><br> (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Yes. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The IPR response from the author can be seen at: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/opsawg/7m3sRo18BTmGwSC6RVBMoVB9LCg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/opsawg/7m3sRo18BTmGwSC6RVBMoVB9LCg/</a><br><br> (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  No.<br><br> (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?

Why<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  the title page header?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  This document requests publication as an Informational RFC. That is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  indicated on the header page.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The intended status is justified given that the document includes <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  informative use cases to illustrate the use of the new types <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  and it does not include any normative statements. Moreover, the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  registration policy for the target IANA registry (MPLS label types) <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  is "Expert Review". <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that publishing this document as an RFC makes sense as <a href="/doc/rfc7012/">RFC 7012</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  says the following:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; || "The specification of new MPLS label types MUST be published using a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||&nbsp; well-established and persistent publication medium."<br><br> (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  approved documents. The approval announcement contains the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  following sections:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Technical Summary:<br> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document defines new IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) types to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  identify which traffic is being forwarded based upon which MPLS control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  plane protocol within a Segment Routing (SR) domain.&nbsp; To that aim, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the document registers four new types for the IPFIX mplsTopLabelType<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Information Element (#46): IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, and BGP MPLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SR extensions. These new types can be used, for example, to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  monitor MPLS control plane migrations from LDP to IS-IS (or OSPF)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Segment Routing. Other use cases are discussed in the document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document ran 7 versions before adoption by opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  No major points of contention were encountered during the call for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption based on -07, development, and WGLC.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that a first attempt to adopt the work was made right after the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  adoption hum that occurred during the IETF#108 virtual meeting. That<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  call was not conclusive as there was few support at the time.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Prior to the adoption by opsawg, Thomas requested feedback from <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  various WGs:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; mpls wg: The main comment was related to the reference that is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indicated in the IANA section (whether this should be this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document or the document that defines the actual mechanism). This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is fixed as the IANA registry has two columns (one of them is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hidden and has to be fixed, see below): "Requester" column and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "References" column.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; lsr wg: The main comment was a suggestion to add a value for BGP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefix-SID, which the author appropriately addressed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; spring wg: The main input was to consider separate values for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. No objection to proceed with publication in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opsawg.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Thomas implemented the required changes to take into account the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  feedback received from these WGs, including comments from opsawg. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  An early version of the document was reviewed by IE doctors, Paul<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Aitken and Andrew Feren. The review revealed that "Requester" column<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  is hidden in the IANA page; the content in "References" column should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be in "Requester" column and vice versa. As an outcome, the "References"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  column should be renamed to "Additional Information".&nbsp; Both IANA and IE<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  doctors confirmed that IE46 registry will be fixed when making the actions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that are requested by this I-D.
