Does that make any difference<br>to the applicability statement?&nbsp; (Funny that the shepherd<br>write up says this passes the nit checker but the nit<br>checker in the tracker spots this and the ESP one below.)<br><br>- 1.3: Should the section title be "Background"? <br><br>- 3.6: I didn't know what Spec(T) meant. Maybe add a<br>reference to 3324 section 2.4?<br><br>- section 5: By "domain name" do you mean it has to be, or<br>just often is, a real DNS name? <br><br>- section 7: Does that syntax allow for i18n?<br><br>- section 8: <a href="/doc/rfc2406/">RFC 2406</a> is obsoleted. That should be fixed.<br><br>- section 8: Don't you want to allow SIP/TLS too?<br><br>- section 8, para 1: Using "ensures the ..." is somewhat<br>optimistic isn't it? "needs to ensure the ..." would be<br>better I think.<br><br>- section 8: Also just wondering. Given that this header<br>field name is quite long and assuming for a moment that it<br>might be the only difference between private and public SIP<br>messages, might not the message sizes allow someone to<br>distinguish such SIP messages even if they are encrypted?<br>Worth noting? I'm not sure, but the example you give is 42<br>bytes long which could be a nice distinguisher if one<br>cared.</div></td>

So, this paragraph would have been about right in 2008, but it doesn't describe reality today.<br><br>I'm fine with publishing this specification for a P-header because it's documenting established practice, and section 1.3 of the draft explains that, but I'd prefer that we not publish an RFC in 2014 that seems to say the draft authors were bound by <a href="/doc/rfc3427/">RFC 3427</a> requirements that no longer apply.<br><br>There are, of course, other ways to address this comment, but chopping the first paragraph in 1.2 would work for me.<br><br>In this text: 8.&nbsp; Security considerations<br><br>&nbsp;  The private network indication defined in this document MUST only be<br>&nbsp;  used in the traffics transported between the elements which are<br>&nbsp;  mutually trusted.&nbsp; Traffic protection between network elements can be<br>&nbsp;  achieved by using the security protocols such as IPsec ESP [<a href="/doc/rfc2406/">RFC2406</a>]<br>&nbsp;  or sometimes by physical protection of the network.&nbsp; <br><br>(I swear this isn't a post-Snowden question) <br><br>This draft was Publication-Requested in its current form because it matches existing deployments, if I'm understanding correctly.

The approval announcement contains the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; following sections:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technical Summary:<br><br>This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header<br>used by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).&nbsp; The<br>P-Private-Network-Indication indicates that the message is part of<br>the message traffic of a private network, and identifies that private<br>network.&nbsp; A private network indication allows nodes to treat private<br>network traffic according to a different set of rules than the set<br>applicable to public network traffic.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Working Group Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was the document considered in any WG, and if so, why was<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it not adopted as a work item there? Was there controversy<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about particular points that caused the WG to not adopt the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document?<br>&nbsp; <br>This document has been discussed in the DISPATCH WG.&nbsp; The DISPATCH WG does not progress any documents as WG documents.&nbsp; The DISPATCH WG selects one the following actions for contributions to the WG that have been adequately reviewed and discussed:<br>- None in the case of work items for which there is inadequate interest or feedback indicates that the work should not be progressed (e.g., it's a bad idea or not within scope for RAI area or IETF)<br>- New work item in currently chartered WG<br>- New WG or mini-WG in the case where the deliverable is likely a single document - e.g. a new SIP header<br>- IETF official BoF - typically for work items that are of broad interest and potential impact within the RAI area and across areas.<br>- Individual/AD sponsored - for items limited in scope and applicability<br><br>Individual/AD sponsored was the consensus of the DISPATCH WG for this document and the AD(s) agreed to progress the document.&nbsp; There was no controversy around this decision.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Document Quality<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>This document is required for the 3GPP/IMS specifications, thus any vendor that implements the 3GPP specifications follows this specification.&nbsp; <br>John Elwell thoroughly reviewed earlier versions of this document. In addition, James Yu provided a detailed review and Paul Kyzivat reviewed one of the more recent versions.&nbsp; <br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Personnel<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Who is the Document Shepherd?

For example, perhaps he or <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; event, if the interested community has discussed those issues <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; detail those concerns here.<br><br>There are no specific concerns or issues. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; individuals, with others being silent, or does the interested <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; community as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There is WG consensus that AD sponsored is the best approach for progressing this document. No one has expressed concerns about its progression.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  publicly available.) <br><br>No. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  document.
