Are there any considerations for the statistics collected, can they be used in a malicious way?&nbsp; I would think so and that this would be an important security consideration.&nbsp; Mentioning possible issues would be helpful to the reader.<br><br>- Thanks for adding in text about this one!<br><br>3. Section 6<br>Reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a> isn't enough for the security considerations of HTTP since that's a really old RFC.&nbsp; If you want authentication options, you could point to the HTTPAuth documents, which include updated versions of HTTP basic (<a href="/doc/rfc7616/">RFC7616</a>) and digest (<a href="/doc/rfc7617/">RFC7617</a>).&nbsp; While there are still lots of security issues with these options, the RFCs spell out what the actual considerations are, which are helpful to the reader.&nbsp; This raises the need for TLS 1.2 as well to provide session protection for the session (passive and active attacks) as well as for the authentication used.<br><br>You mention HTTPAuth's digest in 6.1, but there's no reference.&nbsp; This is a little better, so I am moving this to a comment from discuss.<br><br>4. Section 6.1<br>Why isn't TLS a must here to protect the session data?<br>If you are relying on OAuth Bearer tokens, they offer no security protection without TLS, so to rely on this, I'd say TLS really should be a MUST.&nbsp; The authentication types to get a bearer token (at least in RFC documentation and in the registry) are all pretty weak and require TLS protection to have any level of security.<br><br>With the TLS MUST, we are recommending TLS 1.2 as the minimum in drafts.&nbsp; It would be good to see a mention of TLS 1.2 as a minimum recommendation and a reference to the BCP for TLS 1.2 configurations <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a> (it even includes cipher suite recommendations).<br><br>- Thanks for adding in the MUST for TLS and the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a>.<br><br>5. Privacy<br>I would have expected some discussion on the protection of the 2 ID types and the tracker capabilities and that session encryption (TLS) ought to be used when this is a consideration.&nbsp; Is there a reason this isn't covered?&nbsp; If it's not a concern, I'd like to understand why.<br><br>-Thanks for adding in a privacy section!</div></td>

I'm clearing the discuss under the assumption the proposed text will make it into the next revision.<br><br>- 1.1, definitions of "LEECH" and "SEEDER"<br><br>These don't seem to match the&nbsp; use of the terms elsewhere in the document. In particular, these seems to describe transient states, while the protocol requires the peer to declare itself to be a leech or seed when it joins a swarm. Additionally, these definitions don't seem to consider a peer that may have received part but not all of some content, but still makes the chunks it has available.<br><br>- 1.1, LIVE STREAMING:<br><br>Is there an expectation of syncing reception between receivers? <br><br>- 1.1, VIDEO-ON-DEMAND<br>Aren't the main points that different audiences can watch the same part at different times, or different parts at the same time?<br><br>- 1.2, 2nd to last paragraph:<br><br>Wouldn't a distributed tracker have implications for discover and connection management? It also seems worth some discussion in the operations section.<br><br>- 1.2.2, first paragraph:<br><br>Aren't there at least some implied requirements for peer-ids? E.g. uniqueness requirements? Requirements for elements to treat them as opaque strings?<br><br>-2.1: "The messaging model of PPSP-TP aligns with HTTP protocol..."<br><br>Is that the same as saying it uses HTTP as a substrate? (If so, the references to HTTP need to be normative.)<br><br>- 2.2, 3rd paragraph: "Requests are sent, and responses returned to these requests."<br>The use of passive voice obscures the actors. What does each of these things?<br><br>- Figure 5: Is there a matching peer state machine (i.e. that models the internal state of a peer?)<br><br>- 2.3.2, general:<br><br>The section is inconsistent in specifying result codes. Also, it's not clear whether these are HTTP result codes, or PPSP-TP result codes.<br><br>-2.3.2: "Peers MUST NOT generate protocol elements that are invalid."<br><br>That's an odd use of "MUST NOT". <br><br>ability_nat: What's the use case for one peer caring what the NAT status of other peers might be, as long as it gets addresses that it can reach?<br><br>- 3.2.4: "connection":<br>That list will continuously become obsolete. I suggest some classification that describes the attributes you care about, rather than the current-as-of-now set of network technologies.<br><br>- table 3:<br><br>How is "priority" encoded and interpreted?<br><br>-3.3.4:<br><br>"Normally, swarm action result<br>&nbsp;  elements SHOULD be set and error_code MUST be set to 0 when<br>&nbsp;  response_type is 0x00."<br><br>What does it mean for swarm action results element to be set? Since that's a structure, I assume you don't mean set as in "true", or set to zero like the error_code. Do you mean they should be _included_ or _present_?<br><br>"A swarm action result element is the result information for a peer to<br>&nbsp;  request the tracker to have some actions towards the swarm."<br><br>I'm a bit confused about the causality here. This is the result of a request that has already happened? An indication that the pier should request something? A reciprocal request and the result of the previous request?<br><br>-4, general:<br><br>The protocol specification sections are inconsistent in the way they use 2119 keywords. It seems somewhat random whether any given protocol requirement uses 2119 keywords or not. I suggest the authors re-review this section for 2119 consistency. In general, you don't need 2119 words to describe every detail of the the basic flow of the protocol; rather they are more useful when there's a decision to make, or a place where an implementor is likely to get things wrong.<br><br>-4, 2nd paragraph:<br><br>Can you offer any guidance on when one should actually _use_ HTTPS? (See DISCUSS comment)<br><br>-4, paragraph 4:<br><br>This seems to be describing the general working of HTTP. I'm not sure why you need to restated it here, especially with 2119 words.<br><br>-4.1.1, paragraph 4:<br><br>Since the mentioned elements are "optional", is there any guidance for the tracker? For example, can the peer assume that the tracker (or other peers) will never require these elements to operate properly? Or if they may be required by the tracker (or other peers), how would the peer know it needed to include them?<br><br>- 4.1.1, paragraph 6:<br><br>"... MAY... start by pre-processing the peer authentication information" needs elaboration. I assume the "MAY" relates to the previously mentioned "preferred" use of TLS client certificate authentication?<br><br>-4.1.1., 3 paragraphs from end:<br><br>Can you elaborate on "STUN-like function"? I gather the tracker can reflect back the observed source address/port of the peer in the response? If so, I'm not sure readers will understand that from "STUN-like function".<br><br>-4.1.1.1:<br><br>I'd love to see the example use HTTPS, just to set a good example.<br><br>In the example of a peer leaving one swarm and joining another, second swarm_action:<br><br>s/@peer_mode/peer_mode<br><br>-4.3, 1st paragraph:<br><br>Why would the peer fail to read the response? Because the response is invalid? Not received? This all runs over TCP right?<br><br>-4.3, 3rd paragraph:<br><br>Why only a should? What are the consequences of not being prepared?<br><br>I assume the errors in this section are PPSP-TP errors, not HTTP result codes. I think the choice of 4XX codes will confuse people into thinking these match the HTTP 4XX client-error result codes. Especially since many seem to have similar meanings--but rearranged.<br><br>-6.1:<br><br>It would probably be worth mentioning the need for an enrollment service in the operations section.<br><br>The 3rd paragraph would work better in the previous paragraph where you mention the HTTP security considerations, and perhaps cast in terms of HTTPS. Also, please consider a reference to <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC 7525</a>.<br><br><br>OAuth might should've been mentioned back when you discussed digest authentication and HTTPS client certificates <br><br>-6.2:<br><br>This seems to mean that the peers in a swarm must agree on an integrity protection mechanism. Can you reference something? On the other hand isn't this an issue for the actual transport protocol rather than the tracker protocol?<br><br>-7:<br><br>The 3rd paragraph seems to forbid adding new elements, as described in the next section.<br><br>The 2119 words in the 4th paragraph are questionable. It's hard to put MUST level requirements on people, and the MAY is a statement of fact.<br><br>In the last two paragraphs:<br><br>Internet-Drafts are not appropriate places to document things, other than ephemerally on their ways to become RFCs. I-Ds expire. <br><br>Saying extensions MAY be documented in RFCs doesn't add anything; anything may be documented in RFCs. I assume therefore you mean at least SHOULD. If so, what kind(s) of RFCs would be appropriate?<br><br>The suggestion that private extensions need not be documented in RFCs can be harmful to long-term interoperability. So-called private extensions have a way of migrating to public networks.<br><br>-7.2:<br><br>Wouldn't non-backward compatible extensions require a new version number? Doesn't this violate the requirements in the parent section?<br><br>-8:<br><br>I am surprised not to see registries for methods and result codes, especially with the considerable text about extensibility. Do you expect them to be extended?<br><br>10.2:<br>The references to 2616, 2818,&nbsp; and 5246 probably need to be normative. Also, 2616 is obsolete.<br><br>Editorial and nits:<br>-------------------<br><br>- IDNits points out a number of citations without matching references<br><br>-1.1: VIDEO-ON-DEMAND and LIVE-STREAMING<br><br>I suggest changing "It refers to" to "VIDEO-ON-DEMAND refers to..." and "LIVE-STREAMING refers to..."<br><br>- 2.2, definition of CONNECT: "... Peer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registers in the Tracker (or if already registered) to notify it..."<br><br>What is the antecedent of "it"? (peer or tracker?)<br><br>- 2.3.1, 4): <br>s/"is responded with"/ "is responded to with" (Or even better, "The tracker responds to the request with...")<br><br>- 3.1 : "... turning the definitions for<br>&nbsp;  JSON objects extensible."<br><br>I don't understand the phrase. Do you mean "making the definitions...extensible"?<br><br>- 3.2.2, 1st paragraph:<br><br>Paragraph seems out of place, and seems redundant with the rest of the section. The placement here makes it look like NAT status selection is the primary use, and I don't think that's the intent.<br><br>s/"inform the tracker on the preferred type"/"inform the tracker of the preferred type"<br><br>- 3.2.5, first paragraph:<br><br>s/can be related with/can be related to<br><br>-3.3.4, response element:<br><br>s/ppsp_tp_interger_t/ppsp_tp_integer_t<br><br>- 4.1.1, 3rd paragraph after table 6<br><br>The first sentence is convoluted and hard to parse. I suggest breaking it into simpler sentences.<br><br><br>-4.1.2, 4th paragraph, "... with regard to the possibility of<br>&nbsp;  connecting with other IETF efforts such as ALTO [<a href="/doc/rfc7285/">RFC7285</a>]."<br><br>I don't understand the intent of this phrase.<br><br>-4.1.2, 5th paragraph:<br><br>The structure of the sentence is confusing. Do you mean to say that included elements MUST include public addresses?<br><br>-4.1.2, 3rd to last paragraph:<br><br>The paragraph seems redundant to the previous paragraph.<br><br>-6, first paragraph:<br><br>s/"impersonating to be another valid participant"/"impersonate a valid participant"<br><br>-7.2, security issues: "Being security an important component of any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; protocol..."<br><br>I don't understand this phrase.</div></td>

Section 5.2.7<br>Please make mention and reference to security provisions for SNMP and Syslog.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5424/">RFC5424</a> is just for syslog, so a pointer for SNMP security considerations should be added in this section as well.&nbsp; They use a boilerplate for the text and add considerations specific to a draft.&nbsp;  Benoit - do you have a good reference for them to use?&nbsp; A more generic SNMP draft might not be up-to-date with the latest boilerplate text.&nbsp; If that's the case, the recent changes are small and could be stated with a pointer to an RFC with the older boilerplate text.<br><br>2. Are there any considerations for the statistics collected, can they be used in a malicious way?&nbsp; I would think so and that this would be an important security consideration.&nbsp; Mentioning possible issues would be helpful to the reader.<br><br>Section 6<br>Reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a> isn't enough for the security considerations of HTTP since that's a really old RFC.&nbsp; If you want authentication options, you could point to the HTTPAuth documents, which include updated versions of HTTP basic (<a href="/doc/rfc7616/">RFC7616</a>) and digest (<a href="/doc/rfc7617/">RFC7617</a>).&nbsp; While there are still lots of security issues with these options, the RFCs spell out what the actual considerations are, which are helpful to the reader.&nbsp; This raises the need for TLS 1.2 as well to provide session protection for the session (passive and active attacks) as well as for the authentication used.<br><br>Section 6.1<br>Why isn't TLS a must here to protect the session data?<br>If you are relying on OAuth Bearer tokens, they offer no security protection without TLS, so to rely on this, I'd say TLS really should be a MUST.&nbsp; The authentication types to get a bearer token (at least in RFC documentation and in the registry) are all pretty weak and require TLS protection to have any level of security.<br><br>With the TLS MUST, we are recommending TLS 1.2 as the minimum in drafts.&nbsp; It would be good to see a mention of TLS 1.2 as a minimum recommendation and a reference to the BCP for TLS 1.2 configurations <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a> (it even includes cipher suite recommendations).<br><br>Privacy<br>I would have expected some discussion on the protection of the 2 ID types and the tracker capabilities and that session encryption (TLS) ought to be used when this is a consideration.&nbsp; Is there a reason this isn't covered?&nbsp; If it's not a concern, I'd like to understand why.</div></td>

Or is this sentence referring to the registry in Section 8.2?

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>This document describes protocol specification. So it is Proposed Standard, as indicated in the front page.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>This document specifies the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol Tracker Protocol (PPSP-TP), an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers. The specification outlines the architecture of the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows, message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and semantics.&nbsp; The PPSP-TP enables cooperating peers to form content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time Structured Media content delivery (audio, video, associated timed text and metadata).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>There was debate on the encoding of the protocol messages, particularly on text-based versus binary-based. Rough consensus was finally made that using text-based encoding as mandatory encoding scheme.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>There is at least one implementation of PPSP-TP, as described in another PPSP Usage I-D. The document itself should have good quality, based on several rounds of expertise review conducted within PPSP group.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document shepherd is Ning Zong. Responsible AD is Martin Stiemerling<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>The document should be ready for publication, after several rounds of expertise review conducted within PPSP group.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No concern.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>Some JSON encoding examples may need broader review from JSON experts.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No concern.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>No IPR disclosure yet.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No IPR disclosure yet.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>WG consensus represents a strong agreement among a few individuals.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>Checked, and no error found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No such review required.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No such normative reference.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No such normative reference.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No change to existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>New registry for media type in HTTP/1.1 header is proposed, as part of PPSP-TP encoding scheme.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>No.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br></div></td>
