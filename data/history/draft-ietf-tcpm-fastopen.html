This consumes two<br>bytes of very scarce 40B option space in TCP SYN segments, which could<br>thus prevent other, future TCP extensions. Right now, there is no<br>significant shortage of IANA-assigned TCP option codepoints for users<br>following the IETF process: Out of 256 codepoints, IANA has only 14<br>codepoints assigned to an non-obsoleted RFC, 6 other registrations<br>(legacy), 9 obsoleted codepoints, and of the order of 10-15 known<br>unauthorized uses. Given the benefits and the deployment of this<br>protocol on the one hand side, and the large number of unallocated and<br>available TCP option codepoints on the other hand, use of a dedicated<br>option codepoint is considered to be the right trade-off.

TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets<br>&nbsp;  and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection<br>&nbsp;  handshake, thus saving up to one full round trip time (RTT)<br>&nbsp;  compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake<br>&nbsp;  (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However TFO<br>&nbsp;  deviates from the standard TCP semantics since the data in the SYN<br>&nbsp;  could be replayed to an application in some rare<br>&nbsp;  circumstances.

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The TCPM working group decided with strong consensus to ask for IANA allocation of a TCP option number for this experimental document.<br><br>Reasoning: The protocol has always followed the guidelines of <a href="/doc/rfc6994/">RFC 6994</a> and it currently uses an experimental TCP option number in combination with a registered experimental identifier (0xF989). This consumes two bytes of very scarce 40B option space in TCP SYN segments, which could thus prevent other, future TCP extensions. Right now, there is no significant shortage of IANA-assigned TCP option codepoints for users following the IETF process: Out of 256 codepoints, IANA has only 14 codepoints assigned to an non-obsoleted RFC, 6 other registrations (legacy), 9 obsoleted codepoints, and of the order of 10-15 known unauthorized uses. Given the benefits and the deployment of this protocol on the one hand side, and the large number of unallocated and available TCP option codepoints on the other hand, use of a dedicated option codepoint is considered to be the right trade-off. The TCPM working group therefore asks the IESG for approving a TCP option codepoint allocation for this experimental document. <br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>Not applicable<br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>Not applicable<br></div></td>
