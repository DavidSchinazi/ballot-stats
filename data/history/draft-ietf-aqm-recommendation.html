That is, the document's explicit recommendation for algorithms to be able to operate in a transport- and application-agnostic fashion is a privacy-enhancing feature.<br><br>-- Sec 9:<br>I'm a little surprised that almost all of the research referenced in this document is from the 1990s, given recent attention that has been paid to this topic.</div></td>

I'm bemused by the use of <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> as the reference for TCP later in this document, since <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> TCP behaves nothing like TCP as characterized here. <br><br>I know I'm confused by the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc768/">RFC 768</a> - that's UDP, as cited correctly elsewhere in the document.<br><br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; Non-Responsive Flows<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [<a href="/doc/rfc768/">RFC0768</a>] provides a minimal,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  best-effort transport to applications and upper-layer protocols<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (both simply called "applications" in the remainder of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  document) and does not itself provide mechanisms to prevent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  congestion collapse and establish a degree of fairness [<a href="/doc/rfc5405/">RFC5405</a>].<br><br>I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that non-responsive flows use UDP transport (especially in our tunneled world). If you guys think this is OK, I'll hold my nose, but if you wanted to say anything about "other flows that are as non-responsive as UDP transport", I'd think that would be helpful. <br><br>It certainly fits at least as well as the "large number of short-lived TCP flows that are much less responsive" paragraph that you end this section with, which probably fits better under the following list item, <br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; Transport Flows that are less responsive than TCP<br>&nbsp;  <br>In this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  It is essential that all Internet hosts respond to loss [<a href="/doc/rfc5681/">RFC5681</a>],<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5405/">RFC5405</a>][<a href="/doc/rfc4960/">RFC4960</a>][<a href="/doc/rfc4340/">RFC4340</a>].&nbsp; Packet dropping by network devices that<br>&nbsp;  are under load has two effects: It protects the network, which is the<br>&nbsp;  primary reason that network devices drop packets.&nbsp; The detection of<br>&nbsp;  loss also provides a signal to a reliable transport (e.g.&nbsp; TCP, SCTP)<br>&nbsp;  that there is potential congestion using a pragmatic heuristic; "when<br>&nbsp;  the network discards a message in flight, it may imply the presence<br>&nbsp;  of faulty equipment or media in a path, and it may imply the presence<br>&nbsp;  of congestion.&nbsp; To be conservative, a transport must assume it may be<br>&nbsp;  the latter."&nbsp; Unreliable transports (e.g. using UDP) need to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  similarly react to loss [<a href="/doc/rfc5405/">RFC5405</a>]<br>&nbsp;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>&nbsp;  <br>would it be more correct to say "Applications using unreliable transports (e.g. UDP)"?</div></td>

We did ask the IRTF <br>if there is any issue to update their document and we got the feedback that the <br>IETF should go ahead.

Recent examples can be <br>found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval <br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document is a complete rework of the recommendations to have some form of <br>active queue management in ideally every queue. While <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> (1998) was mostly <br>concerned around network stability, and made recommendations which did not <br>appeal to operators (universal deployment of RED, which has been found to be <br>particularly hard to configure correctly), this revised document includes the <br>lessons learned over the past years. Also, the main focus is on reducing network <br>latency, while still delivering improvements to network stability. It contains<br>a number of requirements, that a modern AQM mechanism should fulfill, without<br>endorsing one specific method.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There was consensus early on about the aim and technical content of this <br>document. However, specific wording (e.g. carrying over text from <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a>, as <br>this document started off as a 2309bis draft) was objected to.<br><br>Also, the question if this document should update or obsolete the earlier BCP <br>(which was the result of discussions on the end2end mailing list, prior of <br>formation of the IRTF) has been disussed eagerly.<br><br>On the technical grounds to argue for obsoleting the earlier BCP, this document <br>specifically deprecates RED in favor of one of potentially several more modern <br>AQM algorithms. Further, a point has been made that since it is not necessary to <br>read <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> to arrive at a sound understanding of the IETF (WG) consensus <br>position around AQM, and the deviation is large enough with little overlap, having <br>this document update 2309 was deemed less appropriate than obsoleting it.<br><br>Finally, one active participant has expressed very strong objections to some of <br>the points summarized above, but later commented that he will accept his <br>position as "in the rough". So, even though this was voiced at one point in <br>time, an appeal is not expected.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>As a BCP, a number of operators and developers are following up on the updated <br>recommendations. Newer mechanisms that fulfill the updated requirements have <br>been developed by multiple parties and are already being deployed by third <br>parties (e.g. DOCSIS PIE in Cable Modems). <br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the <br>specification? <br><br>Yes; As a recommendation, it provides the necessary guidance when mechanisms are <br>developed. Also, interoperability between AQMs is not as strict as in other <br>areas, as many variants can be deployed along a path, as long as some over-<br>arching design principles are adhered to.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough <br>review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the <br>document had no substantive issues? <br><br>John Leslie and Bob Briscoe made comments that improved the overall document <br>text, to align with the technical aim. However, these changes did not modify the <br>technical content.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>Richard Scheffenegger, AQM WG co-chair<br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Martin Stiemerling, Transport AD<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd.

Both technical and <br>wording have been honed, as witnessed also by the sheperd. There are no unresolved<br>issues which would preclude this from being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No; some discussions lately deviated from the document itself, and were rather <br>procedural in content (e.g. update / obsolete / new BCP).<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No; However, the document touches work that is done in other standards bodies <br>such as IEEE, CableLabs, WFA, 3GPP, ITU. Participants in those organisations <br>were part of the discussions and active feedback was also provided (e.g. DOCSIS-<br>PIE)<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with <br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware <br>of? <br><br>A substancial part of the document was updated during WGLC on the insistence of <br>one WG member; As they don't touch the main content, review of these sections <br>(2-4) by the WG has been more limited.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>already been filed.

If so, <br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the <br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is strong concensus on the document, with very few individuals disagreeing <br>with some of the text. However, that disagreement does not appear to be about <br>the technical parts. [[Check for -07]]<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this <br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>This point has been discussed in confidence with the responsible AD. <br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If such normative references <br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, <br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call <br>procedure.<br><br>There are no downref references at the time of this writeup.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and <br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and <br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the <br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this <br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>Yes; former BCP <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> will be obsoleted, as the guidance given herein is <br>complete and self-contained.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, <br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm <br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the <br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA <br>registries have been clearly identified.

However, specific wording (e.g. carrying over text from <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a>, as <br>this document started off as a 2309bis draft) was objected to.<br><br>Also, the question if this document should update or obsolete the earlier BCP <br>(which was the result of discussions on the end2end mailing list, prior of <br>formation of the IRTF) has been disussed eagerly.<br><br>On the technical grounds to argue for obsoleting the earlier BCP, this document <br>specifically deprecates RED in favor of one of potentially several more modern <br>AQM algorithms. Further, a point has been made that since it is not necessary to <br>read <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> to arrive at a sound understanding of the IETF (WG) consensus <br>position around AQM, and the deviation is large enough with little overlap, having <br>this document update 2309 was deemed less appropriate than obsoleting it.<br><br>Finally, one active participant has expressed very strong objections to some of <br>the points summarized above, but later commented that he will accept his <br>position as "in the rough". So, even though this was voiced at one point in <br>time, an appeal is not expected.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>As a BCP, a number of operators and developers are following up on the updated <br>recommendations. Newer mechanisms that fulfill the updated requirements have <br>been developed by multiple parties and are already being deployed by third <br>parties (e.g. DOCSIS PIE in Cable Modems). <br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the <br>specification? <br><br>Yes; As a recommendation, it provides the necessary guidance when mechanisms are <br>developed. Also, interoperability between AQMs is not as strict as in other <br>areas, as many variants can be deployed along a path, as long as some over-<br>arching design principles are adhered to.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough <br>review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the <br>document had no substantive issues? <br><br>John Leslie and Bob Briscoe made comments that improved the overall document <br>text, to align with the technical aim. However, these changes did not modify the <br>technical content.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>Richard Scheffenegger, AQM WG co-chair<br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Martin Stiemerling, Transport AD<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, <br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The document had thorough discussions in the WG sessions. Both technical and <br>wording have been honed, as witnessed also by the sheperd. There are no unresolved<br>issues which would preclude this from being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No; some discussions lately deviated from the document itself, and were rather <br>procedural in content (e.g. update / obsolete / new BCP).<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No; However, the document touches work that is done in other standards bodies <br>such as IEEE, CableLabs, WFA, 3GPP, ITU. Participants in those organisations <br>were part of the discussions and active feedback was also provided (e.g. DOCSIS-<br>PIE)<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with <br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware <br>of? <br><br>A substancial part of the document was updated during WGLC on the insistence of <br>one WG member; As they don't touch the main content, review of these sections <br>(2-4) by the WG has been more limited.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, <br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the <br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is strong concensus on the document, with very few individuals disagreeing <br>with some of the text. However, that disagreement does not appear to be about <br>the technical parts. [[Check for -07]]<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this <br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>This point has been discussed in confidence with the responsible AD. <br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). <br>Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>No idnits issues, that weren't also discussed in the WG (<a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> update wording <br>in the abstact), with the current version what the WG has found to be most <br>appropriate.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such <br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal reviews necessary.<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either <br>normative or informative?<br><br>Yes, all references are accounted for, and are split in normative and <br>informative, as appropriate.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for <br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references <br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, <br>list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call <br>procedure.<br><br>There are no downref references at the time of this writeup.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and <br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and <br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the <br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this <br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>Yes; former BCP <a href="/doc/rfc2309/">RFC2309</a> will be obsoleted, as the guidance given herein is <br>complete and self-contained.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, <br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm <br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the <br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA <br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA <br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the <br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and <br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>No IANA actions required, no protocol updates are part of the document.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future <br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in <br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to <br>validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML <br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>This RFC does not have any sections containing formal language, thus this is<br>not applicable.<br><br></div></td>
