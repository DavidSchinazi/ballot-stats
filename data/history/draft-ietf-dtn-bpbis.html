Before I can recommend this, I have several DISCUSS points and comments that I would like to address:<br><br>1) Routing decisions, discovery of endpoints to contact for forwarding and retry strategies are listed as out-of-scope for this document. This is not sufficient for writing an interoperable implementation, unless there is a separate document that provides such details.<br>Below I describe 3 relevant places in the text and suggest some possible ways of addressing my DISCUSS:<br><br>5.4. Bundle Forwarding<br><br>&nbsp;  Step 2: The bundle protocol agent MUST determine whether or not<br>&nbsp;  forwarding is contraindicated (that is, rendered inadvisable) for<br>&nbsp;  any of the reasons listed in Figure 4. In particular:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  . The bundle protocol agent MAY choose either to forward the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bundle directly to its destination node(s) (if possible) or to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forward the bundle to some other node(s) for further<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forwarding. The manner in which this decision is made may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; depend on the scheme name in the destination endpoint ID and/or<br><br>Lack of this information (how node to forward to are discovered) would prevent interoperability.<br>(By comparison, SMTP specification which has somewhat similar design<br>contains information about how next nodes to forward to are selected.)<br><br>I think you need to create a new section in this document specifying requirements<br>on URI scheme documents and include this as a MUST level requirement there.<br>(If you already have a document that does this, you can just normatively point to it.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on other state but in any case is beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document. If the BPA elects to forward the bundle to some other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node(s) for further forwarding but finds it impossible to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; select any node(s) to forward the bundle to, then forwarding is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contraindicated.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  . Provided the bundle protocol agent succeeded in selecting the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node(s) to forward the bundle to, the bundle protocol agent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST subsequently select the convergence layer adapter(s) whose<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; services will enable the node to send the bundle to those<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nodes.&nbsp; The manner in which specific appropriate convergence<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; layer adapters are selected is beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document.<br><br>Similar to the above: lack of description of how convergence layers are discovered<br>(for example this might include discovery using DNS or something else) or, alternatively,<br>a mandatory to implement convergence layer would affect interoperability.<br>I think you need to add this as a requirement to section 7 ("Services Required of the Convergence Layer").<br><br>Also having some (even non normative) information<br>about which convergence layer to select if multiple are available would be useful.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the agent finds it impossible to select any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appropriate convergence layer adapter(s) to use in forwarding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this bundle, then forwarding is contraindicated.<br><br>&nbsp;  Step 5: When all selected convergence layer adapters have informed<br>&nbsp;  the bundle protocol agent that they have concluded their data<br>&nbsp;  sending procedures with regard to this bundle, processing may depend<br>&nbsp;  on the results of those procedures.&nbsp; If completion of the data<br>&nbsp;  sending procedures by all selected convergence layer adapters has<br>&nbsp;  not resulted in successful forwarding of the bundle (an<br>&nbsp;  implementation-specific determination that is beyond the scope of<br>&nbsp;  this specification), then the bundle protocol agent MAY choose (in<br>&nbsp;  an implementation-specific manner, again beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp;  specification) to initiate another attempt to forward the bundle.<br><br>Similar to the above: retries affect interoperability and should be documented<br>as description of a convergence layer document.<br>I think you need to add this as a requirement to section 7 ("Services Required of the Convergence Layer").<br><br>&nbsp;  In that event, processing proceeds from Step 4 of Section 5.4.<br><br>2) As pointed out by Benjamin Schwartz:<br><br>In Section 5.4.2<br><br>Consistency: This section relies on the presence of a Previous Node block, but nothing in the forwarding procedure instructs any agent to add a Previous Node block.<br><br>Correctness: If two nodes both opt to return failed bundles, how are they to avoid a ping-pong loop?<br><br>3) As pointed out by Benjamin Schwartz:<br><br>In Section 5.6<br><br>Error handling: What about CBOR parsing failures?</div></td>

a more unified scheme that always<br>provides cryptographic integrity protection would have simpler encoding<br>rules.&nbsp; I rather wonder why it's not possible to roll the CRC as a mechanism<br>for detecting media-induced errors into the CLA functionality as opposed to<br>needing to be in the top-level BPA.&nbsp; Then media not susceptible to errors<br>could use no or a small CRC and more malleable media could use stronger<br>CRCs, leaving the decision closer to the knowledge of the transport<br>properties.<br><br>Is a registration something that conceptually lives "in the network", or a<br>purely local matter to the node in question?&nbsp; What about active vs. passive<br>state thereof?<br><br>The creation timestamp, sequence number, and lifetime can serve to some<br>extent to detect replay of old data, though given the environments we expect<br>this to operate in, it may be hard to differentiate a replay from normal<br>delivery.&nbsp; I don't see any mechanisms that would allow for detection of<br>dropped bundles (whether due to attack or other error), though it's not<br>entirely clear that such a mechanism is possible in these environments.<br>It may also be worth considering whether there is use for the ability detect<br>a truncated application-layer "stream" that's a group of bundles related to<br>each other in some way.&nbsp; I do see that the protocol is largely focused on<br>bundles as discrete units, and so expect the answer to be "no", but this is<br>one of the more standard security mechanisms, so I wanted to explicitly<br>check.&nbsp; Similarly, one might imagine a block type that indicates the initial<br>block types present in a bundle, which could be (required to be) subject to<br>integrity protection so that removal of blocks could be detected at the<br>recipient.<br>Some further discussion of these points, in terms of the goals for<br>these environments and what behaviors are actually attained, might be<br>appropriate in the security considerations section.<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Application Data Unit (ADU) - An application data unit is the unit<br>&nbsp;  of data whose conveyance to the bundle's destination is the purpose<br>&nbsp;  for the transmission of some bundle that is not a fragment (as<br>&nbsp;  defined below).<br><br>I understand the desire for precision, but this definition feels very<br>convoluted and could perhaps be made more accessible to an application<br>author.<br><br>&nbsp;  Bundle node - A bundle node (or, in the context of this document,<br>&nbsp;  simply a "node") is any entity that can send and/or receive bundles.<br>&nbsp;  Each bundle node has three conceptual components, defined below, as<br>&nbsp;  shown in Figure 2: a "bundle protocol agent", a set of zero or more<br>&nbsp;  "convergence layer adapters", and an "application agent".<br><br>If a node always has an application agent, won't anything done by that<br>application agent make the node also part of an endpoint?&nbsp; Yet we discuss<br>waypoint nodes that are not endpoints...<br><br>&nbsp;  Delivery - A bundle is considered to have been delivered at a node<br>&nbsp;  subject to a registration as soon as the application data unit that<br>&nbsp;  is the payload of the bundle, together with any relevant metadata<br>&nbsp;  (an implementation matter), has been presented to the node's<br>&nbsp;  application agent in a manner consistent with the state of that<br>&nbsp;  registration.<br><br>Is this metadata considered attached to the ADU or the bundle or something<br>else?<br><br>&nbsp;  Delivery failure action - The delivery failure action of a<br>&nbsp;  registration is the action that is to be taken when a bundle that is<br>&nbsp;  "deliverable" subject to that registration is received at a time<br>&nbsp;  when the registration is in the Passive state.<br><br>Just to check my understanding: with registrations being<br>per-(node,endpoint), in a case where many nodes are in an endpoint, we'll<br>undertake a delivery failure action for each node with a passive<br>registration even if the bundle is successfully delivered to a different<br>node with an active registration?&nbsp; How does this interact with the<br>"report-to" EID?<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Every CLA implements its own thin layer of protocol, interposed<br>&nbsp;  between BP and the (usually "top") protocol(s) of the underlying<br>&nbsp;  native protocol stack; this "CL protocol" may only serve to<br>&nbsp;  multiplex and de-multiplex bundles to and from the underlying native<br>&nbsp;  protocol, or it may offer additional CL-specific functionality. The<br>&nbsp;  manner in which a CLA sends and receives bundles, as well as the<br>&nbsp;  definitions of CLAs and CL protocols, are beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp;  specification.<br><br>We still need to specify what interfaces a CLA needs to present to the BPA,<br>though!&nbsp; Section 7 is a start at this (and probably worth cross-referencing<br>from here), though it feels pretty sparse.<br><br>&nbsp;  In the case of a node that serves simply as a BP "router", the AA<br>&nbsp;  may have no application-specific element at all. The application-<br><br>(But earlier we said that a node has all three elements, including an<br>application agent.&nbsp; What would the Administrative Element do on such a<br>"router" node?)<br><br>&nbsp;  The destination of every bundle is an endpoint, which may or may not<br>&nbsp;  be singleton.&nbsp; The source of every bundle is a node, identified by<br>&nbsp;  the endpoint ID for some singleton endpoint that contains that node.<br><br>It might be worty a forward-reference to Section 4.1.5.2 where we record the<br>requirement for a valid endpoint ID of a given node.<br><br>&nbsp;  The bundle protocol is designed for extensibility.&nbsp; Bundle protocol<br>&nbsp;  extensions, documented elsewhere, may extend this specification by:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . defining additional mandates and constraints on processing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that conformant bundle protocol agents must perform at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  specified points in the inbound and outbound bundle processing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  cycles.<br><br>It's not clear to me how "additional mandates and constraints" can<br>successfully be imposed by protocol extensions given that the source node<br>cannot in general know the path(s) the bundle will take.<br><br>Section 4.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  When not omitted, the CRC SHALL be represented as a CBOR byte string<br>&nbsp;  of two bytes (that is, CBOR additional information 2, if CRC type is<br>&nbsp;  1) or of four bytes (that is, CBOR additional information 4, if CRC<br>&nbsp;  type is 2); in each case the sequence of bytes SHALL constitute an<br>&nbsp;  unsigned integer value (of 16 or 32 bits, respectively) in network<br>&nbsp;  byte order.<br><br>This seems to preclude the possibility of any future CRC types being<br>defined (without an update to this specification).<br><br>Section 4.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If the bundle's source node is omitted (i.e., the source node ID is<br>&nbsp;  the ID of the null endpoint, which has no members as discussed<br>&nbsp;  below; this option enables anonymous bundle transmission), then the<br>&nbsp;  bundle is not uniquely identifiable and all bundle protocol features<br>&nbsp;  that rely on bundle identity must therefore be disabled: the "Bundle<br>&nbsp;  must not be fragmented" flag value must be 1 and all status report<br>&nbsp;  request flag values must be zero.<br><br>It's also impossible for the user application to acknowledge such an<br>anonymous bundle, right, so that flag would also be zero?&nbsp; Or do such<br>reports go to the "Report-to EID"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  .

Probably too late to change now... <br><br>The section 3.2 go a little too deep IMHO in details (do we care whether the BPA is general-purpose computer?)<br><br>As a side note, I would be interested by the potential use of this bundle protocol to transport the future webpack ;-)<br><br>Please find below some non-blocking COMMENTs.<br>C1) is there any reason why the reserved bits in section 4.3.1 are not specified with the usual 'transmitted as 0 and ignored by receiver' ?<br>C2) in section 4.1.5, is there a registry or a mechanism to avoid / detect identifier collisions ?<br>C3) just curious, why is it version 7 ? <br>C4) in section 4.3.2, if the bundle age is expressed in microseconds, then I would suggest to define exactly 'most recently forwarded': by which component of the bundle node ? is it measured at the completion of the action (e.g., layer-2 serialization is finished). Section 5.4 adds some more information but not enough to my taste (is it when the forwarding decision is made or when the convergence layer has accepted it).<br>C5) in section 4.3.3., why not following the usual method of hop-limit starting at a non-zero value and being decremented at each forwarding operation ? it is like using DTN time from 2000 rather than the usual timestamp definition. Nothing bad or blocking, but, I wonder why re-inventing the wheel if there is no real reason<br>C6) the possibility of having a single bundle to generate multiple reports along its path to the 'report-to' endpoint ID per section 5.6 could possibly be used for an amplification attacks + resource exhaustion attack on traversed nodes. Should a rate limiting be mentionned ?<br>C7) section 5.9, should the re-assembly process time out ? E.g., taking into account the max bundle age ?<br>C8) section 8, I have hard time to parse the following "the Bundle Protocol version 7 specification draft (version 6)" even if I think I got it right<br>C9) section 8, an interop status (if any) between the three existing implementations would be welcome<br><br>I hope that this helps to improve the document,<br><br>Regards,<br><br>-éric</div></td>

I understand that the bundle protocol is basically an application layer protocol on top of a transport that should care about congestion control, however, the document doesn't talk much about anything related to that underlying protocol. It would be important to specify requirements for the underlying transport protocol, indicating that is must be congestion controlled or rate limited (see <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a> as a reference for rate limiting of (uni-direction) UDP-based protocols).<br><br>Further this sentence in Sec 5.1 needs more clarification:<br>“For this reason, the generation of status reports MUST be<br>&nbsp;  disabled by default and enabled only when the risk of excessive<br>&nbsp;  network traffic is deemed acceptable.”<br>It is not clear when it makes sense to enable and if enables one should probably also implement some filtering and rate limiting.</div></td>

I think it would help to add some overview text from time to time instead of going into all the details right away. E.g. maybe provide some kind of short summary/overview at the beginning of section 5 like the “Life cycle of a bundle“. In contrast I think you could cut down the section on concepts a bit (move some the implementation related notes to the appendix). Further, compared to the previous RFC, now that CBOR is used the text because actually more abstract. I think it would actually help to put CDDL fragment in body of document.<br><br>2) Sec 4.1.3 and 4.1.4: Maybe use normative language here for all or most of the musts, e.g. <br>s/then all status report request flag values must be zero/then all status report request flag values MUST be zero/<br><br>3) Quick question on Sec 4.2.2:<br>“Version number SHALL be<br>&nbsp;  represented as a CBOR unsigned integer item.”<br>The document says that this version is not backward compatible.

The current document was accepted as a dtnwg<br>&nbsp; working document July 30, 2015.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; A critical amount of the community seems to think that the DTN<br>&nbsp; Bundle Protocol is a promising approach that merits Proposed<br>&nbsp; Standard.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&nbsp; and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&nbsp; an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&nbsp; or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp; Since the publication of the Bundle Protocol Specification<br>&nbsp; (Experimental <a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC 5050</a>) in 2007, the Delay-Tolerant Networking<br>&nbsp; Bundle Protocol has been implemented in multiple programming<br>&nbsp; languages and deployed to a wide variety of computing platforms.<br>&nbsp; This implementation and deployment experience has identified<br>&nbsp; opportunities for making the protocol simpler, more capable,<br>&nbsp; and easier to use.&nbsp; The present document, standardizing the<br>&nbsp; Bundle Protocol (BP), is adapted from <a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC 5050</a> in that context.<br><br>&nbsp; This document describes version 7 of BP.<br><br>&nbsp; Delay Tolerant Networking is a network architecture providing<br>&nbsp; communications in and/or through highly stressed environments.<br>&nbsp; Stressed networking environments include those with intermittent<br>&nbsp; connectivity, large and/or variable delays, and high bit error<br>&nbsp; rates.&nbsp; To provide its services, BP may be viewed as sitting at<br>&nbsp; the application layer of some number of constituent networks,<br>&nbsp; forming a store-carry-forward overlay network. Key capabilities<br>&nbsp; of BP include:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ability to use physical mobility for the movement of data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ability to move the responsibility for error control from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one node to another<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ability to cope with intermittent connectivity, including<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cases where the sender and receiver are not concurrently<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; present in the network<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ability to take advantage of scheduled, predicted, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; opportunistic connectivity, whether bidirectional or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unidirectional, in addition to continuous connectivity<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Late binding of overlay network endpoint identifiers to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; underlying constituent network addresses<br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; This document has been discussed in the DTN working group<br>&nbsp; since the beginning of when the working group was first<br>&nbsp; formed (November 7, 2014), and its publication was one of<br>&nbsp; the primary reasons for the working group formation.<br>&nbsp; Discussion on the mailing list and at IETF WG sessions has<br>&nbsp; produced significant interest and technical feedback that<br>&nbsp; has greatly improved the document (as recorded in the mailing<br>&nbsp; list archives and meeting minutes). Publication of this<br>&nbsp; document will conclude the chartered dtnwg milestone:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "December 2016 - RFC5050bis (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis/">draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis</a>)".<br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; Multiple interoperable implementations of [<a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC5050</a>] have been<br>&nbsp; deployed in significant ongoing experiments for many years.<br>&nbsp; At the time of this writing, the only known implementation of<br>&nbsp; the current document is microPCN (<a href="https://upcn.eu/">https://upcn.eu/</a>).&nbsp; According<br>&nbsp; to the developers:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; “The Micro Planetary Communication Network (uPCN) is a free<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  software project intended to offer an implementation of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Delay-tolerant Networking protocols for POSIX operating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  systems (well, and for Linux) plus for the ARM Cortex<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  STM32F4 microcontroller series.

The document shepherd review did not identify<br>&nbsp; any major issues that would interrupt the last call.<br><br>&nbsp; A thorough review of the document was then submitted to the list<br>&nbsp; by Stephen Farrell on 01/23/2017. Extensive list discussions<br>&nbsp; between Stephen, the authors and other WG participants identified<br>&nbsp; resolutions to be incorporated into a -07, the most significant<br>&nbsp; of which was the removal of the Custody Transfer function into a<br>&nbsp; separate document. The Custody Transfer function was then<br>&nbsp; published in ‘<a href="/doc/draft-burleigh-dtn-bibect/">draft-burleigh-dtn-bibect</a>’ on 06/22/2017 at the<br>&nbsp; same time as the -07 version of the BP document (with custody<br>&nbsp; transfer removed) was published. Both documents were presented<br>&nbsp; during the DTNWG session at IETF 99 on 07/17/2017.<br><br>&nbsp; Following the IETF 99 meeting, a -08 version of the BP document<br>&nbsp; was published on 08/08/2017 to address a request for a suitable<br>&nbsp; reference for the CRC functions and to add appropriate IANA<br>&nbsp; Considerations at the request of the document shepherd. No<br>&nbsp; other substantive changes were made. The working group chairs<br>&nbsp; then issued a second Working Group Last Call.<br><br>&nbsp; During the second WGLC, many contributors reviewed the document<br>&nbsp; and several posted comments for discussion on the list. These<br>&nbsp; included comments from Lucas Kahlert (several posts beginning<br>&nbsp; 08/23/2017), Juan A. Fraire (10/17/2017) and Kiyohisa Suzuki<br>&nbsp; (10/19/2017). All comments were taken under consideration and<br>&nbsp; discussed by the authors in follow-up on the list where necessary.<br>&nbsp; Resolutions were incorporated in a -09 draft version, published<br>&nbsp; 11/22/2017.<br><br>&nbsp; As the comments were being resolved, many posts to the list<br>&nbsp; expressed support for progressing the document, including Mehmet<br>&nbsp; Adalier (10/12/2017), Ruhai Wang (10/16/2017), Carlo Caini<br>&nbsp; (10/16/2017), Juan Fraire (10/17/2017), Lucas Kahlert (10/18/2017),<br>&nbsp; Kiyohisa Suzuki (10/19/2017), Marco Kaulea (10/22/2017), Marius<br>&nbsp; Feldmann (11/15/2017), Jeremy Mayer (11/16/2017) and Gilbert Clark<br>&nbsp; (11/19/2017). A dissenting opinion was expressed by Lloyd Wood<br>&nbsp; (11/18/2017) and addressed by Fred Templin (11/19/2017).<br><br>&nbsp; The document does not contain any elements that would require a<br>&nbsp; MIB doctor or Media Type review. Other reviews have been<br>&nbsp; automatically scheduled and will be conducted per standard IETF<br>&nbsp; procedures – see (5) below.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Fred L. Templin (<a href="mailto:fred.l.templin@boeing.com">fred.l.templin@boeing.com</a>)<br>&nbsp; Responsible Area Director: Magnus Westerlund (<a href="mailto:magnus.westerlund@ericsson.com">magnus.westerlund@ericsson.com</a>)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed the -06 version of the document on<br>&nbsp; 01/20/2017 following the first last-call. The review identified<br>&nbsp; several editorial issues – all of which were addressed in the -07<br>&nbsp; version and carried forward into the -08 version. Numerous comments<br>&nbsp; on the -08 version were subsequently submitted and discussed on the<br>&nbsp; list with agreed resolutions.<br><br>&nbsp; The document status for version -08 was presented at the IETF100 dtn<br>&nbsp; working group session on 11/16/2017. The group determined that the<br>&nbsp; plan of action was for the authors to submit a -09 version to address<br>&nbsp; list comments and thus end the second WGLC. The -09 version was<br>&nbsp; submitted on 11/22/2017 and reviewed by the document shepherd. The<br>&nbsp; document shepherd discussed several points for clarification with<br>&nbsp; the lead author, and it was agreed that no changes that would<br>&nbsp; require a new draft version were necessary. However, the document<br>&nbsp; was revised to -10 as a final version on 11/27/2017 to simply<br>&nbsp; change the title to “Bundle Protocol Version 7” (see item 16 below).<br>&nbsp; The document is therefore ready for progression to the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Per the actions noted above, thorough reviews have been conducted<br>&nbsp; and no known concerns or issues are noted.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; Bundle protocol security is delegated to the bundle protocol<br>&nbsp; security protocol (bpsec); security review of that specification is<br>&nbsp; clearly needed, and has been performed.&nbsp; No need for additional<br>&nbsp; review from any other perspective has been identified. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns regarding this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Ed Birrane and Scott Burleigh asserted that they knew of no<br>&nbsp; IPR requiring disclosure.&nbsp; Kevin Fall disclosed one possibly relevant<br>&nbsp; patent (USPTO 7,930,379) but no other IPR requiring disclosure.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No, no known IPR disclosure has been filed that references this<br>&nbsp; document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; This work has solid consensus from the working group, as evidenced<br>&nbsp; by the list discussions (especially following the first WGLC).<br>&nbsp; Please see (2) above regarding list posts supporting publication<br>&nbsp; as well as the list archives themselves.&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; Lloyd Wood suggested that there was a lack of support for the<br>&nbsp; document on the list on 10/17/2017. Fred Templin responded that<br>&nbsp; Lloyd was speaking only for himself (given that no others raised<br>&nbsp; objections while many expressed support) and that minority<br>&nbsp; dissenting opinions do not invalidate rough consensus and<br>&nbsp; running code.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reported only a single line that was different than "No issues<br>&nbsp; found here."<br><br>&nbsp;  -- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. 'CRC'<br><br>&nbsp; But, that references is widely used by Internetworking technologies,<br>&nbsp; e.g., as the standard for CRC calculations.&nbsp; A subsequent edition of<br>&nbsp; the draft revises this reference (for CRC-32) and adds a second<br>&nbsp; normative reference for CRC-16.<br><br>&nbsp; In reference to the Internet-Drafts Checklist:<br>&nbsp; * ABNF is used in section 10.3 of draft 14, but no reference to<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5234/">RFC 5234</a> is provided.<br>&nbsp; * The IANA Considerations section is present; the details of the<br>&nbsp; required new namespace (a registry of URI scheme types) are provided.<br>&nbsp; Details of the new "dtn" URI scheme were not provided in draft 13<br>&nbsp; but are provided in draft 14.<br>&nbsp; * Verbatim replication of the IPR Disclosure, IPR Notice, and<br>&nbsp; Copyright Notice and Disclosure are not provided.&nbsp; The language<br>&nbsp; provided is incomplete.<br>&nbsp; * While the bpbis specification supersedes <a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC 5050</a>, that RFC is<br>&nbsp; experimental; the absence of Updates or Supersedes language in the<br>&nbsp; Abstract seems appropriate.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No formal review criteria are known to be applicable.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; There is a normative reference to the Bundle Protocol Security<br>&nbsp; Specification, currently under Area Director review.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; Possible downward normative reference(s) to CRC standard(s) as<br>&nbsp; detected by idnits, noted in (11) above. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This publication does not obsolete or change the status of any<br>&nbsp; existing RFCs. The previous version of the Bundle Protocol is<br>&nbsp; specified in <a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC5050</a> as version 6 of the Bundle Protocol. This<br>&nbsp; publication specifies version 7 of the Bundle Protocol. Both<br>&nbsp; protocol versions may remain in service for some time before<br>&nbsp; the deployed base of BPv6 is fully converted to BPv7. In that<br>&nbsp; regard, maturation of the Bundle Protocol follows a similar<br>&nbsp; precedence as for IPv4 and IPv6.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA considerations have been updated to include three new values<br>&nbsp; in the existing Bundle Administrative Record Types registry created<br>&nbsp; by [<a href="/doc/rfc6255/">RFC6255</a>].<br><br>&nbsp; IANA considerations further request a new IANA registry for “URI<br>&nbsp; scheme type values” under the existing “Bundle Protocol” heading.<br>&nbsp; Initial values for the registry are given in the IANA Considerations<br>&nbsp; section, along with the appropriate document references.<br><br>&nbsp; The protocol headers specified in the document define new flag<br>&nbsp; and/or code fields that are assigned initial values. These include<br>&nbsp; the “CRC Type” (Section 4.1.2), “Bundle Processing Control Flags”<br>&nbsp; (Section 4.1.3), “Block Processing Control Flags” (Section 4.1.4),<br>&nbsp; and “Bundle Status Report Code” (Section 6.2). It was unclear to<br>&nbsp; the authors and document shepherd which (if any) of these fields<br>&nbsp; require an IANA registry; therefore, guidance from the IESG is<br>&nbsp; requested.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests a new IANA registry for “URI scheme type<br>&nbsp; values” under the existing “Bundle Protocol” heading. The initial<br>&nbsp; values in the registry correspond to scheme names already published<br>&nbsp; in existing documents and now provide numeric values corresponding<br>&nbsp; to the names.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; An expression of the Bundle Protocol specification in Concise Data<br>&nbsp; Definition Language (CDDL) is provided in informative Appendix B.<br>&nbsp; This non-normative CDDL formulation was co-written by Carsten<br>&nbsp; Bormann, one of the inventors of CDDL notation; we take this to<br>&nbsp; constitute expert review.<br><br></div></td>

The Custody Transfer function was then<br>&nbsp; published in ‘<a href="/doc/draft-burleigh-dtn-bibect/">draft-burleigh-dtn-bibect</a>’ on 06/22/2017 at the<br>&nbsp; same time as the -07 version of the BP document (with custody<br>&nbsp; transfer removed) was published. Both documents were presented<br>&nbsp; during the DTNWG session at IETF 99 on 07/17/2017.<br><br>&nbsp; Following the IETF 99 meeting, a -08 version of the BP document<br>&nbsp; was published on 08/08/2017 to address a request for a suitable<br>&nbsp; reference for the CRC functions and to add appropriate IANA<br>&nbsp; Considerations at the request of the document shepherd. No<br>&nbsp; other substantive changes were made. The working group chairs<br>&nbsp; then issued a second Working Group Last Call.<br><br>&nbsp; During the second WGLC, many contributors reviewed the document<br>&nbsp; and several posted comments for discussion on the list. These<br>&nbsp; included comments from Lucas Kahlert (several posts beginning<br>&nbsp; 08/23/2017), Juan A. Fraire (10/17/2017) and Kiyohisa Suzuki<br>&nbsp; (10/19/2017). All comments were taken under consideration and<br>&nbsp; discussed by the authors in follow-up on the list where necessary.<br>&nbsp; Resolutions were incorporated in a -09 draft version, published<br>&nbsp; 11/22/2017.<br><br>&nbsp; As the comments were being resolved, many posts to the list<br>&nbsp; expressed support for progressing the document, including Mehmet<br>&nbsp; Adalier (10/12/2017), Ruhai Wang (10/16/2017), Carlo Caini<br>&nbsp; (10/16/2017), Juan Fraire (10/17/2017), Lucas Kahlert (10/18/2017),<br>&nbsp; Kiyohisa Suzuki (10/19/2017), Marco Kaulea (10/22/2017), Marius<br>&nbsp; Feldmann (11/15/2017), Jeremy Mayer (11/16/2017) and Gilbert Clark<br>&nbsp; (11/19/2017). A dissenting opinion was expressed by Lloyd Wood<br>&nbsp; (11/18/2017) and addressed by Fred Templin (11/19/2017).<br><br>&nbsp; The document does not contain any elements that would require a<br>&nbsp; MIB doctor or Media Type review. Other reviews have been<br>&nbsp; automatically scheduled and will be conducted per standard IETF<br>&nbsp; procedures – see (5) below.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Fred L. Templin (<a href="mailto:fred.l.templin@boeing.com">fred.l.templin@boeing.com</a>)<br>&nbsp; Responsible Area Director: Spencer Dawkins<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  (<a href="mailto:spencerdawkins.ietf@gmail.com">spencerdawkins.ietf@gmail.com</a>)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed the -06 version of the document on<br>&nbsp; 01/20/2017 following the first last-call. The review identified<br>&nbsp; several editorial issues – all of which were addressed in the -07<br>&nbsp; version and carried forward into the -08 version. Numerous comments<br>&nbsp; on the -08 version were subsequently submitted and discussed on the<br>&nbsp; list with agreed resolutions.<br><br>&nbsp; The document status for version -08 was presented at the IETF100 dtn<br>&nbsp; working group session on 11/16/2017. The group determined that the<br>&nbsp; plan of action was for the authors to submit a -09 version to address<br>&nbsp; list comments and thus end the second WGLC. The -09 version was<br>&nbsp; submitted on 11/22/2017 and reviewed by the document shepherd. The<br>&nbsp; document shepherd discussed several points for clarification with<br>&nbsp; the lead author, and it was agreed that no changes that would<br>&nbsp; require a new draft version were necessary. However, the document<br>&nbsp; was revised to -10 as a final version on 11/27/2017 to simply<br>&nbsp; change the title to “Bundle Protocol Version 7” (see item 16 below).<br>&nbsp; The document is therefore ready for progression to the IESG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Per the actions noted above, thorough reviews have been conducted<br>&nbsp; and no known concerns or issues are noted.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; This work has solid consensus from the working group, as evidenced<br>&nbsp; by the list discussions (especially following the first WGLC).<br>&nbsp; Please see (2) above regarding list posts supporting publication<br>&nbsp; as well as the list archives themselves.&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; Lloyd Wood suggested that there was a lack of support for the<br>&nbsp; document on the list on 10/17/2017. Fred Templin responded that<br>&nbsp; Lloyd was speaking only for himself (given that no others raised<br>&nbsp; objections while many expressed support) and that minority<br>&nbsp; dissenting opinions do not invalidate rough consensus and<br>&nbsp; running code.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reported only a single line that was different than "No issues<br>&nbsp; found here."<br><br>&nbsp;  -- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. 'CRC'<br><br>&nbsp; But, that references is widely used by Internetworking technologies,<br>&nbsp; e.g., as the standard for CRC calculations.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This publication does not obsolete or change the status of any<br>&nbsp; existing RFCs. The previous version of the Bundle Protocol is<br>&nbsp; specified in <a href="/doc/rfc5050/">RFC5050</a> as version 6 of the Bundle Protocol. This<br>&nbsp; publication specifies version 7 of the Bundle Protocol. Both<br>&nbsp; protocol versions may remain in service for some time before<br>&nbsp; the deployed base of BPv6 is fully converted to BPv7. In that<br>&nbsp; regard, maturation of the Bundle Protocol follows a similar<br>&nbsp; precedence as for IPv4 and IPv6.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; IANA considerations have been updated to include three new values<br>&nbsp; in the existing Bundle Administrative Record Types registry created<br>&nbsp; by [<a href="/doc/rfc6255/">RFC6255</a>].<br><br>&nbsp; IANA considerations further request a new IANA registry for “URI<br>&nbsp; scheme type values” under the existing “Bundle Protocol” heading.<br>&nbsp; Initial values for the registry are given in the IANA Considerations<br>&nbsp; section, along with the appropriate document references.<br><br>&nbsp; The protocol headers specified in the document define new flag<br>&nbsp; and/or code fields that are assigned initial values. These include<br>&nbsp; the “CRC Type” (Section 4.1.2), “Bundle Processing Control Flags”<br>&nbsp; (Section 4.1.3), “Block Processing Control Flags” (Section 4.1.4),<br>&nbsp; and “Bundle Status Report Code” (Section 6.2). It was unclear to<br>&nbsp; the authors and document shepherd which (if any) of these fields<br>&nbsp; require an IANA registry; therefore, guidance from the IESG is<br>&nbsp; requested.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests a new IANA registry for “URI scheme type<br>&nbsp; values” under the existing “Bundle Protocol” heading. The initial<br>&nbsp; values in the registry correspond to scheme names already published<br>&nbsp; in existing documents and now provide numeric values corresponding<br>&nbsp; to the names.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A.</div></td>
