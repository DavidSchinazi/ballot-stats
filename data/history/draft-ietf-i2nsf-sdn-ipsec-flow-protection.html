This as the outer IP header on sender side needs to set ECN field to ECT to enable so that any CE marks can be received. I think it is reasonable to have an option to just enable ECN, but that requires several things. Secondly with the changes in <a href="/doc/rfc8311/">RFC 8311</a>, there might be need to be more explicit in the configuration of ECN to actually indicate which ECT value that should be set on send side for the established IPsec tunnel. Due to under discussion experiments with ECT values per <a href="/doc/rfc8311/">RFC 8311</a> we should verify that just copying the inner header value to the external is fine and don't break anything as path and/or marking behavior may not be the same. <br><br>I think there is also the question if <a href="/doc/rfc6040/">RFC 6040</a> needs to be referenced in this context to ensure that people pick up on that <a href="/doc/rfc6040/">RFC 6040</a> updates <a href="/doc/rfc4301/">RFC 4301</a>.</div></td>
