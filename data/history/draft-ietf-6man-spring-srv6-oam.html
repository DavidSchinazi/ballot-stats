I had hoped to be able to go through the examples<br>carefully again, but it is clear that I cannot manage to do so<br>in my few remaining hours as AD, so my review of the diff will have<br>to suffice.<br><br>I'll preserve my original ballot comments on the -11 below, for posterity.<br><br><br>ORIGINAL COMMENTS ON THE -11 APPEAR BELOW<br>=========================================<br><br>Thanks to Dan Harkins for the secdir review and Stig Venaas for the<br>opsdir review (with observation on the security considerations) and the<br>authors for updating in response to them.&nbsp; I support Roman's discuss<br>position to make the remaining updates.<br><br>The setup introducing a couple of the examples mentions the assumed link<br>metric on the links in question, but none of the procedures we describe<br>actually make use the assumed metric information -- it seems we could<br>just as easily omit mention of it.<br><br>Section 1.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nodes N3, N5 and N6 are IPv6 nodes that are not SRv6-capable.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such nodes are referred as classic IPv6 nodes.<br><br>Can I suggest using a different adjective than "classic" for this, perhaps<br>"standard"?&nbsp; The word "classic" can come with some connotations of being<br>old, outdated, or legacy, and I don't think we have IETF consensus that<br>SRv6 is the next evolution of IPv6 that relegates "classic IPv6" to such<br>a legacy status.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A SID at node k with locator block 2001:db8:B::/48 and function F<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is represented by 2001:db8:B:k:F::.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2001:db8:B:k:Cij:: is explicitly allocated as the END.X SID at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node k towards neighbor node i via jth Link between node i and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; node k.&nbsp; e.g., 2001:db8:B:2:C31:: represents END.X at N2 towards<br><br>What is the "function F" in this example?&nbsp; My understanding was that the<br>function would correspond to just End.X (and thus the value "C" for that<br>16-bit component), with the "ij" information needing to be in the<br>"argument".<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The O-flag in SRH is used as a marking-bit in the user packets to<br>&nbsp;  trigger the telemetry data collection and export at the segment<br>&nbsp;  endpoints.<br><br>If it's to be set in "user packets", who exactly is it that sets the mark?<br><br>&nbsp;  controller for monitoring and analytics.&nbsp; Similarly, without the loss<br>&nbsp;  of generality, this document assumes requested information elements<br>&nbsp;  are configured by the management plane through data set templates<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., as in IPFIX [<a href="/doc/rfc7012/">RFC7012</a>]).<br><br>Can we say anything about the scope for which the set of requested<br>information elements are configured?&nbsp; I mostly assume that it's expected<br>to, say, configure node A to export some information on seeing the<br>O-flag, and configure node B to export different information on seeing<br>the O-flag.&nbsp; But can it be configured at a finer granularity than just<br>"node", e.g., at a per-flow level?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the telemetry data from the ultimate segment in the segment-list<br>&nbsp;  is required, a penultimate segment SHOULD NOT be a Penultimate<br>&nbsp;  Segment Pop (PSP) SID.&nbsp; When the penultimate segment is a PSP SID,<br>&nbsp;  the SRH will be removed and the O-flag will not be processed at the<br>&nbsp;  ultimate segment.<br><br>This looks like a statement of fact to me, with no need to strengthen it<br>by normative langauge.&nbsp; If you need telemetry from the ultimate segment,<br>and PSP is used, you won't get telemetry based on the SRH O-flag, and<br>that's that.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  IPv6 OAM operations can be performed for any SRv6 SID whose behavior<br>&nbsp;  allows Upper Layer Header processing for an applicable OAM payload<br>&nbsp;  (e.g., ICMP, UDP).<br><br>What options are available for SIDs whose behavior does not allow such<br>ULH processing?<br><br>&nbsp;  to the correct outgoing interface.&nbsp; To exercise the behavior of a<br>&nbsp;  target SID, the OAM operation SHOULD construct the probe in a manner<br>&nbsp;  similar to a data packet that exercises the SID behavior, i.e. to<br>&nbsp;  include that SID as a transit SID in either an SRH or IPv6 DA of an<br>&nbsp;  outer IPv6 header or as appropriate based on the definition of the<br>&nbsp;  SID behavior.<br><br>I think I understand what is meant by putting the target SID as a<br>transit SID in a SRH (or encapsulated analogue).&nbsp; I'm not sure how this<br>would specifically validate that the node is exercising the behavior in<br>question (End.X here, so switching to the proper outgoing interface).<br>That is, if I'm trying to ping a given SID and confirm that it does<br>End.X properly, how does just adding an SRH confirm the cross-connect<br>part if I am still pinging that SID?&nbsp; Do I need to target the ping at<br>the "next" SID in the SID list in order to actually use the<br>cross-connect?<br><br>Section 3.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  IGP metric set to 100.&nbsp; User issues a ping from node N1 to a loopback<br>&nbsp;  of node 5, via segment list &lt;2001:db8:B:2:C31::, 2001:db8:B:4:C52::&gt;.<br><br>How does a *user* issue a ping (directly) with an associated segment<br>list?&nbsp; This seems to no longer be a "classic ping" mechanism as written<br>... perhaps there is some automated component in the system that<br>translates what the user put in the packet into a segment list?&nbsp; Or<br>should we reference some ping utility that is patched to accept<br>segment-list input in the vein of Figure 2?<br>(A similar comment applies to the traceroute analogue in Section 3.2.1.)<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The echo request packet at N5 arrives as an IPv6 packet with or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without an SRH.&nbsp; If N5 receives the packet with SRH, it skips SRH<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; processing (SL=0).&nbsp;

One is a Standards Track, 6man document, that defines the O-flag. All the meat of that document is in §2.1 and §2.2, it would make a nice, compact, readable 3 or 4 page RFC (maybe a little more once all the boilerplate was in). The other is an Informational, SPRING document, that talks about use cases at some length. It seems both cruel and counterproductive to force SRv6 implementors who are implementing the O-flag to read through the entire balance of the document just to be sure they haven't missed something important. Remember these documents will live a long time, and it seems irresponsible to clutter the essential document set with inessential use cases.<br><br>My suggestion is to split the document as outlined above.<br><br><br>Comments:<br><br>Thanks to Stig Venaas for the Routing Directorate review.<br><br>I support Roman's discuss position.<br><br>1. The Security Directorate review (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/last-call/alEuF06kwZosmLsX5FkiBVwtG4k/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/last-call/alEuF06kwZosmLsX5FkiBVwtG4k/</a>) raises a concern about privacy that hasn't been responded to, either in email or in the draft. The review says:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This draft defines a flag in the Segment Routing Header that when<br>&nbsp;  set will result a copy of the packet being made and forwarded for<br>&nbsp;  "telemetry data collection and export." That has tremendous security<br>&nbsp;  and privacy implications that are not mentioned at all in the Security<br>&nbsp;  Considerations. The Security Considerations just say that there's<br>&nbsp;  nothing here beyond those described in . I don't<br>&nbsp;  think that's the case.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe I'm completely missing something but this sounds to me like<br>&nbsp;  it enables what we used to call "service spy mode" on a router-- take<br>&nbsp;  a flow and fork a copy off to someone else. I think there needs to be<br>&nbsp;  a lot more discussion of the implications of this.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  While the revision of the Security Considerations section may be sufficient to address the "tremendous security... implications" the reviewer raises, it does nothing to address the privacy question. The reviewer has raised a serious question and deserves a serious reply to it.<br><br>2. The examples introduced in §1.3 and used throughout use the problematic convention of distinguishing unspecified portions of the IPv6 addresses with capital letters (only), as in 2001:db8::A:k::/128 (which also has an extra :: in it, by the way). It seems self-evidently a bad idea to use valid hexadecimal characters for this purpose. Please, where you don't intend to provide a literal hex digit, use a value not in the set a-f,A-F. The cited example could be rewritten as 2001:db8:X:k::/128, for example.<br><br>&nbsp;  Alternately, since these are examples, shown in an example topology, it's not clear to me why you couldn't simply write them out fully in real hex.<br><br>3. You use <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> terminology incorrectly many places in the document. Recall that <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> defines SHOULD as:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp;  3. SHOULD&nbsp;  This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; particular item, but the full implications must be understood and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; carefully weighed before choosing a different course.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  I generally use the rule of thumb that a SHOULD is almost a MUST. Here are the places you've used SHOULD:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ref1: An implementation SHOULD copy and record the timestamp as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  soon as possible during packet processing. Timestamp or any other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  metadata is not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  carried in the packet forwarded to the next hop.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Can you suggest a "particular circumstance" in which it would be OK for an implementor to NOT copy and record the timestamp "as soon as possible"? It seems as though "as soon as possible" is already a near-infinite amount of rope to allow the implementor to do anything they want, do you really need to soften it further with SHOULD? I would say this should be MUST, or give it up and make it "should" in lower-case.<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the telemetry data from the ultimate segment in the segment-list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is required, a penultimate segment SHOULD NOT be a Penultimate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Segment Pop (PSP) SID.&nbsp; When the penultimate segment is a PSP SID,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the SRH will be removed and the O-flag will not be processed at the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ultimate segment.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Since you are stating a law of physics here (well, figuratively) the SHOULD NOT seems especially inapt. If I've understand the document correctly, if the penultimate SID is a PSP SID then this scenario just won't work. So that's not SHOULD NOT, it's either MUST NOT or more appropriately, "must not" or "can't".<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The processing node SHOULD rate-limit the number of packets punted to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the OAM process to a configurable rate.&nbsp; This is to avoid hitting any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performance impact on the OAM and the telemetry collection processes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure in implementing the rate limit can lead to a denial-of-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; service attack, as detailed in Section 5.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  This is a semi-legitimate SHOULD -- except, what is the "particular circumstance" in which it would be OK for an implementor to NOT rate-limit? Either state it (or at least provide some hints) or make this a MUST. (I note the Routing Directorate reviewer also asked about this and received no answer.)<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The OAM process is expected to be located on the routing node<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; processing the packet.&nbsp; Although the specification of the OAM process<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or the external controller operations are beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document, the OAM process SHOULD NOT be topologically distant from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the routing node, as this is likely to create significant security<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and congestion issues. <br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  I have no problem with this one :-o.<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To exercise the behavior of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; target SID, the OAM operation SHOULD construct the probe in a manner<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; similar to a data packet that exercises the SID behavior, i.e. to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; include that SID as a transit SID in either an SRH or IPv6 DA of an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outer IPv6 header or as appropriate based on the definition of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SID behavior.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Again, is there a "particular circumstance" in which the OAM operation can "exercise the behavior of a target SID" without doing this? If not, it's a MUST or (probably better) a "should".<br><br>4. In Section 2.1.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The OAM process MUST NOT process the copy of the packet or respond to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any upper-layer header (like ICMP, UDP, etc.) payload to prevent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multiple evaluations of the datagram.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  "Process" is a very general term, taken literally this means the OAM process must not do anything at all with the copy it's given. Please be more specific about what you mean. I'd offer text if I had a good guess as to your intent, but I don't.<br><br>5. General comment, "classic IPv6". I find the recurrent use of the term "classic IPv6" along with "classic ping", "classic traceroute", etc, somehow jarring. We aren't marketing soft drinks! In most places you've used "classic" you could either provide no adjective at all (as with ping and traceroute) or replace with "SRv6-incapable". In some cases, the dichotomy isn't even needed, as in<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The existing mechanism to perform the reachability checks, along the&nbsp;  shortest path, continues to work without any modification.&nbsp; The&nbsp;  initiator may be an SRv6 node or a classic IPv6 node.&nbsp; Similarly, the&nbsp;  egress or transit may be an SRv6-capable node or a classic IPv6 node.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  The last sentence could easily be rewritten something like&nbsp; “Any IPv6 node can initiate, transit, and egress a ping packet.” Similarly, <br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, the egress node (IPv6 classic or SRv6-capable) does not<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  could simply omit the parenthetical.<br><br>6. Nit:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o&nbsp; Node N1 initiates a traceroute probe packet with a monotonically&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; increasing value of hop count and SRH as follows (2001:db8:A:1::,<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  "Monotonic" doesn't mean "increasing by 1 each time", which is what you mean here. There are an infinite number of valid monotonic progressions that wouldn't work for traceroute.<br><br>7. Please define "USP" before use. You should probably just put "USP" and "PSP" in §1.2.<br><br>8. Nit:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the reference topology in Figure 1, N100 uses an IGP protocol like&nbsp;  OSPF or ISIS to get the topology view within the IGP domain.&nbsp; N100<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  That should be "IS-IS" (with hyphen).<br><br>9. In your Security Considerations you say <br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not define any new protocol extensions and relies&nbsp;  on existing procedures defined for ICMPv6.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Surely the O-flag, which you define, is a protocol extension.</div></td>

The word "classic" can come with some connotations of being<br>old, outdated, or legacy, and I don't think we have IETF consensus that<br>SRv6 is the next evolution of IPv6 that relegates "classic IPv6" to such<br>a legacy status.<br><br>&nbsp;

My understanding was that the<br>function would correspond to just End.X (and thus the value "C" for that<br>16-bit component), with the "ij" information needing to be in the<br>"argument".<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;

But can it be configured at a finer granularity than just<br>"node", e.g., at a per-flow level?<br><br>&nbsp;  If the telemetry data from the ultimate segment in the segment-list<br>&nbsp;  is required, a penultimate segment SHOULD NOT be a Penultimate<br>&nbsp;  Segment Pop (PSP) SID.&nbsp; When the penultimate segment is a PSP SID,<br>&nbsp;  the SRH will be removed and the O-flag will not be processed at the<br>&nbsp;  ultimate segment.<br><br>This looks like a statement of fact to me, with no need to strengthen it<br>by normative langauge.&nbsp;

 include that SID as a transit SID in either an SRH or IPv6 DA of an<br>&nbsp;  outer IPv6 header or as appropriate based on the definition of the<br>&nbsp;  SID behavior.<br><br>I think I understand what is meant by putting the target SID as a<br>transit SID in a SRH (or encapsulated analogue).&nbsp; I'm not sure how this<br>would specifically validate that the node is exercising the behavior in<br>question (End.X here, so switching to the proper outgoing interface).<br>That is, if I'm trying to ping a given SID and confirm that it does<br>End.X properly, how does just adding an SRH confirm the cross-connect<br>part if I am still pinging that SID?&nbsp; Do I need to target the ping at<br>the "next" SID in the SID list in order to actually use the<br>cross-connect?<br><br>Section 3.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  IGP metric set to 100.&nbsp; User issues a ping from node N1 to a loopback<br>&nbsp;

 o&nbsp; The echo request packet at N5 arrives as an IPv6 packet with or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; without an SRH.&nbsp; If N5 receives the packet with SRH, it skips SRH<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; processing (SL=0).&nbsp;

The review says:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This draft defines a flag in the Segment Routing Header that when<br>&nbsp;  set will result a copy of the packet being made and forwarded for<br>&nbsp;  "telemetry data collection and export." That has tremendous security<br>&nbsp;  and privacy implications that are not mentioned at all in the Security<br>&nbsp;  Considerations. The Security Considerations just say that there's<br>&nbsp;  nothing here beyond those described in . I don't<br>&nbsp;  think that's the case.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe I'm completely missing something but this sounds to me like<br>&nbsp;  it enables what we used to call "service spy mode" on a router-- take<br>&nbsp;  a flow and fork a copy off to someone else. I think there needs to be<br>&nbsp;  a lot more discussion of the implications of this.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  While the revision of the Security Considerations section may be sufficient to address the "tremendous security... implications" the reviewer raises, it does nothing to address the privacy question. The reviewer has raised a serious question and deserves a serious reply to it.<br><br>2. The examples introduced in §1.3 and used throughout use the problematic convention of distinguishing unspecified portions of the IPv6 addresses with capital letters (only), as in 2001:db8::A:k::/128 (which also has an extra :: in it, by the way). It seems self-evidently a bad idea to use valid hexadecimal characters for this purpose. Please, where you don't intend to provide a literal hex digit, use a value not in the set a-f,A-F. The cited example could be rewritten as 2001:db8:X:k::/128, for example.<br><br>&nbsp;  Alternately, since these are examples, shown in an example topology, it's not clear to me why you couldn't simply write them out fully in real hex.<br><br>3. You use <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> terminology incorrectly many places in the document. Recall that <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> defines SHOULD as:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp;  3. SHOULD&nbsp;  This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; particular item, but the full implications must be understood and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; carefully weighed before choosing a different course.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  I generally use the rule of thumb that a SHOULD is almost a MUST. Here are the places you've used SHOULD:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ref1: An implementation SHOULD copy and record the timestamp as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  soon as possible during packet processing. Timestamp or any other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  metadata is not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  carried in the packet forwarded to the next hop.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Can you suggest a "particular circumstance" in which it would be OK for an implementor to NOT copy and record the timestamp "as soon as possible"? It seems as though "as soon as possible" is already a near-infinite amount of rope to allow the implementor to do anything they want, do you really need to soften it further with SHOULD? I would say this should be MUST, or give it up and make it "should" in lower-case.<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the telemetry data from the ultimate segment in the segment-list<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is required, a penultimate segment SHOULD NOT be a Penultimate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Segment Pop (PSP) SID.&nbsp; When the penultimate segment is a PSP SID,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the SRH will be removed and the O-flag will not be processed at the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ultimate segment.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Since you are stating a law of physics here (well, figuratively) the SHOULD NOT seems especially inapt. If I've understand the document correctly, if the penultimate SID is a PSP SID then this scenario just won't work. So that's not SHOULD NOT, it's either MUST NOT or more appropriately, "must not" or "can't".<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The processing node SHOULD rate-limit the number of packets punted to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the OAM process to a configurable rate.&nbsp; This is to avoid hitting any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; performance impact on the OAM and the telemetry collection processes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure in implementing the rate limit can lead to a denial-of-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; service attack, as detailed in Section 5.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  This is a semi-legitimate SHOULD -- except, what is the "particular circumstance" in which it would be OK for an implementor to NOT rate-limit? Either state it (or at least provide some hints) or make this a MUST. (I note the Routing Directorate reviewer also asked about this and received no answer.)<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The OAM process is expected to be located on the routing node<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; processing the packet.&nbsp; Although the specification of the OAM process<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or the external controller operations are beyond the scope of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document, the OAM process SHOULD NOT be topologically distant from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the routing node, as this is likely to create significant security<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and congestion issues. <br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  I have no problem with this one :-o.<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To exercise the behavior of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; target SID, the OAM operation SHOULD construct the probe in a manner<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; similar to a data packet that exercises the SID behavior, i.e. to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; include that SID as a transit SID in either an SRH or IPv6 DA of an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outer IPv6 header or as appropriate based on the definition of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SID behavior.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Again, is there a "particular circumstance" in which the OAM operation can "exercise the behavior of a target SID" without doing this? If not, it's a MUST or (probably better) a "should".<br><br>4. In Section 2.1.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The OAM process MUST NOT process the copy of the packet or respond to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any upper-layer header (like ICMP, UDP, etc.) payload to prevent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multiple evaluations of the datagram.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  "Process" is a very general term, taken literally this means the OAM process must not do anything at all with the copy it's given. Please be more specific about what you mean. I'd offer text if I had a good guess as to your intent, but I don't.<br><br>5. General comment, "classic IPv6". I find the recurrent use of the term "classic IPv6" along with "classic ping", "classic traceroute", etc, somehow jarring. We aren't marketing soft drinks! In most places you've used "classic" you could either provide no adjective at all (as with ping and traceroute) or replace with "SRv6-incapable". In some cases, the dichotomy isn't even needed, as in<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The existing mechanism to perform the reachability checks, along the&nbsp;  shortest path, continues to work without any modification.&nbsp; The&nbsp;  initiator may be an SRv6 node or a classic IPv6 node.&nbsp; Similarly, the&nbsp;  egress or transit may be an SRv6-capable node or a classic IPv6 node.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  The last sentence could easily be rewritten something like&nbsp; “Any IPv6 node can initiate, transit, and egress a ping packet.” Similarly, <br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similarly, the egress node (IPv6 classic or SRv6-capable) does not<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  could simply omit the parenthetical.<br><br>6. Nit:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o&nbsp; Node N1 initiates a traceroute probe packet with a monotonically&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; increasing value of hop count and SRH as follows (2001:db8:A:1::,<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  "Monotonic" doesn't mean "increasing by 1 each time", which is what you mean here. There are an infinite number of valid monotonic progressions that wouldn't work for traceroute.<br><br>7. Please define "USP" before use. You should probably just put "USP" and "PSP" in §1.2.<br><br>8. Nit:<br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the reference topology in Figure 1, N100 uses an IGP protocol like&nbsp;  OSPF or ISIS to get the topology view within the IGP domain.&nbsp; N100<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  That should be "IS-IS" (with hyphen).<br><br>9. In your Security Considerations you say <br><br>&nbsp;  ```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not define any new protocol extensions and relies&nbsp;  on existing procedures defined for ICMPv6.<br>&nbsp;  ```<br><br>&nbsp;  Surely the O-flag, which you define, is a protocol extension.</div></td>

This comment is of course non-blocking.<br><br>About the O-flag, as this I-D is about OAM, I would have expected that the document specifies some operational recommendations, e.g., collecting statistics about O-flag processing: packet count, requests ignored, ...<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>In the first sentence, is it <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> or <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> ?<br><br>-- Section 1.3 --<br>I was about to raise a DISCUSS on this one... the abstract and introduction is about SRv6 and this section uses network programming example with END.X. Suggest to either modify abstract / introduction to mention <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> or simplify the example by not using END.X (e.g., not mentioning END.X as the plain SRH adj-sid behavior is END.X -- no need IMHO to introduce the network programming nomenclature).<br><br>-- Section 2.1 --<br>Not important and feel free to ignore, but, while telemetry operation is important for OAM, OAM is broader than plain "telemetry data collect and export" (IMHO). I would have preferred the use of 'telemetry marking' for example. But, I guess it is too late to change the O-flag into a T-flag ;-)<br><br>In "packet header", is the layer-2 header included ? IPFIX can export layer-2 information, hence my question. Perhaps better to use "IP header" here ?<br><br>-- Section 2.1.1 --<br>I was again about the raise a DISCUSS on this point, S01.1 appears to be applicable to SRH/RFC 8754 while the text about PSP is clearly about net-pgm/RFC 8986. How can we reconciliate this ?<br><br>Finally, in the case of PSP, should the normative pseudo-code be changed by introducing another 'if' in the pseudo-code ?<br><br>-- Section 3.1.1 --<br>The figure 2 seems to have an incoherent 'screen shot' as 2001:db8:A:5:: is used as the ping target but the output of the ping displays "B5::". What did I miss ?<br><br>The node N4 is assumed to "performs the standard SRH processing" but later it needs to process a "PSP SID", which is not standard SRH RFC but in the net-pgm one.<br><br>-- Section 3.2.1 --<br>I wonder whether "These ICMPv6 responses are IP routed." is really useful here as plain IP routing will be applied (or do you mean no using SRH in the reply?).<br><br>The example uses "DA" while I would expect that this would be the "SA" of the received ICMP messages. But, this is cosmetic.<br><br>-- Section 3.2.2 --<br>What is a "classic IPv6 node" ? I guess it is a 'non SRv6-capable node' =&gt; to be added in the terminology section ?<br><br>-- Section 3.3 --<br>"The local OAM process sends a full or partial copy" it really smells like a postcard OAM while IPFIX can be used to send aggregated data, which is also very useful. All in all, if this is a local send to another process, then worth mentioning it.<br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>-- Section 1.3 --<br>As figure 1 uses a double border for SRv6-capable nodes, let's mention it in the text.</div></td>

This comment is of course non-blocking.<br><br>About the O-flag, as this I-D is about OAM, I would have expected that the document specifies some operational recommendations, e.g., collecting statistics about O-flag processing: packet count, requests ignored, ...<br><br>-- Section 1 --<br>In the first sentence, is it <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> or <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> ?<br><br>-- Section 1.3 --<br>I was about to raise a DISCUSS on this one... the abstract and introduction is about SRv6 and this section uses network programming example with END.X. Suggest to either modify abstract / introduction to mention <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> or simplify the example by not using END.X (e.g., not mentioning END.X as the plain SRH adj-sid behavior is END.X -- no need IMHO to introduce the network programming nomenclature).<br><br>-- Section 2.1 --<br>Not important and feel free to ignore, but, while telemetry operation is important for OAM, OAM is broader than plain "telemetry data collect and export" (IMHO). I would have preferred the use of 'telemetry marking' for example. But, I guess it is too late to change the O-flag into a T-flag ;-)<br><br>In "packet header", is the layer-2 header included ? IPFIX can export layer-2 information, hence my question. Perhaps better to use "IP header" here ?<br><br>-- Section 2.1.1 --<br>I was again about the raise a DISCUSS on this point, S01.1 appears to be applicable to SRH/RFC 8754 while the text about PSP is clearly about net-pgm/RFC 8986. How can we reconciliate this ?<br><br>Finally, in the case of PSP, should the normative pseudo-code be changed by introducing another 'if' in the pseudo-code ?<br><br>-- Section 3.1.1 --<br>The figure 2 seems to have an incoherent 'screen shot' as 2001:db8:A:5:: is used as the ping target but the output of the ping displays "B5::". What did I miss ?<br><br>The node N4 is assumed to "performs the standard SRH processing" but later it needs to process a "PSP SID", which is not standard SRH RFC but in the net-pgm one.<br><br>-- Section 3.2.1 --<br>I wonder whether "These ICMPv6 responses are IP routed." is really useful here as plain IP routing will be applied (or do you mean no using SRH in the reply?).<br><br>The example uses "DA" while I would expect that this would be the "SA" of the received ICMP messages. But, this is cosmetic.<br><br>-- Section 3.2.2 --<br>What is a "classic IPv6 node" ? I guess it is a 'non SRv6-capable node' =&gt; to be added in the terminology section ?<br><br>-- Section 3.3 --<br>"The local OAM process sends a full or partial copy" it really smells like a postcard OAM while IPFIX can be used to send aggregated data, which is also very useful.
