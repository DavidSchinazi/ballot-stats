(New TLV) in the IANA Considerations says that a "suggested value should be assigned” giving me the impression that the assignment is just a suggestion (and somehow reinforcing the text in 4.2), but the original definition in 3.2. (Relay Node Address Stack) simply says that the "value should be assigned by IANA”.&nbsp; Assuming that you simply want an assignment and that it would be what is used, please clean the text up; I suggest just referring to the value as TBD2 (in 4.2 and 8.2) and explicitly including the text about the assignment and the range (from 3.2) in 8.2.<br><br>2. Section 4.1. (Sending an Echo Request) says that the "Relay Node Address Stack TLV MUST be carried in the Echo Request message if the relay functionality is required”.&nbsp; How does the initiator know that it needs the functionality?<br><br>3. Section 4.2. (Receiving an Echo Request) "A second or more address entries MAY also be added if necessary, depending on implementation.”&nbsp; Isn’t this document defining how the implementation should work?&nbsp; What are the cases where these additional entries may be added?</div></td>

The Echo<br>&nbsp;  Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in <br>&nbsp;  false negatives or complete failure of operation. This document describes<br>&nbsp;  extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable LSRs to have the capability<br>&nbsp;  to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes.<br>&nbsp;  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>&nbsp;  2015-07-09: Pulling&nbsp; a document back this late in the process is<br>&nbsp; certainly "out of the ordinary".<br>&nbsp; The updates to the draft were discussed at the working group meeting in<br>&nbsp; Dallas, and an MPLS-RT review were done at about the same time and the<br>&nbsp; wglc was done. The effect is that the document (now) has been very well<br>&nbsp; reviewed and has good support in the working.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of implementations and deployments of this specification.<br>&nbsp;  We also have indications that vendors have plans to implement.<br> , A poll for implementations has been sent to the working group, and<br>&nbsp;  the Shepherd Write-Up will be updated as we receive more information.<br><br>&nbsp; 2015-07-09: We started a new implementation poll during the wglc, the <br>&nbsp; result is about the same, but the "intention to implement" is slightly strong.<br>&nbsp; Also one of the implementers stated that they were in the process of updating<br>&nbsp; their implementation to match the specification as it&nbsp; stands after the update.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The LSP Ping is a very commonly deployed protocol, the extensions<br>&nbsp;  described/specified in this document has been identified as necessary <br>&nbsp;  by several operators and implementers. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

The Echo<br>&nbsp;  Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in <br>&nbsp;  false negatives or complete failure of operation. This document describes<br>&nbsp;  extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable LSRs to have the capability<br>&nbsp;  to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes.<br>&nbsp;  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>&nbsp;  2015-07-09: Pulling&nbsp; a document back this late in the process is<br>&nbsp; certainly "out of the ordinary".<br>&nbsp; The updates to the draft were discussed at the working group meeting in<br>&nbsp; Dallas, and an MPLS-RT review were done at about the same time and the<br>&nbsp; wglc was done. The effect is that the document (now) has been very well<br>&nbsp; reviewed and has good support in the working.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of implementations and deployments of this specification.<br>&nbsp;  We also have indications that vendors have plans to implement.<br> , A poll for implementations has been sent to the working group, and<br>&nbsp;  the Shepherd Write-Up will be updated as we receive more information.<br><br>&nbsp; 2015-07-09: We started a new implementation poll during the wglc, the <br>&nbsp; result is about the same, but the "intention to implement" is slightly strong.<br>&nbsp; Also one of the implementers stated that they were in the process of updating<br>&nbsp; their implementation to match the specification as it&nbsp; stands after the update.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The LSP Ping is a very commonly deployed protocol, the extensions<br>&nbsp;  described/specified in this document has been identified as necessary <br>&nbsp;  by several operators and implementers. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  When the first version of <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> (a.k.a LSP Ping) were deployed<br>&nbsp;  it was quickly understood that in some inter autonomous system <br>&nbsp;  (AS) and inter-area deployments a LSR replying to an MPLS Echo <br>&nbsp;  request LSR may not have the available route to the initiator. The Echo<br>&nbsp;  Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in <br>&nbsp;  false negatives or complete failure of operation. This document describes<br>&nbsp;  extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable LSRs to have the capability<br>&nbsp;  to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes.<br>&nbsp;  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of implementations and deployments of this specification.<br>&nbsp;  We also have indications that vendors have plans to implement.<br> , A poll for implementations has been sent to the working group, and<br>&nbsp;  the Shepherd Write-Up will be updated as we receive more information.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  All the authors has replied to the IPR poll, stating that they are not <br>&nbsp;  aware of any other IPR than what is already disclosed<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is one IPR disclosure against this document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The terms quoted are such that it has not generated any discussion, we<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; have accepted such terms for along term.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The LSP Ping is a very commonly deployed protocol, the extensions<br>&nbsp;  described/specified in this document has been identified as necessary <br>&nbsp;  by several operators and implementers. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  Update to the Shepherds Writeup (for version -04) - marked Oct 2014.<br><br>&nbsp;  The ID nits points out that the pre-5378 boiler plate is used, however<br>&nbsp;  the shepherd does not think this is necessary, since both the original<br>&nbsp;  co-authors of <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> have&nbsp; granted the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP78</a> rights to the IETF Trust.<br><br>&nbsp;  Oct 2014: <br>&nbsp;  The statement above is not correct, it it true that we had the two original <br>&nbsp;  co-authors agree to grant their <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> rights to the IANA trust, however <br>&nbsp;  after further investigation there are many more people that would need to<br>&nbsp;  do the same. We have done an effort to reach all of them, but did not <br>&nbsp;  succeed, so the pre-5378 boilet plate should be used in this document. <br><br>&nbsp;  Oct 2014: <br>&nbsp;  The nits tool finds a cae of using uppercase "SHOULD" in combination with <br>&nbsp;  lowercase "not", this was introduced between version -03 and -04. The<br>&nbsp;  authors have agreed to change this for the next version.<br><br>&nbsp;  Oct 2014:<br>&nbsp;  The nits toll also find a case of an unused reference, theis was also introduced<br>&nbsp;  between version -03 and -04, authors for a short period of time had text in<br>&nbsp;  the document making this reference necessary, but before posting agreed to<br>&nbsp;  not include that text. The authors have agreed to change this for the next version. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Oct 2014:<br>&nbsp;  The nits tool find one instance of non-RFC2606-compliant FQDNs in the<br>&nbsp;  document..

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  All normative references are to existing RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no RFCs for which the status is changed, but <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> is <br>&nbsp;  updated, this is discussed in the abstract and in the Introduction.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  When the first version of <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> (a.k.a LSP Ping) were deployed<br>&nbsp;  it was quickly understood that in some inter autonomous system <br>&nbsp;  (AS) and inter-area deployments a LSR replying to an MPLS Echo <br>&nbsp;  request LSR may not have the available route to the initiator. The Echo<br>&nbsp;  Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in <br>&nbsp;  false negatives or complete failure of operation. This document describes<br>&nbsp;  extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable LSRs to have the capability<br>&nbsp;  to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes.<br>&nbsp;  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of implementations and deployments of this specification.<br>&nbsp;  We also have indications that vendors have plans to implement.<br> , A poll for implementations has been sent to the working group, and<br>&nbsp;  the Shepherd Write-Up will be updated as we receive more information.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Loa Andersson is the document Shepherd<br>&nbsp;  Adrian Farrel is the responsible AD<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is convinced that the document is ready for<br>&nbsp;  publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  No, there has been a good debate on this draft, most of it taking place <br>&nbsp;  when the individual the preceded the working group document was reviewed<br>&nbsp;  by the MPLS review team.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews are necessary.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  All the authors has replied to the IPR poll, stating that they are not <br>&nbsp;  aware of any other IPR than what is already disclosed<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is one IPR disclosure against this document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The terms quoted are such that it has not generated any discussion, we<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; have accepted such terms for along term.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The LSP Ping is a very commonly deployed protocol, the extensions<br>&nbsp;  described/specified in this document has been identified as necessary <br>&nbsp;  by several operators and implementers. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The ID nits points out that the pre-5378 boiler plate is used, however<br>&nbsp;  the shepherd does not think this is necessary, since both the original<br>&nbsp;  co-authors of <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> have&nbsp; granted the <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP78</a> rights to the IETF Trust.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd and (I think) the original authors of the <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a><br>&nbsp;  need advice on how to exactly handle this.<br><br>&nbsp;  No other nits found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such formal reviews necessary.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes - the references are correctly split up in normative and informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  All normative references are to existing RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no RFCs for which the status is changed, but <a href="/doc/rfc4379/">RFC 4379</a> is <br>&nbsp;  updated, this is discussed in the abstract and in the Introduction.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The IANA section (and the info related to in the draft) is well and clearly<br>&nbsp;  written, a new message type is requested.<br>&nbsp;  The shepherd has reviewed the IANA section several times.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such new registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  Non such automated checks necessary.<br></div></td>
