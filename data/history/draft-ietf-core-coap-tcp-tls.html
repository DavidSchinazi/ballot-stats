I have adjusted my comments below to trim them down to only those issues that remain in -09. Beyond the comments left over from -08, I am perplexed that no concrete mechanism for UDP/TCP failover is provided, nor is any discussion of the management aspects of configuring between them, nor is any discussion of which transport protocol(s) may be considered MTI.<br><br>I also wish to highlight the somewhat buried request from my original comments that I believe this document would be vastly improved by splitting it into one document that deals with TCP, and another that deals with WebSockets. They are intended for radically different environments, and a large majority of implementors will care about one but not the other. Combining into a single document just creates more work for them.<br><br>General — this is a very bespoke approach to what could have been mostly solved with a single four-byte “length” header; it is complicated on the wire, and in implementation; and the format variations among CoAP over UDP, TLS, and WebSockets are going to make gateways much harder to implement and less efficient (as they will necessarily have to disassemble messages and rebuild them to change between formats). The protocol itself mentions gateways in several places, but does not discuss how they are expected to map among the various flavors of CoAP defined in this document. Some of the changes seem unnecessary, but it could be that I’m missing the motivation for them. Ideally, the introduction would work harder at explaining why CoAP over these transports is as different from CoAP over UDP as it is, focusing in particular on why the complexity of having three syntactically incompatible headers is justified by the benefits provided by such variations.<br><br>Additionally, it’s not clear from the introduction what the motivation for using the mechanisms in this document is as compared to the techniques described in section 10 (and its subsections) of <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>. With the exception of subscribing to resource state (which could be added), it seems that such an approach is significantly easier to implement and more clearly defined than what is in this document; and it appears to provide the combined benefits of all four transports discussed in this document. My concern here is that an explosion of transport options makes it less likely that a client and server can find two in common: the limit of the probability of two implementations having a transport in common as the number of transports approaches infinity is zero. Due to this likely decrease in interoperability, I’d expect to see some pretty powerful motivation in here for defining a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth way to carry CoAP when only TCP is available (I count <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> http and https as the first and second ways in this accounting).<br><br>Specific comments follow.<br><br>Section 3.3, paragraph 3 says that an initiator may send messages prior to receiving the remote side’s CSM, even though the message may be larger than would be allowed by that CSM.&nbsp; What should the recipient of an oversized message do in this case? In fact, I don’t see in here what a recipient of a message larger than it allowed for in its CSM is supposed to do in response at *any* stage of the connection. Is it an error? If so, how do you indicate it? Or is the Max-Message-Size option just a suggestion for the other side? This definitely needs clarification. (Aside — it seems odd and somewhat backwards that TCP connections are provided an affordance for fine-grained control over message sizes, while UDP communications are not.)<br><br>Section 5 and its subsections define a new set of message types, presumably for use only on connection-oriented protocols, although this is only implied, and never stated. For example, some implementors may see CSM, Ping, and Pong as potentially useful in UDP; and, finding no prohibition in this document against using them, decide to give it a go. Is that intended? If not, I strongly suggest an explicit prohibition against using these in UDP contexts.<br><br>Section 5.3.2 says that implementations supporting block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the Block-wise Transfer Option. I can't figure out why this is anything other than a "MUST". It seems odd that this document would define a way to communicate this, and then choose to leave the communicated options as “YES” and “YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE” rather than the simpler and more useful “YES” and “NO”.<br><br>I find the described operation of the Custody Option in the operation of Ping and Pong to be somewhat problematic: it allows the Pong sender to unilaterally decide to set the Custody Option, and consequently quarantine the Pong for an arbitrary amount of time while it processes other operations. This seems impossible to distinguish from a failure-due-to-timeout from the perspective of the Ping sender. Why not limit this behavior only to Ping messages that include the Custody Option?<br><br>I am similarly perplexed by the hard-coded “must do ALPN *unless* the designated port takes the magical value 5684” behavior. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a protocol that has such variation based on a hard-coded port number, and it seems unlikely to be deployed correctly (I’m imaging the frustration of: “I changed both the server and the client configuration from the default port of 5684 to 49152, and it just stopped working. Like, literally the *only* way it works is on port 5684. I've checked firewall settings everywhere and don't see any special handling for that port -- I just can't figure this out, and it's driving me crazy.”). Given the nearly universal availability of ALPN in pretty much all modern TLS libraries, it seems much cleaner to just require ALPN support and call it done. Or *don’t* require ALPN at all and call it done. But *changing* protocol behavior based on magic port numbers seems like it’s going to cause a lot of operational heartburn.<br><br>[I have removed my comments about section 8.1, as I believe EKR is managing the TLS-related issues for this document]<br><br>Although the document clearly expects the use of gateways and proxies between these connection-oriented usages of CoAP and UDP-based CoAP, Appendix A seems to omit discussion or consideration of how this gatewaying can be performed. The following list of problems is illustrative of this larger issue, but likely not exhaustive. (I'll note that all of these issues evaporate if you move to a simpler scheme that merely frames otherwise unmodified UDP CoAP messages)<br><br>Section A.1 does not indicate what gateways are supposed to do with out-of-order notifications. The TCP side requires these to be delivered in-order; so, do this mean that gateways observing a gap in sequence numbers need to quarantine the newly received message so that it can deliver the missing one first? Or does it deliver the newly-received message and then discard the “stale” one when it arrives? I don’t think that leaving this up to implementations is particularly advisable.<br><br>Section A.3 is a bit more worrisome. I understand the desired optimization here, but where you reduce traffic in one direction, you run the risk of exploding it in the other. For example, consider a coap+tcp client connecting to a gateway that communicates with a CoAP-over-UDP server. When that client wants to check the health of its observations, it can send a Ping and receive a Pong that confirms that they are all alive and well. In order to be able to send a Pong that *means* “all your observations are alive and well,” the gateway has to verify that all the observations are alive and well. A simple implementation of a gateway will likely check on each observed resource individually when it gets a Ping, and then send a Pong after it hears back about all of them. So, as a client, I can set up, let’s say, two dozen observations through this gateway. Then, with each Ping I send, the gateway sends two dozen checks towards the server. This kind of message amplification attack is an awesome way to DoS both the gateway and the server. I believe the document needs a treatment of how UDP/TCP gateways handle notification health checks, along with techniques for mitigating this specific attack.<br><br>Section A.4 talks about the rather different ways of dealing with unsubscribing from a resource. Presumably, gateways that get a reset to a notification are expected to synthesize a new GET to deregister on behalf of the client? Or is it okay if they just pass along the reset, and expect the server to know that it means the same thing as a deregistration? Without explicit guidance here, I expect server and gateway implementors to make different choices and end up with a lack of interop.<br><br>From i-d nits (this appears to be in reference to Figure 1):<br>** There is 1 instance of too long lines in the document, the longest one being 3 characters in excess of 72.</div></td>

These arguments, if we accept them, are manifestly true for all future TLS-using protocols. Allowing CoAP to re-use an assigned port on this basis established precedent for pretty much all future protocols to do so, effectively moving the protocol demux point for future protocols from port numbers to ALPN IDs (all over port 443). It is hard to imagine an outcome *other* *than* firewall manufacturers starting to whitelist desired ALPN IDs, which effectively ossifies the available set of IDs to whatever is defined at that moment, destroying the future utility of the mechanism.<br><br>There are other issues having to do with software architecture, protocol demultiplexing in user space rather than kernel space, and operational considerations that come into play as well, but they don't technically fall under discuss criteria.</div></td>

The protocol itself mentions gateways in several places, but does not discuss how they are expected to map among the various flavors of CoAP defined in this document. Some of the changes seem unnecessary, but it could be that I’m missing the motivation for them. Ideally, the introduction would work harder at explaining why CoAP over these transports is as different from CoAP over UDP as it is, focusing in particular on why the complexity of having three syntactically incompatible headers is justified by the benefits provided by such variations.<br><br>Additionally, it’s not clear from the introduction what the motivation for using the mechanisms in this document is as compared to the techniques described in section 10 (and its subsections) of <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>. With the exception of subscribing to resource state (which could be added), it seems that such an approach is significantly easier to implement and more clearly defined than what is in this document; and it appears to provide the combined benefits of all four transports discussed in this document. My concern here is that an explosion of transport options makes it less likely that a client and server can find two in common: the limit of the probability of two implementations having a transport in common as the number of transports approaches infinity is zero. Due to this likely decrease in interoperability, I’d expect to see some pretty powerful motivation in here for defining a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth way to carry CoAP when only TCP is available (I count <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> http and https as the first and second ways in this accounting).<br><br>I’m also a bit puzzled that CoAP already has an inherent mechanism for blocking messages off into chunks, which this document circumvents for TCP connections (by allowing Max-Message-Size to be increased), and then is forced to offer remedies for the resultant head-of-line blocking issues. If you didn’t introduce this feature, messages with a two-byte token add six bytes of overhead for every 1024 bytes of content — less than 0.6% size inflation. It seems like a lot of complicated machinery — which has a built-in foot-gun that you have to warn people about misusing — for a very tiny gain. I know it’s relatively late in the process, but if these trade-offs haven't had a lot of discussion yet, it’s probably worth at least giving them some additional thought.<br><br>I’ll note that the entire BERT mechanism seems to fall into the same trap of adding extra complexity for virtually nonexistent savings. CoAP headers are, by design, tiny. It seems like a serious over-optimization to try to eliminate them in this fashion. In particular, you’re making the actual implementation code larger to save a trivial number of bits on the wire; I was under the impression that many of the implementation environments CoAP is intended for had some serious on-chip restrictions that would point away from this kind of additional complexity.<br><br>Specific comments follow.<br><br>Section 3.3, paragraph 3 says that an initiator may send messages prior to receiving the remote side’s CSM, even though the message may be larger than would be allowed by that CSM.&nbsp; What should the recipient of an oversized message do in this case? In fact, I don’t see in here what a recipient of a message larger than it allowed for in its CSM is supposed to do in response at *any* stage of the connection. Is it an error? If so, how do you indicate it? Or is the Max-Message-Size option just a suggestion for the other side? This definitely needs clarification. (Aside — it seems odd and somewhat backwards that TCP connections are provided an affordance for fine-grained control over message sizes, while UDP communications are not.)<br><br>Section 4.4 has a prohibition against using WebSockets keepalives in favor of using CoAP ping/pong. Section 3.4 has no similar prohibition against TCP keepalives, while the rationale would seem to be identical. Is this asymmetry intentional? (I’ll also note that the presence of keepalive mechanisms in both TCP and WebSockets would seem to make the addition of new CoAP primitives for the same purpose unnecessary, but I suspect this has already been debated).<br><br>Section 5 and its subsections define a new set of message types, presumably for use only on connection-oriented protocols, although this is only implied, and never stated. For example, some implementors may see CSM, Ping, and Pong as potentially useful in UDP; and, finding no prohibition in this document against using them, decide to give it a go. Is that intended? If not, I strongly suggest an explicit prohibition against using these in UDP contexts.<br><br>Section 5.3.2 says that implementations supporting block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the Block-wise Transfer Option. I can't figure out why this is anything other than a "MUST". It seems odd that this document would define a way to communicate this, and then choose to leave the communicated options as “YES” and “YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE” rather than the simpler and more useful “YES” and “NO”.<br><br>I find the described operation of the Custody Option in the operation of Ping and Pong to be somewhat problematic: it allows the Pong sender to unilaterally decide to set the Custody Option, and consequently quarantine the Pong for an arbitrary amount of time while it processes other operations. This seems impossible to distinguish from a failure-due-to-timeout from the perspective of the Ping sender. Why not limit this behavior only to Ping messages that include the Custody Option?<br><br>[Moved from Comment to Discuss: I find the unmotivated definition of the default port for “coaps+tcp” to 443 — a port that is already assigned to https — to be surprising, to put it mildly. This definitely needs motivating text, and I suspect it's actually wrong.]<br><br>I am similarly perplexed by the hard-coded “must do ALPN *unless* the designated port takes the magical value 5684” behavior. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a protocol that has such variation based on a hard-coded port number, and it seems unlikely to be deployed correctly (I’m imaging the frustration of: “I changed both the server and the client configuration from the default port of 5684 to 49152, and it just stopped working. Like, literally the *only* way it works is on port 5684. I've checked firewall settings everywhere and don't see any special handling for that port -- I just can't figure this out, and it's driving me crazy.”). Given the nearly universal availability of ALPN in pretty much all modern TLS libraries, it seems much cleaner to just require ALPN support and call it done. Or *don’t* require ALPN at all and call it done. But *changing* protocol behavior based on magic port numbers seems like it’s going to cause a lot of operational heartburn.<br><br>The final paragraph of section 8.1 is very confusing, making it somewhat unclear which of the three modes must be implemented on a CoAP client, and which must be implemented on a CoAP server. Read naïvely, this sounds like clients are required to do only one (but one of their choosing) of these three, while servers are required to also do only one (again, of their choosing). It seems that the chance of finding devices that could interoperate under such circumstances is going to be relatively low: to work together, you would have to find a client and a server that happened to make the same implementation choice among these three. What I’m used to in these kinds of cases is: (a) server must implement all, client can choose to implement only one (or more), (b) client must implement all, server can choose to implement only one (or more), or (c) client and server must implement a specifically named lowest-common denominator, and can negotiate up from there. Pretty much anything else (aside from strange “everyone must implement two of three” schemes) will end up with interop issues.<br><br>Although the document clearly expects the use of gateways and proxies between these connection-oriented usages of CoAP and UDP-based CoAP, Appendix A seems to omit discussion or consideration of how this gatewaying can be performed. The following list of problems is illustrative of this larger issue, but likely not exhaustive. (I'll note that all of these issues evaporate if you move to a simpler scheme that merely frames otherwise unmodified UDP CoAP messages)<br><br>Section A.1 does not indicate what gateways are supposed to do with out-of-order notifications. The TCP side requires these to be delivered in-order; so, do this mean that gateways observing a gap in sequence numbers need to quarantine the newly received message so that it can deliver the missing one first? Or does it deliver the newly-received message and then discard the “stale” one when it arrives? I don’t think that leaving this up to implementations is particularly advisable.<br><br>Section A.3 is a bit more worrisome. I understand the desired optimization here, but where you reduce traffic in one direction, you run the risk of exploding it in the other. For example, consider a coap+tcp client connecting to a gateway that communicates with a CoAP-over-UDP server. When that client wants to check the health of its observations, it can send a Ping and receive a Pong that confirms that they are all alive and well. In order to be able to send a Pong that *means* “all your observations are alive and well,” the gateway has to verify that all the observations are alive and well. A simple implementation of a gateway will likely check on each observed resource individually when it gets a Ping, and then send a Pong after it hears back about all of them. So, as a client, I can set up, let’s say, two dozen observations through this gateway. Then, with each Ping I send, the gateway sends two dozen checks towards the server. This kind of message amplification attack is an awesome way to DoS both the gateway and the server. I believe the document needs a treatment of how UDP/TCP gateways handle notification health checks, along with techniques for mitigating this specific attack.<br><br>Section A.4 talks about the rather different ways of dealing with unsubscribing from a resource. Presumably, gateways that get a reset to a notification are expected to synthesize a new GET to deregister on behalf of the client? Or is it okay if they just pass along the reset, and expect the server to know that it means the same thing as a deregistration? Without explicit guidance here, I expect server and gateway implementors to make different choices and end up with a lack of interop.<br><br>From i-d nits (this appears to be in reference to Figure 1):<br>** There is 1 instance of too long lines in the document, the longest one being 3 characters in excess of 72.</div></td>

Similar to Ben's discuss, I don't understand why the format was chosen so differently. You could just use the format (plus a new length option) as defined for UPD and just never have any retransmission or reordering but be more flexible on the lower layer transport to use. However, if you actually prefer a new format (to save space), than that sounds like a new version for me, while the draft says:<br>"CoAP is defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC7252</a>] with a version number of 1.&nbsp; At this time, there is no known reason to support version numbers different from 1."<br>However, in this case it could even have made sense to define a new format/version that could be used for both underlying protocols and either have a length option or a message type and IP option.<br>Further I also don't understand why on the other hand the TCP COAP framing is re-used for websockets because websockets already provides message framing and a length field.<br><br>Also inline with Ben's discuss, the use of the Block option for CAOP/TCP is not very clear to me. The draft says:<br>"a UDP-to-TCP gateway may simply not have the context to convert a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message with a Block Option into the equivalent exchange without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; any use of a Block Option (it would need to convert the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; blockwise exchange from start to end into a single exchange)"<br>However, given that the COAP/TCP and COAP/UDP format are so different, it's anyway a more complex conversion than just sticking another transport underneath. The argument for HOL blocking due to e.g. upgrades is also not clear to me because you should probably better just use a different TCP connection for that as it really seems to be a different use case.<br><br>For me this draft looks like you are defining basically a new protocol version and not just COAP over TCP.<br><br>Again, I don't necessarily want to block this but I would like to understand why the proposed approach was chosen.<br><br>2) Comments from the tsv-art review needs to be addressed as well (Thanks to Yoshi Nishida for the review!). Here is the review text for your connivence:<br><br>"Summary: This document is well-written. It is almost ready to be published<br>as a PS draft once the following points are addressed.<br><br>1: It is not clear how the protocol reacts the errors from transport layers<br>(e.g. connection failure).<br>&nbsp;  The protocol will just inform apps of the events and the app will decide<br>what to do or the protocol itself will do something?<br><br>2: There will be situations where the app layer is freezing while the<br>transport layer is still working. Since transport layers cannot detect this<br>type of failures, there should be some mechanisms for it somewhere in the<br>protocol or in the app layer.&nbsp; The doc needs to address this point. For<br>example, what will happen when a PONG message is not returned for a certain<br>amount of time?<br><br>3: Since this draft defines new SZX value, I think the doc needs to update<br><a href="/doc/rfc7959/">RFC7959</a>. This point should be clarified more in the doc.“<br><br>3) And inline with Yoshi's comment, I don't think this part in section 3.3 is well specified; especially I don't understand how these two thing fit together:<br>"To avoid unnecessary latency, a Connection Initiator MAY send<br>&nbsp;  additional messages without waiting to receive the Connection<br>&nbsp;  Acceptor's CSM; ..."<br>and<br>&nbsp;  "Endpoints MUST treat a missing or invalid CSM as a connection error<br>&nbsp;  and abort the connection (see Section 5.6)."<br>Also how long should I wait until I abort the connection?</div></td>

The protocol itself mentions gateways in several places, but does not discuss how they are expected to map among the various flavors of CoAP defined in this document. Some of the changes seem unnecessary, but it could be that I’m missing the motivation for them. Ideally, the introduction would work harder at explaining why CoAP over these transports is as different from CoAP over UDP as it is, focusing in particular on why the complexity of having three syntactically incompatible headers is justified by the benefits provided by such variations.<br><br>Additionally, it’s not clear from the introduction what the motivation for using the mechanisms in this document is as compared to the techniques described in section 10 (and its subsections) of <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a>. With the exception of subscribing to resource state (which could be added), it seems that such an approach is significantly easier to implement and more clearly defined than what is in this document; and it appears to provide the combined benefits of all four transports discussed in this document. My concern here is that an explosion of transport options makes it less likely that a client and server can find two in common: the limit of the probability of two implementations having a transport in common as the number of transports approaches infinity is zero. Due to this likely decrease in interoperability, I’d expect to see some pretty powerful motivation in here for defining a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth way to carry CoAP when only TCP is available (I count <a href="/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> http and https as the first and second ways in this accounting).<br><br>I’m also a bit puzzled that CoAP already has an inherent mechanism for blocking messages off into chunks, which this document circumvents for TCP connections (by allowing Max-Message-Size to be increased), and then is forced to offer remedies for the resultant head-of-line blocking issues. If you didn’t introduce this feature, messages with a two-byte token add six bytes of overhead for every 1024 bytes of content — less than 0.6% size inflation. It seems like a lot of complicated machinery — which has a built-in foot-gun that you have to warn people about misusing — for a very tiny gain. I know it’s relatively late in the process, but if these trade-offs haven't had a lot of discussion yet, it’s probably worth at least giving them some additional thought.<br><br>I’ll note that the entire BERT mechanism seems to fall into the same trap of adding extra complexity for virtually nonexistent savings. CoAP headers are, by design, tiny. It seems like a serious over-optimization to try to eliminate them in this fashion. In particular, you’re making the actual implementation code larger to save a trivial number of bits on the wire; I was under the impression that many of the implementation environments CoAP is intended for had some serious on-chip restrictions that would point away from this kind of additional complexity.<br><br>Specific comments follow.<br><br>Section 3.3, paragraph 3 says that an initiator may send messages prior to receiving the remote side’s CSM, even though the message may be larger than would be allowed by that CSM.&nbsp; What should the recipient of an oversized message do in this case? In fact, I don’t see in here what a recipient of a message larger than it allowed for in its CSM is supposed to do in response at *any* stage of the connection. Is it an error? If so, how do you indicate it? Or is the Max-Message-Size option just a suggestion for the other side? This definitely needs clarification. (Aside — it seems odd and somewhat backwards that TCP connections are provided an affordance for fine-grained control over message sizes, while UDP communications are not.)<br><br>Section 4.4 has a prohibition against using WebSockets keepalives in favor of using CoAP ping/pong. Section 3.4 has no similar prohibition against TCP keepalives, while the rationale would seem to be identical. Is this asymmetry intentional? (I’ll also note that the presence of keepalive mechanisms in both TCP and WebSockets would seem to make the addition of new CoAP primitives for the same purpose unnecessary, but I suspect this has already been debated).<br><br>Section 5 and its subsections define a new set of message types, presumably for use only on connection-oriented protocols, although this is only implied, and never stated. For example, some implementors may see CSM, Ping, and Pong as potentially useful in UDP; and, finding no prohibition in this document against using them, decide to give it a go. Is that intended? If not, I strongly suggest an explicit prohibition against using these in UDP contexts.<br><br>Section 5.3.2 says that implementations supporting block-wise transfers SHOULD indicate the Block-wise Transfer Option. I can't figure out why this is anything other than a "MUST". It seems odd that this document would define a way to communicate this, and then choose to leave the communicated options as “YES” and “YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE” rather than the simpler and more useful “YES” and “NO”.<br><br>I find the described operation of the Custody Option in the operation of Ping and Pong to be somewhat problematic: it allows the Pong sender to unilaterally decide to set the Custody Option, and consequently quarantine the Pong for an arbitrary amount of time while it processes other operations. This seems impossible to distinguish from a failure-due-to-timeout from the perspective of the Ping sender. Why not limit this behavior only to Ping messages that include the Custody Option?<br><br>I find the unmotivated definition of the default port for “coaps+tcp” to 443 — a port that is already assigned to https — to be surprising, to put it mildly. This definitely needs motivating text, and I suspect it's actually wrong.<br><br>I am similarly perplexed by the hard-coded “must do ALPN *unless* the designated port takes the magical value 5684” behavior. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a protocol that has such variation based on a hard-coded port number, and it seems unlikely to be deployed correctly (I’m imaging the frustration of: “I changed both the server and the client configuration from the default port of 5684 to 49152, and it just stopped working. Like, literally the *only* way it works is on port 5684. I've checked firewall settings everywhere and don't see any special handling for that port -- I just can't figure this out, and it's driving me crazy.”). Given the nearly universal availability of ALPN in pretty much all modern TLS libraries, it seems much cleaner to just require ALPN support and call it done. Or *don’t* require ALPN at all and call it done. But *changing* protocol behavior based on magic port numbers seems like it’s going to cause a lot of operational heartburn.<br><br>The final paragraph of section 8.1 is very confusing, making it somewhat unclear which of the three modes must be implemented on a CoAP client, and which must be implemented on a CoAP server. Read naïvely, this sounds like clients are required to do only one (but one of their choosing) of these three, while servers are required to also do only one (again, of their choosing). It seems that the chance of finding devices that could interoperate under such circumstances is going to be relatively low: to work together, you would have to find a client and a server that happened to make the same implementation choice among these three. What I’m used to in these kinds of cases is: (a) server must implement all, client can choose to implement only one (or more), (b) client must implement all, server can choose to implement only one (or more), or (c) client and server must implement a specifically named lowest-common denominator, and can negotiate up from there. Pretty much anything else (aside from strange “everyone must implement two of three” schemes) will end up with interop issues.<br><br>Although the document clearly expects the use of gateways and proxies between these connection-oriented usages of CoAP and UDP-based CoAP, Appendix A seems to omit discussion or consideration of how this gatewaying can be performed. The following list of problems is illustrative of this larger issue, but likely not exhaustive. (I'll note that all of these issues evaporate if you move to a simpler scheme that merely frames otherwise unmodified UDP CoAP messages)<br><br>Section A.1 does not indicate what gateways are supposed to do with out-of-order notifications. The TCP side requires these to be delivered in-order; so, do this mean that gateways observing a gap in sequence numbers need to quarantine the newly received message so that it can deliver the missing one first? Or does it deliver the newly-received message and then discard the “stale” one when it arrives? I don’t think that leaving this up to implementations is particularly advisable.<br><br>Section A.3 is a bit more worrisome. I understand the desired optimization here, but where you reduce traffic in one direction, you run the risk of exploding it in the other. For example, consider a coap+tcp client connecting to a gateway that communicates with a CoAP-over-UDP server. When that client wants to check the health of its observations, it can send a Ping and receive a Pong that confirms that they are all alive and well. In order to be able to send a Pong that *means* “all your observations are alive and well,” the gateway has to verify that all the observations are alive and well. A simple implementation of a gateway will likely check on each observed resource individually when it gets a Ping, and then send a Pong after it hears back about all of them. So, as a client, I can set up, let’s say, two dozen observations through this gateway. Then, with each Ping I send, the gateway sends two dozen checks towards the server. This kind of message amplification attack is an awesome way to DoS both the gateway and the server. I believe the document needs a treatment of how UDP/TCP gateways handle notification health checks, along with techniques for mitigating this specific attack.<br><br>Section A.4 talks about the rather different ways of dealing with unsubscribing from a resource. Presumably, gateways that get a reset to a notification are expected to synthesize a new GET to deregister on behalf of the client? Or is it okay if they just pass along the reset, and expect the server to know that it means the same thing as a deregistration? Without explicit guidance here, I expect server and gateway implementors to make different choices and end up with a lack of interop.<br><br>From i-d nits (this appears to be in reference to Figure 1):<br>** There is 1 instance of too long lines in the document, the longest one being 3 characters in excess of 72.</div></td>
