 |SHAKE128|TBD10|128-bit SHAKE| []&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | [This&nbsp;  | Yes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br><br>I'm not sure that we really want the description to just be "128-bit<br>SHAKE" -- the 128 and 256 relate to the "capacity" of the sponge<br>construction and are not tied to the output length.<br><br>Also, I think we should consider having some "minimum output length"<br>that has to be used in order to qualify for the "Recommended:Yes".<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, IANA is to add the value of 'Filter Only' to the set of<br>&nbsp;  legal values for the 'Recommended' column.&nbsp; This value is only to be<br>&nbsp;  used for hash functions and indicates that it is not to be used for<br>&nbsp;  purposes which require collision resistance.&nbsp; IANA is requested to<br>&nbsp;  add this document to the reference section for this table due to this<br>&nbsp;  addition.<br><br>So the ordering is now "Yes, No, Filter Only, Deprecated"?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>There are probably some considerations relating to the application's<br>"additional data" used in a CBOR hash structure such as the (first) one<br>in Section 2.1.&nbsp; Making sure that all the relevant attributes/parameters<br>are bound into the computation/verification properly, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  security all need to be included as part of this analysis.&nbsp; In many<br>&nbsp;  cases the value being hashed is a public value, as such pre-image<br>&nbsp;  resistance is not part of this analysis.<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>&nbsp;  Algorithm agility needs to be considered a requirement for any use of<br>&nbsp;  hash functions.&nbsp; As with any cryptographic function, hash functions<br><br>(<a href="/doc/bcp201/">BCP 201</a> rears its head again)<br><br>Section 6<br><br>It's not really going to work so great to have normative references to<br>both <a href="/doc/rfc8152/">RFC 8152</a> and the thing that obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8152/">RFC 8152</a>.&nbsp;

If it’s going to stay, I’d like to see ar least one minor change, though I’ll defer to the Sec ADs on this point: for any hash alg, it is always possible to encounter a collision, and the text isn’t clear about what “if a collision attack exists” really means.&nbsp; I think it means not to use it if a collision attack is practical, and maybe this is a better way to say it?:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  A "collision attack" is one where an attacker can<br>&nbsp;  find two different messages that have the same hash value.&nbsp;

This is another example of the hazard of trying to explain hashing in a simple document such as this one.<br><br>&nbsp;  This is<br>&nbsp;  the difference between collision resistance and second pre-image<br>&nbsp;

Have a significant number<br>&gt; of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any<br>&gt; reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g.,<br>&gt; one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had<br>&gt; no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or<br>&gt; other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media<br>&gt; Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>John Mattsson has reviewed an early version of the document. Kathleen Moriarty<br>did a review of a pre-working group last call version of the document. Ludwig<br>Seitz and Ivaylo Petrov did a review on the working group last call version of<br>the document.

If this version of the document is not ready for<br>&gt; publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I completed a detailed review of the document. All of my remarks were processed<br>and there are no remaining open issues.<br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth<br>&gt; of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No, given the number of reviews and the relative shortness of the document, I<br>believe it has had sufficient reviews.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>&gt; perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>&gt; internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has<br>&gt; with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should<br>&gt; be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain<br>&gt; parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.<br>&gt; In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it<br>&gt; still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>No concerns or issues.<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>&gt; required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>&gt; already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, the authors have confirmed that they are not aware of any IPR.<br><br>&gt; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>&gt; summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No IPR.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>&gt; strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does<br>&gt; the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>From my perspective the WG understands and agrees with the proposed draft<br>without any other alternatives being provided.<br><br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>&gt; discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email<br>&gt; messages to the Responsible Area Director.

As this section is<br>meant to be remove by the RFC editor, I believe they should not block the<br>document from progressing.<br><br>ID nits points out that<br>- there is a reference to a document in the abstract, which should be replaced<br>&nbsp; with textual description<br>- two of the internet drafts that this document references have undergone a new<br>&nbsp; revision<br><br>I believe those issues will only require minor editorial changes, which does<br>not seem as a sufficient reason to delay the progress of the document.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,<br>&gt; such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>I am not aware of any formal review criteria that apply to this document. The<br>hash algorithms for which it defines COSE Algorithm Identifiers have passed<br>formal review.<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>&gt; normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&gt; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>&gt; references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>Only <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct/">draft-ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct</a> is a work in progress. It is past WGLC<br>which made this feel acceptable.<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If<br>&gt; so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last<br>&gt; Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>&gt; RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>&gt; abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in<br>&gt; the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the<br>&gt; document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>&gt; discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>&gt; considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>&gt; section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>&gt; document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are<br>&gt; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that<br>&gt; any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that<br>&gt; newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial<br>&gt; contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future<br>&gt; registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has<br>&gt; been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>The document adds a number of values to COSE Algorithms Registry. For those all<br>the necessary information is provided.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>&gt; allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in<br>&gt; selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>No new IANA registries.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd<br>&gt; to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as<br>&gt; XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>There are only two instances of code snippets that are given as examples. There<br>is no definition of the formal format that they follow and they are left for<br>interpretation to the reader. The snippets seem compatible with CDDL as<br>specified by <a href="/doc/rfc8610/">RFC8610</a> and follow the same format as the snippets in <a href="/doc/rfc8152/">RFC 8152</a>. I<br>believe a minor editorial change might be needed to explicitly state that, but<br>this change does not need to delay the progress of this document.<br><br>&gt; (20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with<br>&gt; any of the recommended validation tools<br>&gt; (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and<br>&gt; formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&gt; the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&gt; comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&gt; in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>No YANG modules are defined by this document.<br></div></td>
