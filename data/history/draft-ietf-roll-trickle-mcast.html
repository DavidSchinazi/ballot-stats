The document defines MPL Domain Address and indicates that all multicast data dissemination within an MPL domain is sent to that address.&nbsp; The document does not say how that address is selected or negotiated within a domain.&nbsp; One might infer from the 2nd paragraph of section 4.1 that the MPL Domain Address is the ALL_MPL_FORWARDERS address, but the wording of that section would make that an inference. Additionally, point #2 below makes me wonder if that is really the case.&nbsp; This document should be clear on the origin of the MPL Domain Address so that implementations do the right thing and can interact correctly.<br><br>2. Section 4.1 talks about devices participating in multiple MPL domains and segregating those domains by using different MPL Domain Addresses.&nbsp; Given the question above about how the MPL Domain Address is assigned/selected/negortiated, using the address to separate zones of the same scope is problematic.&nbsp; This spec should be clear that implementations need to follow the use of scope zone IDs (<a href="/doc/rfc4007/">RFC 4007</a>, Section 6) to keep different zones of the same scope separated.</div></td>
