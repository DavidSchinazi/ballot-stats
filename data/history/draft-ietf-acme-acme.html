as promised, I'm<br>switching to Yes.&nbsp; (But I support Adam's discuss and look forward to seeing<br>it come to a close as well.)<br><br>This document was quite easy to read -- thank you for the clear prose and<br>document structure!&nbsp; It did leave me with some questions as to whether<br>there are missing clarifications, though, so there are a pile of notes in<br>the section-by-section comments below.<br><br>It seems natural to feel some unease when the concept of automated<br>certificate issuance like this comes up.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, though,<br>the only substantive difference between this flow and the flow it's<br>replacing is that this one qualitatively feels like it weakens the "know<br>your customer" aspect for the CA -- with current/legacy methods registering<br>for an account can be slow and involves real-world information.&nbsp; Such can<br>be spoofed/forged, of course, but ACME seems to be weakening some aspect by<br>automating it.&nbsp; Given the spoofability, though, this weakening does not<br>seem to be a particular concern with the document.<br><br>I was going to suggest mentioning the potential for future work in doing<br>time-delayed or periodic revalidation or other schemes to look at the<br>stability of the way that identifiers/challenges were validated, but I see<br>that discussion has already happened.<br><br>It's probably worth going over the examples and checking whether nonce<br>values are repeated in ways that are inconsistent with expected usage.&nbsp; For<br>example, I see these three values appearing multiple times (but I did not<br>cross-check if a nonce returned in the Replay-Nonce response header was<br>then used in a JWS header attribute):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 K60BWPrMQG9SDxBDS_xtSw<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 IXVHDyxIRGcTE0VSblhPzw<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 JHb54aT_KTXBWQOzGYkt9A<br><br>Perhaps the examples could be offset by a description of what they are?<br>(They would probably also benefit from a disclaimer that the whitespace in<br>the JSON is for ease of reading only.)<br><br>Section-by-section comments follow.<br><br>Abstract (also Introduction)<br><br>If I read "authentication of domain names" with no context, I would be more<br>likely to think of the sort of challenge/authorization process that this<br>document describes, than I would be to think of using an X.509 certificate<br>to authenticate myself as being the owner of a given domain name.&nbsp; But it's<br>unclear whether there's an alternative phrasing that would be better.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA<br>&nbsp;  verification of information about the certificate subject.&nbsp; "Domain<br>&nbsp;  Validation" (DV) certificates are by far the most common type.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  only validation the CA is required to perform in the DV issuance<br>&nbsp;  process is to verify that the requester has effective control of the<br>&nbsp;  domain.<br><br>Can we get an (informative) ref for the "required"/requirements?<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br><a href="http://W3C.CR">W3C.CR</a>-cors-2013-0129 shows up as "outdated" when I follow the link.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>IMPORTANT: The JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry does<br>not appear to include an explicit indicator of whether an algorithm is<br>MAC-based; do we need to include text on how to make such a determination?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>For servers following the "SHOULD ... string equality check" and for<br>requests where the equality check fails, does that fall into the "MUST<br>reject the request as unauthorized" bucket?<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to protect ACME resources from any possible replay attacks,<br>&nbsp;  ACME requests have a mandatory anti-replay mechanism.<br><br>We don't seem to actually define what an "ACME request" is that I can see.<br>From context, this requirement only applies to JWS POST bodies, and not to,<br>say, newNonce, but I wonder if some clarification would be useful.<br><br>IMPORTANT: How tightly are these nonces scoped?&nbsp; Are they only good on a<br>specific TLS connection?&nbsp; Bound to an account key pair?&nbsp; Globally valid?<br>(This is not a DISCUSS point because AFAICT there is no loss in security if<br>the nonce space is global to the server.)<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>IMPORTANT: Providing an accountDoesNotExist error type probably means we<br>need to give guidance that the server should choose account URLs in a<br>non-guessable way, to avoid account enumeration attacks.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] Servers<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT use the ACME URN namespace Section 9.6 for errors other than<br>&nbsp;  the standard types.<br><br>"standard" as determined by inclusion in this document, or in the IANA<br>registry?<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>The "up" link relation for going from certificate to chain seems to only be<br>needed for alternate content types that can only represent a single<br>certificate.&nbsp; (Also, the "alternate" link relation is used to provide<br>alternate certifciation chains.)&nbsp; Could this text be made more clear?<br><br>Presumably this is just my confusion, but what does "GET order certificate"<br>mean?<br><br>Section 7.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] It is a JSON<br>&nbsp;  object, whose field names are drawn from the following table and<br>&nbsp;  whose values are the corresponding URLs.<br><br>Er, from the IANA registry, right?<br><br>&nbsp;  The following metadata items are defined, all of which are OPTIONAL:<br><br>Maybe also refer to the registry?<br><br>Section 7.1.2<br><br>IMPORTANT: I'm unclear if the "contact" is supposed to be a "talk to a<br>human" thing or not.&nbsp; If there are supposed to be different URLs that are<br>used for different purposes, wouldn't more metadata be needed about them?<br>So it seems most likely that this is indeed "talk to a human", in which<br>case that might be worth mentioning.&nbsp; (Are these always going to be<br>mailto:?)<br><br>Section 7.1.2.1<br><br>IMPORTANT: Am I reading this correctly that the GET to the orders URL does<br>not require the client to be authenticated, in effect relying on<br>security-through-obscurity (of the account URL) for indicating which<br>account is trying to order certificates for which identifiers?<br><br>Section 7.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  challenges (required, array of objects):&nbsp; For pending authorizations,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the challenges that the client can fulfill in order to prove<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; possession of the identifier.&nbsp; For final authorizations (in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "valid" or "invalid" state), the challenges that were used.&nbsp; Each<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; array entry is an object with parameters required to validate the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; challenge.&nbsp; A client should attempt to fulfill one of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; challenges, and a server should consider any one of the challenges<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sufficient to make the authorization valid.<br><br>This leaves me slightly confused.&nbsp; A final authorization can have multiple<br>challenges.&nbsp; But a client should only attempt to fulfill one, and a server<br>should treat any one as sufficient.&nbsp; So I can only get to the case with<br>multiple challenges present in a final order of both "should"s are<br>violated?&nbsp; Is there a way for the server to express that multiple<br>challenges are going to be required?<br>Hmm, but Section 7.1.6's flow chart for Authorization objects says that a<br>single challenge's transition to valid also makes the authorization<br>transition to valid, which would seem to close the window?<br>Section 7.5.1 has inline text that implicitly assumes that only one<br>challenge will be completed/validated.<br><br>&nbsp;  wildcard (optional, boolean):&nbsp; For authorizations created as a result<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a newOrder request containing a DNS identifier with a value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that contained a wildcard prefix this field MUST be present, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; true.<br><br>Is there a difference between false and absent?<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A client creates a new account with the server by sending a POST<br>&nbsp;  request to the server's new-account URL.&nbsp; The body of the request is<br>&nbsp;  a stub account object optionally containing the "contact" and<br>&nbsp;  "termsOfServiceAgreed" fields.<br><br>Given that we go on to describe those two and also the optional<br>onlyReturnExisting and externalAccountBinding fields, does this list need<br>expanding?<br><br>IMPORTANT: How does the client know if a termsOfService in the directory is<br>actually required or just optional?&nbsp; (There doesn't seem to be a dedicated<br>error type for this?)&nbsp; The text as-is seems to only say that if the server<br>requires it, the field must be present in the directory, but not the other<br>way around.&nbsp; I guess Section 7.3.4 describes the procedure for a similar<br>case; should the same thing happen for the original terms acceptance?<br><br>IMPORTANT: The example response uses what appears to be a sequential<br>counter for account ID in the returned account URL, which loses any sort of<br>security-through-obscurity protections if those were desired.&nbsp; Should a<br>more opaque URL component be present, maybe a UUID?&nbsp; (The "orders" field<br>would need to be modified accordingly, of course, and this pattern appears<br>in later examples, as well.)<br><br>Section 7.3.2<br><br>It's a little unclear to me whether the fields the client can put in the<br>POST are the ones listed from Section 7.3 or 7.1.2, or the full set from<br>the registry.&nbsp; But presumably the server must ignore the "status" field,<br>too, or at least some values should be disallowed!&nbsp; The IANA registry's<br>"configurable" column may not quite be the right thing for this usage,<br>especially given how account deactivation works.<br><br>Section 7.3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The server MAY require a value for the "externalAccountBinding" field<br>&nbsp;  to be present in "newAccount" requests.<br><br>All requests including queries for the current status and modification of<br>existing accounts?&nbsp; Or just creation of new ones?<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable ACME account binding, the CA operating the ACME server<br>&nbsp;  needs to provide the ACME client with a MAC key and a key identifier,<br>&nbsp;  using some mechanism outside of ACME.<br><br>This key needs to also be tied to the external account in question, right?<br>One might even say that it is provided not to the ACME client, but to the<br>external account holder, who is also running an ACME client.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] The payload of<br>&nbsp;  this JWS is the account key being registered, in JWK form.<br><br>This is presumably my fault and not the document's, but I had to read this<br>a few time to bind it as the ACME account key, and not the external MAC<br>key.<br><br>&nbsp;  If a CA requires that new-account requests contain an<br>&nbsp;  "externalAccountBinding" field, then it MUST provide the value "true"<br>&nbsp;  in the "externalAccountRequired" subfield of the "meta" field in the<br>&nbsp;  directory object.&nbsp; If the CA receives a new-account request without [...]<br><br>nit: maybe "If such a CA"?<br><br>IMPORTANT: I don't think I understand why "nonce" MUST NOT be present in<br>the external-binding JWS object, though I think I understand why one is not<br>needed in order to bind the MAC to the current transaction.&nbsp; (That is, this<br>is in effect a "triply nested" construct, where a standalone MAC that<br>certifies an ACME account (public) key as being authorized by the<br>external-account holder to act on behal of that external account.&nbsp; But this<br>standalone MAC will only be accepted by the ACME server in the context of<br>the outer JWS POST, that must be signed by the ACME account key, which is<br>assumed to be kept secure by the ACME client, ensuring that both<br>key-holding entities agree to the account linkage.)&nbsp; Proof of freshness of<br>the commitment from the external account holder to authorize the ACME<br>account key would only be needed if there was a scenario where the external<br>account holder would revoke that association, which does not seem to be a<br>workflow supported by this document.&nbsp; Any need to effectuate such a<br>revocation seems like it would involve issuing a new MAC key for the<br>external account (and invalidating the old one), and revoking/deactivating<br>the ACME account, which is a somewhat heavy hammer but perhaps reasonable<br>for such a scenario.<br>Account key rollover just says that the nonce is NOT REQUIRED, and also<br>uses some nicer (to me) language about "outer JWS" and "inner JWS".&nbsp; It<br>might be nice to synchronize these two sections.<br><br>Section 7.3.7<br><br>IMPORTANT: The "url" in this example looks like an account URL, not an<br>account-deactivation url.&nbsp; If they are one and the same, please include<br>some body text to this effect as is done for account update in Section<br>7.3.2.<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>Is Section 7.1.3 or the registry a better reference for the request<br>payload's fields?<br><br>Does the exact-match policy (e.g., on notBefore and notAfter) result in CA<br>maximum lifetime policies needing to be hardcoded in client software (as<br>opposed to being discoverable at runtime)?<br><br>(I like the order url in the example, "[...]/order/asdf".&nbsp; Not much entropy<br>though.)<br><br>IMPORTANT: Why does the example response include an identifier of<br><a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> that was not in the request?<br><br>Is the "order's requested identifiers appear in commonName or<br>subjectAltName" requirement an exclusive or?<br><br>After a valid request to finalize has been issued, are "pending" or "ready"<br>still valid statuses that could be returned for that order?<br><br>Section 7.4.1<br><br>Elsewhere when we list "identifier (required, object)" in a JWS payload we<br>also inline the "type" and "value" breakdown of the object.<br><br>How is "expires" set for this pre-authorization object?<br><br>We probably need a reference for "certificate chain as defined in TLS".<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>"When a client receives an order from the server" is a bit jarring without<br>some additional context of "in a reply to a new-order request" or "an order<br>object" or similar.<br><br>Section 7.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To do this, the client updates the authorization object received from<br>&nbsp;  the server by filling in any required information in the elements of<br>&nbsp;  the "challenges" dictionary.<br><br>"challenges" looks like an array of objects, not directly a dictionary with<br>elements within it.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>IMPORTANT: What do I do if I get a challenge object that has status "valid"<br>but also includes an "error" field?<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] A key authorization is a string that expresses<br>&nbsp;  a domain holder's authorization for a specified key to satisfy a<br>&nbsp;  specified challenge, [...]<br><br>I'm going to quibble with the language here and say that the<br>keyAuthorization string as defined does not express a specific<br>authorization for a specific challenge, since there is no signature<br>involved, and the JWK thumbprint is separable and can be attached to some<br>other token.&nbsp; (This may just be an editorial matter with no broader impact,<br>depending on how it's used.)&nbsp; One could perhaps argue that the mere<br>existence of the token constitutes an authorization for a specified key to<br>satisfy the challenge, since the token only gets generated upon receipt of<br>such an authorized request.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>I'm not sure that 4086 is a great cite, here.&nbsp; For example, in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> we<br>say that "TLS requires a [CSPRNG].&nbsp; In most case, the operating system<br>provides an appropriate facility [...] Should these prove unsatisfactory,<br>[<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>] provides guidance on the generation of random values."&nbsp; On the<br>other hand, citing 4086 like this is not wrong, so use your judgment.<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; Verify that the body of the response is well-formed key<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authorization.&nbsp; The server SHOULD ignore whitespace characters at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the end of the body.<br><br>nit: "a well-formed"<br><br>Can we get some justification for the "SHOULD follow redirects", given the<br>security considerations surrounding doing so?<br><br>Section 8.4<br><br>Should this "token" description include the same text about entropy as for<br>the HTTP challenge?<br><br>Section 9.7.1<br><br>There is perhaps some subtlety here, in that the "configurable" column<br>applies only to the new-account request, but its description in the<br>template does not reflect that restriction.&nbsp; In particular, "status" values<br>from the client *are* accepted when posted to the account URL, e.g., for<br>account deactivation.<br><br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>Can there be overlap between the "validation server" function and the "ACME<br>client" function?<br><br>Section 10.2<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] The key authorization reflects the<br>&nbsp;  account public key, is provided to the server in the validation<br>&nbsp;  response over the validation channel and signed afterwards by the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding private key in the challenge response over the ACME<br>&nbsp;  channel.<br><br>I'm stumbling up around the comma trying to parse this sentence.&nbsp; (Maybe a<br>serial comma or using "and is signed" would help?)<br>IMPORTANT: Also, I don't see where the key authorization is signed in the<br>challenge response -- the payload is just an empty object for both the HTTP<br>and DNS challenges' responses.<br><br>Some of this text sounds like we're implicitly placing requirements on all<br>(HTTP|DNS) server operators (not just ones trying to use ACME) to mitgate<br>the risks being described.&nbsp; In general this sort of behavior seems like an<br>anti-design-pattern, though perhaps one could argue that the behaviors in<br>question should be avoided in general, indepnedent of ACME.<br><br>Section 10.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Some server implementations include information from the validation<br>&nbsp;  server's response (in order to facilitate debugging).&nbsp; Such<br><br>Disambiguating "ACME server implementations" may help, since we talk about<br>other HTTP requests in the previous paragraph.<br><br>Section 11.1<br><br>IMPORTANT: This may be an appropriate place to recommend against reuse of<br>account keys, whether after an account gets deactivated or by cycling<br>through keys in a sequence of key-change operations (or otherwise).&nbsp; I<br>think there are some attack scenarios possible wherein (inner) JWS objects<br>could be replayed against a different account, if such key reuse occurs.<br><br>Section 11.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The http-01, and dns-01 validation methods mandate the usage of a<br><br>nit: spurious comma.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] Secondly, the entropy requirement<br>&nbsp;  prevents ACME clients from implementing a "naive" validation server<br>&nbsp;  that automatically replies to challenges without participating in the<br>&nbsp;  creation of the initial authorization request.<br><br>IMPORTANT: I'm not sure I see how this applies to the HTTP mechanism --<br>couldn't you write a script to reply to .well-known/acme-challenge/<br>with . for a fixed key thumbprint?&nbsp; The validation<br>server would ned to know about the ACME account in question, but not about<br>any individual authorization request.</div></td>

I'm definitely balloting YES once we get clarity<br>on my DISCUSS, below.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I've looked at this several different ways, and I must be missing something<br>obvious -- which should make this easy to clear.<br><br>§6.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Note that authentication via signed JWS request bodies implies that<br>&gt;&nbsp; GET requests are not authenticated.&nbsp; Servers MUST NOT respond to GET<br>&gt;&nbsp; requests for resources that might be considered sensitive.&nbsp; Account<br>&gt;&nbsp; resources are the only sensitive resources defined in this<br>&gt;&nbsp; specification.<br><br>This doesn't seem correct.<br><br>For example, let's imagine that I, as a user, get the directory for an ACME<br>server, the body of which is the example in §7.1.1. Then, I go through the<br>new-account process, and receive the Account object in §7.1.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "status": "valid",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "contact": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "mailto:<a href="mailto:cert-admin@example.com">cert-admin@example.com</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "mailto:<a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "termsOfServiceAgreed": true,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "orders": "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/1/orders">https://example.com/acme/acct/1/orders</a>"<br>&nbsp;  }<br><br>Huh. Suddenly, I'm not so interested in *my* orders, because I've noticed that<br>different users' orders are apparently at a predictable URL that varies only by<br>a small integer. Curious, I change the "1" to a "2" and send:<br><br>&nbsp; GET /acme/acct/2/orders HTTP/1.1<br>&nbsp; Host: <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a><br><br>And get back not *my* orders, but someone *else's* orders.<br><br>&nbsp;  HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>&nbsp;  Content-Type: application/json<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "orders": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/1">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/1</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/2">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/2</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/3">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/3</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/4">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/4</a>"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ]<br>&nbsp;  }<br><br>Interesting.

There's a pretty good chance that... someone didn't want all of that<br>to be generally known.<br><br>Clearly I've missed something, because this just seems way too obvious.

If that's the case, I would:<br><br>(1) Expect this to be stated in section 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.3<br><br>(2) Expect a specification of a reasonable number of bits of entropy to use in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; orders list and order object URLs.<br><br>(3) Expect the examples to show appropriately random URLs (e.g.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/9258fac3-7866-4922-90e6-bbd0c89e751a/orders">https://example.com/acme/acct/9258fac3-7866-4922-90e6-bbd0c89e751a/orders</a>)<br><br><br>(4) Expect a treatment in section 10 of the risks that might arise from third<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parties gaining access to orders, as doing so provides free-and-clear access<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to private certificates (which, for dns, can be trivially used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; revoke certs; and for other types, can be used for impersonation as well)<br><br>Again, I'm still expecting that I've simply missed something obvious -- I just<br>can't for the life of me figure out what it is.</div></td>

I'm definitely balloting YES once we get clarity<br>on my DISCUSS, below.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I've looked at this several different ways, and I must be missing something<br>obvious -- which should make this easy to clear.<br><br>§6.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Note that authentication via signed JWS request bodies implies that<br>&gt;&nbsp; GET requests are not authenticated.&nbsp; Servers MUST NOT respond to GET<br>&gt;&nbsp; requests for resources that might be considered sensitive.&nbsp; Account<br>&gt;&nbsp; resources are the only sensitive resources defined in this<br>&gt;&nbsp; specification.<br><br>This doesn't seem correct.<br><br>For example, let's imagine that I, as a user, get the directory for an ACME<br>server, the body of which is the example in §7.1.1. Then, I go through the<br>new-account process, and receive the Account object in §7.1.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "status": "valid",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "contact": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "mailto:<a href="mailto:cert-admin@example.com">cert-admin@example.com</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "mailto:<a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a>"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "termsOfServiceAgreed": true,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "orders": "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/1/orders">https://example.com/acme/acct/1/orders</a>"<br>&nbsp;  }<br><br>Huh. Suddenly, I'm not so interested in *my* orders, because I've noticed that<br>different users' orders are apparently at a predictable URL that varies only by<br>a small integer. Curious, I change the "1" to a "2" and send:<br><br>&nbsp; GET /acme/acct/2/orders HTTP/1.1<br>&nbsp; Host: <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a><br><br>And get back not *my* orders, but someone *else's* orders.<br><br>&nbsp;  HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>&nbsp;  Content-Type: application/json<br><br>&nbsp;  {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "orders": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/1">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/1</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/2">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/2</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/3">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/3</a>",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "<a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/4">https://example.com/acme/acct/2/order/4</a>"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ]<br>&nbsp;  }<br><br>Interesting.

What<br>prevents this attack (or a similar one from observing that the order URLs are<br>predictable?)<br><br>If I *haven't* missed something, then there appears to have been an assumption<br>here, never written into the document, that the URLs generated for the orders<br>list and for the order objects are unguessable. If that's the case, I would:<br><br>(1) Expect this to be stated in section 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.3<br><br>(2) Expect a specification of a reasonable number of bits of entropy to use in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; orders list and order object URLs.<br><br>(3) Expect the examples to show appropriately random URLs (e.g.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://example.com/acme/acct/9258fac3-7866-4922-90e6-bbd0c89e751a/orders">https://example.com/acme/acct/9258fac3-7866-4922-90e6-bbd0c89e751a/orders</a>)<br><br><br>(4) Expect a treatment in section 10 of the risks that might arise from third<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; parties gaining access to orders, as doing so provides free-and-clear access<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to private certificates (which, for dns, can be trivially used to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; revoke certs; and for other types, can be used for impersonation as well)<br><br>Again, I'm still expecting that I've simply missed something obvious -- I just<br>can't for the life of me figure out what it is.</div></td>

It did leave me with some questions as to whether<br>there are missing clarifications, though, so there are a pile of notes in<br>the section-by-section comments below.<br><br>It seems natural to feel some unease when the concept of automated<br>certificate issuance like this comes up.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, though,<br>the only substantive difference between this flow and the flow it's<br>replacing is that this one qualitatively feels like it weakens the "know<br>your customer" aspect for the CA -- with current/legacy methods registering<br>for an account can be slow and involves real-world information.&nbsp; Such can<br>be spoofed/forged, of course, but ACME seems to be weakening some aspect by<br>automating it.&nbsp; Given the spoofability, though, this weakening does not<br>seem to be a particular concern with the document.<br><br>I was going to suggest mentioning the potential for future work in doing<br>time-delayed or periodic revalidation or other schemes to look at the<br>stability of the way that identifiers/challenges were validated, but I see<br>that discussion has already happened.<br><br>It's probably worth going over the examples and checking whether nonce<br>values are repeated in ways that are inconsistent with expected usage.&nbsp; For<br>example, I see these three values appearing multiple times (but I did not<br>cross-check if a nonce returned in the Replay-Nonce response header was<br>then used in a JWS header attribute):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 K60BWPrMQG9SDxBDS_xtSw<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 IXVHDyxIRGcTE0VSblhPzw<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 JHb54aT_KTXBWQOzGYkt9A<br><br>Perhaps the examples could be offset by a description of what they are?<br>(They would probably also benefit from a disclaimer that the whitespace in<br>the JSON is for ease of reading only.)<br><br>Section-by-section comments follow.<br><br>Abstract (also Introduction)<br><br>If I read "authentication of domain names" with no context, I would be more<br>likely to think of the sort of challenge/authorization process that this<br>document describes, than I would be to think of using an X.509 certificate<br>to authenticate myself as being the owner of a given domain name.&nbsp; But it's<br>unclear whether there's an alternative phrasing that would be better.<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  Different types of certificates reflect different kinds of CA<br>&nbsp;  verification of information about the certificate subject.&nbsp; "Domain<br>&nbsp;  Validation" (DV) certificates are by far the most common type.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  only validation the CA is required to perform in the DV issuance<br>&nbsp;  process is to verify that the requester has effective control of the<br>&nbsp;  domain.<br><br>Can we get an (informative) ref for the "required"/requirements?<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br><a href="http://W3C.CR">W3C.CR</a>-cors-2013-0129 shows up as "outdated" when I follow the link.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>IMPORTANT: The JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry does<br>not appear to include an explicit indicator of whether an algorithm is<br>MAC-based; do we need to include text on how to make such a determination?<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>For servers following the "SHOULD ... string equality check" and for<br>requests where the equality check fails, does that fall into the "MUST<br>reject the request as unauthorized" bucket?<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  In order to protect ACME resources from any possible replay attacks,<br>&nbsp;  ACME requests have a mandatory anti-replay mechanism.<br><br>We don't seem to actually define what an "ACME request" is that I can see.<br>From context, this requirement only applies to JWS POST bodies, and not to,<br>say, newNonce, but I wonder if some clarification would be useful.<br><br>IMPORTANT: How tightly are these nonces scoped?&nbsp; Are they only good on a<br>specific TLS connection?&nbsp; Bound to an account key pair?&nbsp; Globally valid?<br>(This is not a DISCUSS point because AFAICT there is no loss in security if<br>the nonce space is global to the server.)<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>IMPORTANT: Providing an accountDoesNotExist error type probably means we<br>need to give guidance that the server should choose account URLs in a<br>non-guessable way, to avoid account enumeration attacks.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] Servers<br>&nbsp;  MUST NOT use the ACME URN namespace Section 9.6 for errors other than<br>&nbsp;  the standard types.<br><br>"standard" as determined by inclusion in this document, or in the IANA<br>registry?<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>The "up" link relation for going from certificate to chain seems to only be<br>needed for alternate content types that can only represent a single<br>certificate.&nbsp; (Also, the "alternate" link relation is used to provide<br>alternate certifciation chains.)&nbsp; Could this text be made more clear?<br><br>Presumably this is just my confusion, but what does "GET order certificate"<br>mean?<br><br>Section 7.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] It is a JSON<br>&nbsp;  object, whose field names are drawn from the following table and<br>&nbsp;  whose values are the corresponding URLs.<br><br>Er, from the IANA registry, right?<br><br>&nbsp;  The following metadata items are defined, all of which are OPTIONAL:<br><br>Maybe also refer to the registry?<br><br>Section 7.1.2<br><br>IMPORTANT: I'm unclear if the "contact" is supposed to be a "talk to a<br>human" thing or not.&nbsp; If there are supposed to be different URLs that are<br>used for different purposes, wouldn't more metadata be needed about them?<br>So it seems most likely that this is indeed "talk to a human", in which<br>case that might be worth mentioning.&nbsp; (Are these always going to be<br>mailto:?)<br><br>Section 7.1.2.1<br><br>IMPORTANT: Am I reading this correctly that the GET to the orders URL does<br>not require the client to be authenticated, in effect relying on<br>security-through-obscurity (of the account URL) for indicating which<br>account is trying to order certificates for which identifiers?<br><br>Section 7.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  challenges (required, array of objects):&nbsp; For pending authorizations,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the challenges that the client can fulfill in order to prove<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; possession of the identifier.&nbsp; For final authorizations (in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "valid" or "invalid" state), the challenges that were used.&nbsp; Each<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; array entry is an object with parameters required to validate the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; challenge.&nbsp; A client should attempt to fulfill one of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; challenges, and a server should consider any one of the challenges<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sufficient to make the authorization valid.<br><br>This leaves me slightly confused.&nbsp; A final authorization can have multiple<br>challenges.&nbsp; But a client should only attempt to fulfill one, and a server<br>should treat any one as sufficient.&nbsp; So I can only get to the case with<br>multiple challenges present in a final order of both "should"s are<br>violated?&nbsp; Is there a way for the server to express that multiple<br>challenges are going to be required?<br>Hmm, but Section 7.1.6's flow chart for Authorization objects says that a<br>single challenge's transition to valid also makes the authorization<br>transition to valid, which would seem to close the window?<br>Section 7.5.1 has inline text that implicitly assumes that only one<br>challenge will be completed/validated.<br><br>&nbsp;  wildcard (optional, boolean):&nbsp; For authorizations created as a result<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of a newOrder request containing a DNS identifier with a value<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that contained a wildcard prefix this field MUST be present, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; true.<br><br>Is there a difference between false and absent?<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A client creates a new account with the server by sending a POST<br>&nbsp;  request to the server's new-account URL.&nbsp; The body of the request is<br>&nbsp;  a stub account object optionally containing the "contact" and<br>&nbsp;  "termsOfServiceAgreed" fields.<br><br>Given that we go on to describe those two and also the optional<br>onlyReturnExisting and externalAccountBinding fields, does this list need<br>expanding?<br><br>IMPORTANT: How does the client know if a termsOfService in the directory is<br>actually required or just optional?&nbsp; (There doesn't seem to be a dedicated<br>error type for this?)&nbsp; The text as-is seems to only say that if the server<br>requires it, the field must be present in the directory, but not the other<br>way around.&nbsp; I guess Section 7.3.4 describes the procedure for a similar<br>case; should the same thing happen for the original terms acceptance?<br><br>IMPORTANT: The example response uses what appears to be a sequential<br>counter for account ID in the returned account URL, which loses any sort of<br>security-through-obscurity protections if those were desired.&nbsp; Should a<br>more opaque URL component be present, maybe a UUID?&nbsp; (The "orders" field<br>would need to be modified accordingly, of course, and this pattern appears<br>in later examples, as well.)<br><br>Section 7.3.2<br><br>It's a little unclear to me whether the fields the client can put in the<br>POST are the ones listed from Section 7.3 or 7.1.2, or the full set from<br>the registry.&nbsp; But presumably the server must ignore the "status" field,<br>too, or at least some values should be disallowed!&nbsp; The IANA registry's<br>"configurable" column may not quite be the right thing for this usage,<br>especially given how account deactivation works.<br><br>Section 7.3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The server MAY require a value for the "externalAccountBinding" field<br>&nbsp;  to be present in "newAccount" requests.<br><br>All requests including queries for the current status and modification of<br>existing accounts?&nbsp; Or just creation of new ones?<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable ACME account binding, the CA operating the ACME server<br>&nbsp;  needs to provide the ACME client with a MAC key and a key identifier,<br>&nbsp;  using some mechanism outside of ACME.<br><br>This key needs to also be tied to the external account in question, right?<br>One might even say that it is provided not to the ACME client, but to the<br>external account holder, who is also running an ACME client.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] The payload of<br>&nbsp;  this JWS is the account key being registered, in JWK form.<br><br>This is presumably my fault and not the document's, but I had to read this<br>a few time to bind it as the ACME account key, and not the external MAC<br>key.<br><br>&nbsp;  If a CA requires that new-account requests contain an<br>&nbsp;  "externalAccountBinding" field, then it MUST provide the value "true"<br>&nbsp;  in the "externalAccountRequired" subfield of the "meta" field in the<br>&nbsp;  directory object.&nbsp; If the CA receives a new-account request without [...]<br><br>nit: maybe "If such a CA"?<br><br>IMPORTANT: I don't think I understand why "nonce" MUST NOT be present in<br>the external-binding JWS object, though I think I understand why one is not<br>needed in order to bind the MAC to the current transaction.&nbsp; (That is, this<br>is in effect a "triply nested" construct, where a standalone MAC that<br>certifies an ACME account (public) key as being authorized by the<br>external-account holder to act on behal of that external account.&nbsp; But this<br>standalone MAC will only be accepted by the ACME server in the context of<br>the outer JWS POST, that must be signed by the ACME account key, which is<br>assumed to be kept secure by the ACME client, ensuring that both<br>key-holding entities agree to the account linkage.)&nbsp; Proof of freshness of<br>the commitment from the external account holder to authorize the ACME<br>account key would only be needed if there was a scenario where the external<br>account holder would revoke that association, which does not seem to be a<br>workflow supported by this document.&nbsp; Any need to effectuate such a<br>revocation seems like it would involve issuing a new MAC key for the<br>external account (and invalidating the old one), and revoking/deactivating<br>the ACME account, which is a somewhat heavy hammer but perhaps reasonable<br>for such a scenario.<br>Account key rollover just says that the nonce is NOT REQUIRED, and also<br>uses some nicer (to me) language about "outer JWS" and "inner JWS".&nbsp; It<br>might be nice to synchronize these two sections.<br><br>Section 7.3.7<br><br>IMPORTANT: The "url" in this example looks like an account URL, not an<br>account-deactivation url.&nbsp; If they are one and the same, please include<br>some body text to this effect as is done for account update in Section<br>7.3.2.<br><br>Section 7.4<br><br>Is Section 7.1.3 or the registry a better reference for the request<br>payload's fields?<br><br>Does the exact-match policy (e.g., on notBefore and notAfter) result in CA<br>maximum lifetime policies needing to be hardcoded in client software (as<br>opposed to being discoverable at runtime)?<br><br>(I like the order url in the example, "[...]/order/asdf".&nbsp; Not much entropy<br>though.)<br><br>IMPORTANT: Why does the example response include an identifier of<br><a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> that was not in the request?<br><br>Is the "order's requested identifiers appear in commonName or<br>subjectAltName" requirement an exclusive or?<br><br>After a valid request to finalize has been issued, are "pending" or "ready"<br>still valid statuses that could be returned for that order?<br><br>Section 7.4.1<br><br>Elsewhere when we list "identifier (required, object)" in a JWS payload we<br>also inline the "type" and "value" breakdown of the object.<br><br>How is "expires" set for this pre-authorization object?<br><br>We probably need a reference for "certificate chain as defined in TLS".<br><br>Section 7.5<br><br>"When a client receives an order from the server" is a bit jarring without<br>some additional context of "in a reply to a new-order request" or "an order<br>object" or similar.<br><br>Section 7.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  To do this, the client updates the authorization object received from<br>&nbsp;  the server by filling in any required information in the elements of<br>&nbsp;  the "challenges" dictionary.<br><br>"challenges" looks like an array of objects, not directly a dictionary with<br>elements within it.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>IMPORTANT: What do I do if I get a challenge object that has status "valid"<br>but also includes an "error" field?<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] A key authorization is a string that expresses<br>&nbsp;  a domain holder's authorization for a specified key to satisfy a<br>&nbsp;  specified challenge, [...]<br><br>I'm going to quibble with the language here and say that the<br>keyAuthorization string as defined does not express a specific<br>authorization for a specific challenge, since there is no signature<br>involved, and the JWK thumbprint is separable and can be attached to some<br>other token.&nbsp; (This may just be an editorial matter with no broader impact,<br>depending on how it's used.)&nbsp; One could perhaps argue that the mere<br>existence of the token constitutes an authorization for a specified key to<br>satisfy the challenge, since the token only gets generated upon receipt of<br>such an authorized request.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>I'm not sure that 4086 is a great cite, here.&nbsp; For example, in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> we<br>say that "TLS requires a [CSPRNG].&nbsp; In most case, the operating system<br>provides an appropriate facility [...] Should these prove unsatisfactory,<br>[<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>] provides guidance on the generation of random values."&nbsp; On the<br>other hand, citing 4086 like this is not wrong, so use your judgment.<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; Verify that the body of the response is well-formed key<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authorization.&nbsp; The server SHOULD ignore whitespace characters at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the end of the body.<br><br>nit: "a well-formed"<br><br>Can we get some justification for the "SHOULD follow redirects", given the<br>security considerations surrounding doing so?<br><br>Section 8.4<br><br>Should this "token" description include the same text about entropy as for<br>the HTTP challenge?<br><br>Section 9.7.1<br><br>There is perhaps some subtlety here, in that the "configurable" column<br>applies only to the new-account request, but its description in the<br>template does not reflect that restriction.&nbsp; In particular, "status" values<br>from the client *are* accepted when posted to the account URL, e.g., for<br>account deactivation.<br><br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>Can there be overlap between the "validation server" function and the "ACME<br>client" function?<br><br>Section 10.2<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] The key authorization reflects the<br>&nbsp;  account public key, is provided to the server in the validation<br>&nbsp;  response over the validation channel and signed afterwards by the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding private key in the challenge response over the ACME<br>&nbsp;  channel.<br><br>I'm stumbling up around the comma trying to parse this sentence.&nbsp; (Maybe a<br>serial comma or using "and is signed" would help?)<br>IMPORTANT: Also, I don't see where the key authorization is signed in the<br>challenge response -- the payload is just an empty object for both the HTTP<br>and DNS challenges' responses.<br><br>Some of this text sounds like we're implicitly placing requirements on all<br>(HTTP|DNS) server operators (not just ones trying to use ACME) to mitgate<br>the risks being described.&nbsp; In general this sort of behavior seems like an<br>anti-design-pattern, though perhaps one could argue that the behaviors in<br>question should be avoided in general, indepnedent of ACME.<br><br>Section 10.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Some server implementations include information from the validation<br>&nbsp;  server's response (in order to facilitate debugging).&nbsp; Such<br><br>Disambiguating "ACME server implementations" may help, since we talk about<br>other HTTP requests in the previous paragraph.<br><br>Section 11.1<br><br>IMPORTANT: This may be an appropriate place to recommend against reuse of<br>account keys, whether after an account gets deactivated or by cycling<br>through keys in a sequence of key-change operations (or otherwise).&nbsp; I<br>think there are some attack scenarios possible wherein (inner) JWS objects<br>could be replayed against a different account, if such key reuse occurs.<br><br>Section 11.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The http-01, and dns-01 validation methods mandate the usage of a<br><br>nit: spurious comma.<br><br>&nbsp;  [...] Secondly, the entropy requirement<br>&nbsp;  prevents ACME clients from implementing a "naive" validation server<br>&nbsp;  that automatically replies to challenges without participating in the<br>&nbsp;  creation of the initial authorization request.<br><br>IMPORTANT: I'm not sure I see how this applies to the HTTP mechanism --<br>couldn't you write a script to reply to .well-known/acme-challenge/<br>with . for a fixed key thumbprint?&nbsp; The validation<br>server would ned to know about the ACME account in question, but not about<br>any individual authorization request.</div></td>

Eric Rescorla is the responsible Area <br>&nbsp;  Director.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Certificates in PKI using X.509 (PKIX) are used for a number of<br>&nbsp;  purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of<br>&nbsp;  domain names.&nbsp; Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are<br>&nbsp;  trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately<br>&nbsp;  represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.&nbsp; Today, this<br>&nbsp;  verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes a protocol that a certification authority (CA) and<br>&nbsp;  an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and<br>&nbsp;  certificate issuance.&nbsp; The protocol also provides facilities for<br>&nbsp;  other certificate management functions, such as certificate<br>&nbsp;  revocation.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Review and Consensus<br>&nbsp;  This document represents the consensus of the ACME working group. The draft<br>&nbsp;  has been the main document of the group for the last two years, and has been<br>&nbsp;  through WGLC since February 2017. <br>&nbsp;  Much of the discussion since then has been feedback from commercial CAs <br>&nbsp;  about integrating the protocol with their processes. Several of them are now <br>&nbsp;  committed to deploy this protocol following publication.<br>&nbsp;  Most of the session in IETF 99 was devoted to verifying that there are no <br>&nbsp;  more open issues for this draft.<br><br>Intellectual Property<br>&nbsp;  The authors have stated that they do not have any IPR related to this <br>&nbsp;  document, and that they are not aware of any IPR claims made by others about <br>&nbsp;  the content of this document.<br><br>Other Points<br>&nbsp;  None<br>&nbsp;  </div></td>

Kathleen Moriarty is the responsible Area <br>&nbsp;  Director.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Certificates in PKI using X.509 (PKIX) are used for a number of<br>&nbsp;  purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of<br>&nbsp;  domain names.&nbsp; Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are<br>&nbsp;  trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately<br>&nbsp;  represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.&nbsp; Today, this<br>&nbsp;  verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes a protocol that a certification authority (CA) and<br>&nbsp;  an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and<br>&nbsp;  certificate issuance.&nbsp; The protocol also provides facilities for<br>&nbsp;  other certificate management functions, such as certificate<br>&nbsp;  revocation.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Review and Consensus<br>&nbsp;  This document represents the consensus of the ACME working group. The draft<br>&nbsp;  has been the main document of the group for the last two years, and has been<br>&nbsp;  through WGLC since February 2017. <br>&nbsp;  Much of the discussion since then has been feedback from commercial CAs <br>&nbsp;  about integrating the protocol with their processes. Several of them are now <br>&nbsp;  committed to deploy this protocol following publication.<br>&nbsp;  Most of the session in IETF 99 was devoted to verifying that there are no <br>&nbsp;  more open issues for this draft.<br><br>Intellectual Property<br>&nbsp;  The authors have stated that they do not have any IPR related to this <br>&nbsp;  document, and that they are not aware of any IPR claims made by others about <br>&nbsp;  the content of this document.<br><br>Other Points<br>&nbsp;  None<br>&nbsp;  </div></td>

Kathleen Moriarty is the responsible Area <br>&nbsp;  Director.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Certificates in PKI using X.509 (PKIX) are used for a number of<br>&nbsp;  purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of<br>&nbsp;  domain names.&nbsp; Thus, certificate authorities in the Web PKI are<br>&nbsp;  trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately<br>&nbsp;  represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.&nbsp; Today, this<br>&nbsp;  verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes a protocol that a certification authority (CA) and<br>&nbsp;  an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and<br>&nbsp;  certificate issuance.&nbsp; The protocol also provides facilities for<br>&nbsp;  other certificate management functions, such as certificate<br>&nbsp;  revocation.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Review and Consensus<br>&nbsp;  This document represents the consensus of the ACME working group. The draft<br>&nbsp;  has been the main document of the group for the last two years, and has been<br>&nbsp;  through WGLC since February 2017. <br>&nbsp;  Much of the discussion since then has been feedback from commercial CAs <br>&nbsp;  about integrating the protocol with their processes.
