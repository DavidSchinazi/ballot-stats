As you may have noticed I had considerable difficulty with the definition of "cluster". Once I completed an end-to-end read-through, this was resolved (good!) but because RFCs are often consumed piecemeal (e.g. someone may just dip into a portion of a document rather than settling down with a nice cup of tea to read it end-to-end), I think it's important to fix this problem, on the assumption I'm not the only person who might be thrown off.<br><br>I'll leave the details in the COMMENT, but I will repeat one observation from my comment #3, which is that I count at least four separate (re-)definitions of "cluster" in the document. With so many, it's no wonder that they're inconsistent, and quite possibly the simplest solution would involve cutting the number of definitions down to as close to 1 as possible.<br><br>COMMENT:<br><br>1. In §1, this<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While this document and its Clustered<br>&nbsp;  Alternate-Marking method is valid for multipoint-to-multipoint<br>&nbsp;  unicast flows, anycast, and ECMP flows.<br>&nbsp;  <br>This is a sentence fragment (a naked subordinate clause). I'd suggest a rewrite but I can't make out what you are trying to say.<br><br>2. You have multiple definitions of "cluster" in the document, it seems. In §2 you have,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>As we have discussed in the past, according to this definition, a cluster is always a single router. I think in an earlier discussion you suggested that it could be corrected by saying something like "smallest subnetwork larger than a singleton router", which I think would work, "smallest non-trivial" would too (although it's less explicit). But then in §5 you have,<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, it is also possible to leverage the data provided by the<br>&nbsp;  other counters in the network to converge on the smallest<br>&nbsp;  identifiable subnetworks where the losses occur.&nbsp; These subnetworks<br>&nbsp;  are named "clusters".<br><br>As written, this makes nonzero losses a definitional attribute of a cluster. Now that I've taken in the entire document, I guess this is the incorrect definition. Possibly a fix would be to just drop the final sentence, which (incorrectly?) implies that losses are an essential element of the definition.<br><br>For what it's worth, the algorithm of Section 5.1 is perfectly clear. I see the desire to have a prose description of what a cluster is trying to do, but I wonder if in the end it would be best to make the algorithm the canonical definition, referenced from the prose definition as in <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable non-trivial <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm, such as that found in Section 5.1,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>3. In §5, you have<br><br>&nbsp;  A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network<br>&nbsp;  graph that still satisfies the packet loss equation (introduced in<br>&nbsp;  the previous section), where PL in this case is the number of packets<br>&nbsp;  lost in the cluster.<br><br>I'd previously pointed out that this is problematic since the PL equation you mention is in the nature of a definition; since you don't supply a condition there's no way of saying whether it's "satisfied" or not. In response you said (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/</a>),<br><br>```<br>We can modify the wording in Section 5 accordingly:<br><br>"A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out, if no packet loss occurs."<br><br>```<br><br>If indeed that is the right definition (see my earlier point, so probably inserting "non-trivial" or "with more than a single router") then I do think you should make that change, or in any case you should correct the current text somehow.<br><br>By the way, do you mean something subtly different by "cluster graph" than you do by "cluster"? Or do you just mean "the graph that represents the cluster"? I think my confusion over just what a "cluster" is would have been mitigated by fewer re-definitions of it. If "cluster graph" is indeed just another way of saying "cluster" it's the third of four definitions! (The two I mention in my point #2, this one, and the algorithm in Section 5.1.) With four definitions of the same thing, in different words, no wonder some inconsistency crept in!<br><br>4. In §5.1,<br><br>&nbsp;  In summary, once a flow is defined, the algorithm to build the<br>&nbsp;  clusters partition is based on topological information; therefore, it<br>&nbsp;  considers all the possible links and nodes crossed by the given flow,<br>&nbsp;  even if there is no traffic.<br>&nbsp;  <br>If a flow has no traffic, can we call it a flow? It seems counter to the normal English meaning of the word. Perhaps you mean possible links and nodes that could potentially be crossed by the given flow?<br><br>5. Thanks for reporting the outcome of the earlier experiment, in §9. As with my review of rfc8321bis, I think the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords need to be in a "Deployment Considerations" section or similar, which could be achieved by retitling this section or by separating the material into reporting the experiment outcome (this section) and a new subsection for deployment advice.<br><br>6. Again similarly to my review of the companion document, I think §9's "the Multipoint Alternate Marking Method is RECOMMENDED only for controlled domains" needs to be fixed. Please bring it into line with whatever language you choose for rfc8321bis.<br><br><br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>7. While the reference tags are in principle arbitrary strings, I wondered if it was a typo that you used "PNPM" to tag a paper titled "AM-PM"?<br><br>8. In §7.1.1,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This means that, in the calculation, it is possible to<br>&nbsp;  weigh the timestamps by considering the number of packets for each<br>&nbsp;  endpoints.<br>&nbsp;  <br>s/endpoints/endpoint/</div></td>

May be it is my lack of expertise in English language or the technology used here but when the definition of flow is defined by flow ( is says- a flow can be multipoint-to-multipoint flow) it becomes very difficult to understand.

I'd suggest a rewrite but I can't make out what you are trying to say.<br><br>2. You have multiple definitions of "cluster" in the document, it seems. In §2 you have,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>As we have discussed in the past, according to this definition, a cluster is always a single router. I think in an earlier discussion you suggested that it could be corrected by saying something like "smallest subnetwork larger than a singleton router", which I think would work, "smallest non-trivial" would too (although it's less explicit). But then in §5 you have,<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, it is also possible to leverage the data provided by the<br>&nbsp;  other counters in the network to converge on the smallest<br>&nbsp;  identifiable subnetworks where the losses occur.&nbsp; These subnetworks<br>&nbsp;  are named "clusters".<br><br>As written, this makes nonzero losses a definitional attribute of a cluster. Now that I've taken in the entire document, I guess this is the incorrect definition. Possibly a fix would be to just drop the final sentence, which (incorrectly?) implies that losses are an essential element of the definition.<br><br>For what it's worth, the algorithm of Section 5.1 is perfectly clear. I see the desire to have a prose description of what a cluster is trying to do, but I wonder if in the end it would be best to make the algorithm the canonical definition, referenced from the prose definition as in <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable non-trivial <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm, such as that found in Section 5.1,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>3. In §5, you have<br><br>&nbsp;  A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network<br>&nbsp;  graph that still satisfies the packet loss equation (introduced in<br>&nbsp;  the previous section), where PL in this case is the number of packets<br>&nbsp;  lost in the cluster.<br><br>I'd previously pointed out that this is problematic since the PL equation you mention is in the nature of a definition; since you don't supply a condition there's no way of saying whether it's "satisfied" or not. In response you said (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/</a>),<br><br>```<br>We can modify the wording in Section 5 accordingly:<br><br>"A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out, if no packet loss occurs."<br><br>```<br><br>If indeed that is the right definition (see my earlier point, so probably inserting "non-trivial" or "with more than a single router") then I do think you should make that change, or in any case you should correct the current text somehow.<br><br>By the way, do you mean something subtly different by "cluster graph" than you do by "cluster"? Or do you just mean "the graph that represents the cluster"? I think my confusion over just what a "cluster" is would have been mitigated by fewer re-definitions of it. If "cluster graph" is indeed just another way of saying "cluster" it's the third of four definitions! (The two I mention in my point #2, this one, and the algorithm in Section 5.1.) With four definitions of the same thing, in different words, no wonder some inconsistency crept in!<br><br>4. In §5.1,<br><br>&nbsp;  In summary, once a flow is defined, the algorithm to build the<br>&nbsp;  clusters partition is based on topological information; therefore, it<br>&nbsp;  considers all the possible links and nodes crossed by the given flow,<br>&nbsp;  even if there is no traffic.<br>&nbsp;  <br>If a flow has no traffic, can we call it a flow? It seems counter to the normal English meaning of the word. Perhaps you mean possible links and nodes that could potentially be crossed by the given flow?<br><br>5. Thanks for reporting the outcome of the earlier experiment, in §9. As with my review of rfc8321bis, I think the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords need to be in a "Deployment Considerations" section or similar, which could be achieved by retitling this section or by separating the material into reporting the experiment outcome (this section) and a new subsection for deployment advice.<br><br>6. Again similarly to my review of the companion document, I think §9's "the Multipoint Alternate Marking Method is RECOMMENDED only for controlled domains" needs to be fixed. Please bring it into line with whatever language you choose for rfc8321bis.<br><br><br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>7.

I think in an earlier discussion you suggested that it could be corrected by saying something like "smallest subnetwork larger than a singleton router", which I think would work, "smallest non-trivial" would too (although it's less explicit). But then in §5 you have,<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, it is also possible to leverage the data provided by the<br>&nbsp;  other counters in the network to converge on the smallest<br>&nbsp;  identifiable subnetworks where the losses occur.&nbsp; These subnetworks<br>&nbsp;  are named "clusters".<br><br>As written, this makes nonzero losses a definitional attribute of a cluster. Now that I've taken in the entire document, I guess this is the incorrect definition. Possibly a fix would be to just drop the final sentence, which (incorrectly?) implies that losses are an essential element of the definition.<br><br>For what it's worth, the algorithm of Section 5.1 is perfectly clear. I see the desire to have a prose description of what a cluster is trying to do, but I wonder if in the end it would be best to make the algorithm the canonical definition, referenced from the prose definition as in <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable non-trivial <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm, such as that found in Section 5.1,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>3. In §5, you have<br><br>&nbsp;  A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network<br>&nbsp;  graph that still satisfies the packet loss equation (introduced in<br>&nbsp;  the previous section), where PL in this case is the number of packets<br>&nbsp;  lost in the cluster.<br><br>I'd previously pointed out that this is problematic since the PL equation you mention is in the nature of a definition; since you don't supply a condition there's no way of saying whether it's "satisfied" or not. In response you said (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ippm/iXSBuXrQaETl6MyeDH8DBaPiJ9Q/</a>),<br><br>```<br>We can modify the wording in Section 5 accordingly:<br><br>"A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out, if no packet loss occurs."<br><br>```<br><br>If indeed that is the right definition (see my earlier point, so probably inserting "non-trivial" or "with more than a single router") then I do think you should make that change, or in any case you should correct the current text somehow.<br><br>By the way, do you mean something subtly different by "cluster graph" than you do by "cluster"? Or do you just mean "the graph that represents the cluster"? I think my confusion over just what a "cluster" is would have been mitigated by fewer re-definitions of it. If "cluster graph" is indeed just another way of saying "cluster" it's the third of four definitions! (The two I mention in my point #2, this one, and the algorithm in Section 5.1.) With four definitions of the same thing, in different words, no wonder some inconsistency crept in!<br><br>4. In §5.1,<br><br>&nbsp;  In summary, once a flow is defined, the algorithm to build the<br>&nbsp;  clusters partition is based on topological information; therefore, it<br>&nbsp;  considers all the possible links and nodes crossed by the given flow,<br>&nbsp;  even if there is no traffic.<br>&nbsp;  <br>If a flow has no traffic, can we call it a flow? It seems counter to the normal English meaning of the word. Perhaps you mean possible links and nodes that could potentially be crossed by the given flow?<br><br>5.

As with my review of rfc8321bis, I think the <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords need to be in a "Deployment Considerations" section or similar, which could be achieved by retitling this section or by separating the material into reporting the experiment outcome (this section) and a new subsection for deployment advice.<br><br>6.

I'd suggest a rewrite but I can't make out what you are trying to say.<br><br>2. You have two different definitions of "cluster" in the document, it seems. In §2 you have,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>As we have discussed in the past, according to this definition, a cluster is always a single router. I think in an earlier discussion you suggested that it could be corrected by saying something like "smallest subnetwork larger than a singleton router", which I think would work, "smallest non-trivial" would too (although it's less explicit). But then in §5 you have,<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, it is also possible to leverage the data provided by the<br>&nbsp;  other counters in the network to converge on the smallest<br>&nbsp;  identifiable subnetworks where the losses occur.&nbsp; These subnetworks<br>&nbsp;  are named "clusters".<br><br>As written, this makes nonzero losses a definitional attribute of a cluster. Now that I've taken in the entire document, I guess this is the incorrect definition. Possibly a fix would be to just drop the final sentence, which (incorrectly?) implies that losses are an essential element of the definition.<br><br>For what it's worth, the algorithm of Section 5.1 is perfectly clear. I see the desire to have a prose description of what a cluster is trying to do, but I wonder if in the end it would be best to make the algorithm the canonical definition, referenced from the prose definition as in <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster: Smallest identifiable non-trivial <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; subnetwork of the entire monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network graph that still satisfies the condition that the number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of packets that go in is the same as the number that go out.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cluster partition algorithm, such as that found in Section 5.1,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can be applied to split the monitoring<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network into clusters.<br><br>3. In §5, you have<br><br>&nbsp;  A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network<br>&nbsp;  graph that still satisfies the packet loss equation (introduced in<br>&nbsp;  the previous section), where PL in this case is the number of packets<br>&nbsp;  lost in the cluster.<br><br>I'd previously pointed out that this is problematic since the PL equation you mention is in the nature of a definition; since you don't supply a condition there's no way of saying whether it's "satisfied" or not.

Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this writeup to give helpful context to Last Call and<br>Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your diligence in<br>completing it, is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>This is small bis update we took through the WG quickly. It had clear consensus, with  about 1/3-1/2 of the active WG chiming in. Both RFC8321bis and RFC8889bis are<br>being taken through the process together.<br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>There was no controversy in these updates within the WG.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No appeals threatened.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Our adoption call of the -bis document raised the question of implementations,<br>and several implementations were discussed on the mailing list.<br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br><br>This -bis effort was spurred on by <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark/">draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark</a>, which normatively<br>references the work. Authors are participants of both WGs, and that WG is aware of this work.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal review needed.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>No YANG model.<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes, I think these documents are ready to progress.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>I do not believe this document requires further area reviews.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Proposed Standard. The point of this bis effort is to move from Experimental<br>to Proposed Standard.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>Yes, IPR is filed for both RFC8321bis and RFC8889bis, which is just a carry-over<br>of the existing IPR on the original <a href="/doc/rfc8321/">RFC8321</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a> documents.<br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>Both documents have 5 authors each, and all authors were involved with the<br>original RFCs.<br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>Nits for RFC8889bis:<br><br>&nbsp; ** The abstract seems to contain references ([<a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a>]), which it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  shouldn't.&nbsp; Please replace those with straight textual mentions of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  documents in question.<br><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC 5474</a><br><br>&nbsp; == Outdated reference: <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-route/">draft-ietf-ippm-route</a> has been published as <a href="/doc/rfc9198/">RFC 9198</a><br><br>These items should be addressed by making the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a> in the<br>abstract textual as suggesting, making the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> informative,<br>and referring to <a href="/doc/rfc9198/">RFC9198</a>.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>For RFC8889bis: the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> should become informative.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>All references are available.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>For RFC8889bis: Currently <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> is such, but I believe that should change.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>Yes, RFC8889bis obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a>, as described in the abstract.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.

Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this writeup to give helpful context to Last Call and<br>Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your diligence in<br>completing it, is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>This is small bis update we took through the WG quickly. It had clear consensus, with  about 1/3-1/2 of the active WG chiming in. Both RFC8321bis and RFC8889bis are<br>being taken through the process together.<br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>There was no controversy in these updates within the WG.<br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No appeals threatened.<br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>Our adoption call of the -bis document raised the question of implementations,<br>and several implementations were discussed on the mailing list.<br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br><br>This -bis effort was spurred on by <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark/">draft-ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark</a>, which normatively<br>references the work. Authors are participants of both WGs, and that WG is aware of this work.<br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal review needed.<br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>No YANG model.<br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>Not applicable.<br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>Yes, I think these documents are ready to progress.<br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>I do not believe this document requires further area reviews.<br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>Proposed Standard. The point of this bis effort is to move from Experimental<br>to Proposed Standard.<br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>Yes, IPR is filed for both RFC8321bis and RFC8889bis, which is just a carry-over<br>of the existing IPR on the original <a href="/doc/rfc8321/">RFC8321</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a> documents.<br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>Both documents have 5 authors each, and all authors were involved with the<br>original RFCs.<br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>Nits for RFC8889bis:<br><br>&nbsp; ** The abstract seems to contain references ([<a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a>]), which it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  shouldn't.&nbsp; Please replace those with straight textual mentions of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  documents in question.<br><br>&nbsp; ** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC 5474</a><br><br>&nbsp; == Outdated reference: <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ippm-route/">draft-ietf-ippm-route</a> has been published as <a href="/doc/rfc9198/">RFC 9198</a><br><br>These items should be addressed by making the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a> in the<br>abstract textual as suggesting, making the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> informative,<br>and referring to <a href="/doc/rfc9198/">RFC9198</a>.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>For RFC8889bis: the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> should become informative.<br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>All references are available.<br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>For RFC8889bis: Currently <a href="/doc/rfc5474/">RFC5474</a> is such, but I believe that should change.<br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>Yes, RFC8889bis obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8889/">RFC8889</a>, as described in the abstract.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>This document does not have IANA actions.<br><br>21.
