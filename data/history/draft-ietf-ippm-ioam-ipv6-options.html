There remain a few comments that weren't addressed in versions 10 or 11 nor responded to in email, please forgive me if I've missed a response. I repeat the comments below, with section numbers updated to match the numbering in versions 10 and 11.<br><br>### Section 3, reference for IOAM Type, nomenclature<br><br>```<br>IOAM Type: 8-bit field as defined in section 7.1 in [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>Section 7.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> is the IOAM Option-Type Registry in the IANA Considerations section. I wouldn't say an IANA registry "defines" anything, it lists code points. I think a better reference would be Section 4 of 9197, which does indeed define IOAM-Option-Types (in Section 4.1). <br><br>Also, it would be better to be consistent with your naming, in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> you don't call this the "IOAM Type" but rather the "IOAM-Option-Type" (34 occurrences in 9197) or "IOAM Option-Type" without the first hyphen (4 occurrences in 9197). I see why you don't want to use the full string from <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> in your packet diagram (too many characters) but "IOAM-Opt-Type" would fit in the character budget.<br><br>### Section 4.2, encapsulation?<br><br>```<br>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and decapsulation.<br>```<br><br>Do you intend to imply that the hosts at the edge of the domain are sending IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated data? It wouldn't seem to be required; since the hosts are the source/sink of the packets, the problem described in C6 doesn't apply, and the host can directly place the IOAM data in the header. (What would be the "inner header" in an overlay solution.) <br><br>I suppose it's technically accurate to describe this as an "encapsulation and decapsulation" operation, insofar as any data placed in any header might be said to be encapsulated in that header -- but it's misleading.

I'm so sorry to have to raise another one, related to the new text. <br><br>&nbsp;  C1&nbsp; IOAM MUST be deployed as a limited domain feature as defined in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc8799/">RFC8799</a>].<br><br>I applaud your desire to be prescriptive and concise. Unfortunately, I think there are a few problems here. First the small ones: you have <a href="/doc/rfc8799/">RFC 8799</a> as an Informative reference, which is problematic since you want to make adherence to it mandatory. But, if you move it to be a Normative reference (as seems indicated), then we encounter two further issues: first and less importantly, it’s not an IETF document, so possibly needs to be treated as a downref? <br><br>But most importantly, as far as I can tell <a href="/doc/rfc8799/">RFC 8799</a> does not define “a limited domain feature”. It provides a taxonomy for talking about limited domains and various considerations, but nothing I would call a “definition”. I confess I’ve only briefly reviewed 8799 just now, not fully re-read it, so maybe you will be able to point me to a clear and actionable definition, that an implementor of your spec could apply in order to comply with C1. If so, please do let me know what that definition is, and also update your reference to cite it specifically, rather than just the RFC number. In my own review of 8799, the closest I see is Section 6, "Functional Requirements of Limited Domains”. I will be a little surprised if you really want to require adherence requirements 1-11 in that section, though.<br><br>Sadly, I suspect that you’ll end up concluding that <a href="/doc/rfc8799/">RFC 8799</a> isn’t fit for the purpose you’re trying to use it for and that you’ll need to write out in your own words what the specific requirements are for your case. It looks to me as though the taxonomy section of <a href="/doc/rfc8799/">RFC 8799</a> might be quite useful to you in that respect, indeed that seems to be partly what it’s for:<br><br>```<br>A.9. Making Use of This Taxonomy<br><br>This taxonomy could be used to design or analyze a specific type of limited domain.<br>```<br><br>It’s unfortunate that we don’t have a good, citable definition of “limited domain” in our document set... but we don’t. This might be merely because nobody has bothered to write it yet, although I think the real reason is more likely that it turns out to be a sticky problem to nail it down to a definition that is both general enough to be broadly applicable and specific enough to be actionable.</div></td>

A few appear not to have been addressed in version 10 nor responded to in email, please forgive me if I've missed a response. I repeat the comments below, with section numbers updated to match the numbering in version 10.<br><br>### Section 3, reference for IOAM Type, nomenclature<br><br>```<br>IOAM Type: 8-bit field as defined in section 7.1 in [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>Section 7.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> is the IOAM Option-Type Registry in the IANA Considerations section. I wouldn't say an IANA registry "defines" anything, it lists code points. I think a better reference would be Section 4 of 9197, which does indeed define IOAM-Option-Types (in Section 4.1). <br><br>Also, it would be better to be consistent with your naming, in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> you don't call this the "IOAM Type" but rather the "IOAM-Option-Type" (34 occurrences in 9197) or "IOAM Option-Type" without the first hyphen (4 occurrences in 9197). I see why you don't want to use the full string from <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> in your packet diagram (too many characters) but "IOAM-Opt-Type" would fit in the character budget.<br><br>### Section 4.2, encapsulation?<br><br>```<br>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and decapsulation.<br>```<br><br>Do you intend to imply that the hosts at the edge of the domain are sending IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated data? It wouldn't seem to be required; since the hosts are the source/sink of the packets, the problem described in C6 doesn't apply, and the host can directly place the IOAM data in the header. (What would be the "inner header" in an overlay solution.) <br><br>I suppose it's technically accurate to describe this as an "encapsulation and decapsulation" operation, insofar as any data placed in any header might be said to be encapsulated in that header -- but it's misleading. I think this section needs to be rewritten to make the meaning plain. For example, something like "... hosts will place the IOAM data field directly in the IPv6 header." (You could say "outer IPv6 header" since there's nothing precluding a host from sending tunneled packets for some purpose.)<br><br>(I notice Éric Vyncke raises a similar concern about the nontraditional use of the term "encapsulation" in his comments.)<br><br>### Section 4.3, encapsulation again<br><br>This one is less misleading, but by analogy to 4.2 I suspect more clarity is required here too. <br><br>```<br>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices, network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain.

Basically - I see a situation where that could lead to undefined behavior that always makes me nervous. <br><br>Could the authors, therefore, expand slightly on how the destination option is handled in the context of SRv6 and its various flavors?</div></td>

My views align very strongly with John Scudder's, but seeing as he is already carrying the DISCUSS, I'm going to cowardly abstain and hide behind him.<br><br>The document feels like it is creating something very similar to a "limited domain"; the reason that I'm not balloting DISCUSS is that the document "feels" like it is trying to minimize the damage when IOAM packets do leak. This includes "failing closed" ('IOAM MUST be explicitly enabled per interface on every node within the IOAM domain'). I am, however, quite troubled by the "As additional security, IOAM domains MUST provide a mechanism to prevent unauthorized injections at ingress or leaks at egress." without actually stating how this would be performed.<br><br>The fact that the IOAM data is information (it doesn't obfuscate the source of the traffic, nor (hopefully!) change routing / forwarding) also helps push this from DISCUSS to Abstain for me - when a domain *does* leak packets with IOAM info, they will either exceed the MTU and so be dropped, or will "just" be leaking traffic stats from that domain, and should otherwise be forwarded OK.<br><br>There are some Considerations in Sec 5 which I think are unrealistic, but not harmful - for example:<br>* I suspect that in some cases adding IOAM will change ECMP hashing (C1);<br>* they *will* leak (C3), but this shouldn't break things; <br>* they *will* leak (C4), but I suspect that external devices will simply ignore the EH header;<br><br><br>I have a horrible feeling that I'm being inconsistent with my balloting: normally I would ballot DISCUSS on documents which either add information to an in-flight packet, or which create any sort of closed domain, but in this case I feel that the document has sufficiently attempted to mitigate the (external) consequences of leaks that I'm choosing Abstain instead.</div></td>

If so, please say so. (If not, let's discuss.)<br><br>### Section 4, reference for IOAM Type, nomenclature<br><br>```<br>IOAM Type: 8-bit field as defined in section 7.1 in [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>].<br>```<br><br>Section 7.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> is the IOAM Option-Type Registry in the IANA Considerations section. I wouldn't say an IANA registry "defines" anything, it lists code points. I think a better reference would be Section 4 of 9197, which does indeed define IOAM-Option-Types (in Section 4.1). <br><br>Also, it would be better to be consistent with your naming, in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> you don't call this the "IOAM Type" but rather the "IOAM-Option-Type" (34 occurrences in 9197) or "IOAM Option-Type" without the first hyphen (4 occurrences in 9197). I see why you don't want to use the full string from <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> in your packet diagram (too many characters) but "IOAM-Opt-Type" would fit in the character budget.<br><br>### Section 4, Trace-Type constraints<br><br>```<br>In addition, to maintain IPv6 extension header 8-octet alignment and avoid the need to add or remove padding at every hop, the Trace-Type for Incremental Trace Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data length is a multiple of 8-octets.<br>```<br><br>I spent some time trying to understand exactly what it means for the Trace-Type to be selected such that, etc. I suppose this isn't too complicated in the end, since all the types defined in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> are either four- or eight-byte fields. I don't see an explicit pad field being defined, though, so I wonder if it would be a helpful hint to note that the Opaque State Snapshot with Length 0 and Schema ID 0xFFFFFF can be used as a four-octet pad if needed. I see you use 0xFFFFFFFF as a pad in some places in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>, but there's no corresponding Trace-Type and it doesn't seem prudent to just poach a currently undefined bit to indicate the pad. I guess the other alternative would be to allocate a new Trace-Type bit to explicitly indicate a four-byte pad field, but given you can use Opaque State for this purpose, I don't see why you'd burn the bit.<br><br>Anyway, if I've missed some explicit way eight-byte alignment is supported in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a>, please point it out to me? Otherwise, I think you need to be clearer about this, to discourage implementors from exercising "creativity".<br><br>### Section 5.1, C3, entities that communicate the errors<br><br>```<br>The entities that communicate the errors to devices outside of the IOAM domain MUST remove any IOAM data from the packet included in the error message<br>```<br><br>This is quite non-specific. Who are “the entities“ in this context? The host or router that originates the ICMP report? The router that forwards it outside the domain? If the former, I guess that means every entity within the domain that might originate an ICMP message has to know a priori if it's sending its message to an internal or external recipient. If the latter, that's a notable new requirement on border routers.<br><br>### Section 5.1, C4 violates closed domain<br><br>```<br>OAM data leaks can affect the forwarding behavior and state of network elements outside an IOAM domain. IOAM domains MUST provide a mechanism to prevent data leaks or be able to ensure that if a leak occurs, network elements outside the domain are not affected (i.e., they continue to process other valid packets).<br>```<br><br>I have a few difficulties with C4. Among them --<br><br>- The first sentence is quite nonspecific, I don't know if you have some actual failure modes in mind but I suppose you must. Can you elucidate?<br>- The second sentence, starting with "or", appears to violate the limited domain assumption, or at the least, it introduces a creative understanding of it ("go ahead and leak as long as you're sure the leaks are fine").<br>- I don't understand how an operator could possibly fulfill the "or" clause with confidence since by definition whatever is happening outside the border of the limited domain is not under the control of, or even necessarily known to, the operator.<br><br>My guess is that you're trying to motivate the ULA deployment option here, without talking about it specifically. Is that right?<br><br>### Section 5.1, C6 is inaccurate<br><br>```<br>Compliance with [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>] requires OAM data to be encapsulated instead of header/option insertion directly into in-flight packets using the original IPv6 header.<br>```<br><br>I don't think you mean the OAM data (by which I think you mean IOAM data) needs to be encapsulated, but rather that it needs to be within an encapsulation header? That's what's implied by your Deployment Options section, anyway. If so, please say so, if not, let's discuss.<br><br>Assuming I've guessed correctly, a possible rewrite could look something like<br><br>```<br>[<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>] precludes insertion of IOAM data directly into the original IPv6 header of in-flight packets. Therefore, in order to add IOAM data, in-flight packets must be encapsulated in an outer header, and the IOAM data added to that header.<br>```<br><br>### Section 5.1, C7, wording<br><br>```<br>Hence when the IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type is used in the deployment the RemainingLen field of the option MUST follow the guidance in [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>] and must be computed and set appropriately.<br>```<br><br>I assume you mean "used in deployment" and didn't intend the definite article (which would imply you're talking about a specific deployment). But I think instead of just dropping "the", you might as well go ahead and drop "in the deployment" (where else is it going to be used after all, where this guidance wouldn't apply?).<br><br>### Section 5.1, C7, lack of specificity<br><br>```<br>The IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type expands the option length that may affect the processing of extension headers and options that follow IOAM options. Hence when the IOAM Incremental Trace Option-Type is used in the deployment the RemainingLen field of the option MUST follow the guidance in [<a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC9197</a>] and must be computed and set appropriately.<br>```<br><br>What guidance, exactly, is supposed to be followed? I dug around in <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> and the best guess I could come up with is<br><br>```<br>The sender MAY calculate the value of the RemainingLen field by computing the number of node data bytes allowed before exceeding the PMTU, given that the PMTU is known to the sender. <br>```<br><br>I'm not very happy with that guess, because it doesn't seem to be responsive to the problem you've posed. What I've quoted from <a href="/doc/rfc9197/">RFC 9197</a> is a way to avoid exceeding the PMTU, but in the present document you've posed the concern that if you shove too much data into the IOAM header, other extension headers may be ignored. That's not the same as PMTU, which relates to total packet size, not header options size. <br><br>Whatever it is you're trying to do here, I think you need to be more specific about it.<br><br>### Section 5.2, encapsulation?<br><br>```<br>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by hosts, hosts will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and decapsulation.<br>```<br><br>Do you intend to imply that the hosts at the edge of the domain are sending IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated data? It wouldn't seem to be required; since the hosts are the source/sink of the packets, the problem described in C6 doesn't apply, and the host can directly place the IOAM data in the header. (What would be the "inner header" in an overlay solution.) <br><br>I suppose it's technically accurate to describe this as an "encapsulation and decapsulation" operation, insofar as any data placed in any header might be said to be encapsulated in that header -- but it's misleading. I think this section needs to be rewritten to make the meaning plain. For example, something like "... hosts will place the IOAM data field directly in the IPv6 header." (You could say "outer IPv6 header" since there's nothing precluding a host from sending tunneled packets for some purpose.)<br><br>(I notice Éric Vyncke raises a similar concern about the nontraditional use of the term "encapsulation" in his comments.)<br><br>### Section 5.3, encapsulation again<br><br>This one is less misleading, but by analogy to 5.2 I suspect more clarity is required here too. <br><br>```<br>For deployments where the IOAM domain is bounded by network devices, network devices such as routers form the edge of an IOAM domain. Network devices will perform the operation of IOAM data field encapsulation and decapsulation.<br>```<br><br>For example, a more straightforwardly understandable version of the last sentence might be "Network devices will encapsulate in-flight packets in an outer IPv6 header which carries the IOAM data field."<br><br>### Section 5.4.1 infeasible requirement<br><br>```<br>Addressing and routing in the IOAM Overlay Network are to be configured so that the IP-in-IPv6 encapsulated packets follow the same path as the original, non-encapsulated packet would have taken.<br>```<br><br>This doesn't seem to be feasible in the face of ECMP. <br><br>### Section 5.4.2, wording<br><br>```<br>In this case IOAM can be encapsulated in as an extension header in the tunnel (outer) IPv6 header.<br>```<br><br>Is the "as" unintended in the quoted text? If so, please remove it, if not, I don't understand the meaning.<br><br>## NITS<br><br>### Section 5.1<br><br>"if IOAM is used in in transit devices" <br><br>s/in in/in/<br><br>### Section 5.4<br><br>"This section lists out"<br><br>Just "lists", no "out".<br><br>### 5.4.1<br><br>"almost close to zero"<br><br>I assume you mean either "almost zero" or "close to zero". Because as written, I would parse "almost close to zero" as "not close to zero" which is probably not what you're going for. <br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

Is it "option data" as in the diagram below ? Or is it the option fields of HbH &amp; DO as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>.<br><br>Does every interface really need to be IOAM enabled ? It seems that not enabling on interface will only degrade the collected information but would still be useful.<br><br>`a router MUST ignore IOAM Options` what about a host (i.e., not a router) receiving a packet with a destination option containing an IOAM option ?<br><br>The Reserved field must be set to 0 on transmission, does it include also when it is received in HbH ? I.e., then re-transmitted to the next node ? Suggest to use "set to 0 by the source".<br><br>### Section 5.1<br><br>To be honest, I was about to mark those comments as blocking discuss points.<br><br>In C1:<br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Implementations of IOAM SHOULD ensure that ECMP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behavior for packets with and without IOAM data fields is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; same.<br>```<br>What about non-IOAM-aware routers (or even not routers like LACP bundles)? Is it the reason why all routers need to support IOAM as specified in section 4 ?<br><br>In C2: `which is intended to support hardware implementations of IOAM, ` seems weird. Is it about "which is intended to be used only by hardware-supported implementation" ?<br><br>In C3, I am afraid that I cannot really parse this consideration. E.g., what is meant by "associated ICMP errors" ? Is it ICMP packet generated by an IOAM-domain router containing IOAM options (my guess) ? If the original packet is encapsulated (per the rest of this I-D), how could an ICMP sent back to the encapsulating node be sent further once decapsulated ? <br><br>C4, does "data leak" means a "packet with IOAM data leaking outside of the IOAM domain" ?<br><br>Unsure about the usefulness of C5.<br><br>### Section 5.2<br><br>The use of "encapsulation" and "decapsulation" appears weird in a host processing.<br><br>### Section 5.4<br><br>Should it be a sub-section of 5.3 ?

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard, this is appropriate since this describes a common deployment option of the IOAM proposed standard. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network. This document outlines how IOAM data fields are encapsulated in IPv6<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>To my knowledge the working group process has been fairly smooth and uncontroversial. The document was at first proposed to the 6man wokring group, but there it was decided that it would be more appropriate for ippm to take responsibility for it. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The specification has good implementation support, in particular it has been implemented in the Linux kernel. Asside from a few small nits the shepherd has no concerns with the document quality. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Shepherd: Marcus ihlar<br>Responsible AD: Martin Duke<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed this document as part of the shepherding process. Furthermore, this document has received substantial review as part of the working group process.<br>With the exception from a few small nits this document shoudld be ready for publication. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No, reviews have been recived by ippm participants and 6man participants. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No particular concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Waiting for one of the two authors to respond to this, but the current indication is that there are no more IPR declarations other than <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3529/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3529/</a>. <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There is one IPR disclosure (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3529/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3529/</a>) that references this document, it was done prior to WG adoption and I could not see much discussion about it. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There seems to be pretty solid consensus, there's quite a large set of contributors and some good feedback from the 6man wg has been considered. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.
