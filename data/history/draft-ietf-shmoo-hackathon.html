Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is intended to become an Informational RFC. It documents the experiences and the practices followed of running the IETF hackathon at IETF 108 onwards after recovering from a cancelled hackathon at IETF 107 due to the late move to a virtual meeting. Hence Informational seems to be the right classification for this. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>IETF Hackathons encourage the IETF community to collaborate on running code related to existing and evolving Internet standards. This document provides a set of practices that have been used for running IETF Hackathons. These practices apply to Hackathons in which both in-person and remote participation are possible with adaptations for Hackathons that are online only.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document was presented to shmoo early in the WG lifecycle where there was discussion on whether an RFC was the right mechanism to capture these experiences and practices and there was widespread agreement in the WG that it was. There was a lot of feedback on the draft both prior to its adoption as WG item as well as after. All issues brought up on the draft were tracked using an issue tracker on github and the shepherd has confirmed that these have been addressed in the latest version of the draft.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document has been presented several times to the working group and all the feedback received has been addressed in the latest revision. The document has received significant review from the WG before and after adoption and also during working group last call.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Mallory Knodel is the Document Shepherd. Lars Eggert is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>Charles has clearly documented the tried and true formula for the IETF Hackathon and it's a privilege to have this excellent work documented in the shmoo working group. It is within scope of the shmoo charter for the critical elements of remote participation in all meetings, including appropriate considerations for those that are online only. My review was for consistency of documentation only and to ensure there were no questions, gaps or confusing information. Charles has addressed all issues both on the list and in Github, and incorporated all PRs. With these minor changes, the document is certainly ready to progress towards publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No. Both of the WG chairs have reviewed multiple versions of the draft and are comfortable with the level of review this draft has received till date.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There is solid WG consensus behind this document. A large number of WG participants have expressed support for this draft and there has been no opposition to it progressing.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are no nits, warnings or errors identified by idnits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes. The document only has Informative references.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>There are no IANA actions required.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>There are no IANA actions required.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is intended to become an Informational RFC. It documents the experiences and the practices followed of running the IETF hackathon at IETF 108 onwards after recovering from a cancelled hackathon at IETF 107 due to the late move to a virtual meeting. Hence Informational seems to be the right classification for this. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>IETF Hackathons encourage the IETF community to collaborate on running code related to existing and evolving Internet standards. This document provides a set of practices that have been used for running IETF Hackathons. These practices apply to Hackathons in which both in-person and remote participation are possible with adaptations for Hackathons that are online only.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document was presented to shmoo early in the WG lifecycle where there was discussion on whether an RFC was the right mechanism to capture these experiences and practices and there was widespread agreement in the WG that it was. There was a lot of feedback on the draft both prior to its adoption as WG item as well as after. All issues brought up on the draft were tracked using an issue tracker on github and the shepherd has confirmed that these have been addressed in the latest version of the draft.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The document has been presented several times to the working group and all the feedback received has been addressed in the latest revision. The document has received significant review from the WG before and after adoption and also during working group last call.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Mallory Knodel is the Document Shepherd. Lars Eggert is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>Charles has clearly documented the tried and true formula for the IETF Hackathon and it's a privilege to have this excellent work documented in the shmoo working group. It is within scope of the shmoo charter for the critical elements of remote participation in all meetings, including appropriate considerations for those that are online only. My review was for consistency of documentation only and to ensure there were no questions, gaps or confusing information. Charles has addressed all issues both on the list and in Github, and incorporated all PRs. With these minor changes, the document is certainly ready to progress towards publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No. Both of the WG chairs have reviewed multiple versions of the draft and are comfortable with the level of review this draft has received till date.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There is solid WG consensus behind this document. A large number of WG participants have expressed support for this draft and there has been no opposition to it progressing.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are no nits, warnings or errors identified by idnits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes. The document only has Informative references.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.
