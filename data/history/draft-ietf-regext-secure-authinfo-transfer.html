The mechanisms in this document provide a<br>way to avoid long-term password storage entirely, and to only require<br>the storage of hashed (not retrievable) passwords instead of encrypted<br>passwords.&nbsp; (Or, in a more colloquial language, "passwords suck, and we<br>want to get out of the business of handling them to the extent<br>possible".)&nbsp; The third paragraph does talk about the "overall goal", but<br>doesn't say much about what we're moving *away* from (and why).<br><br>I think giving some explicit consideration of the lifecycle and protocol<br>interactions for the password 'salt' would be helpful.&nbsp;

 "Strong Random Authorization Information":&nbsp; The EPP RFCs define the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  password-based authorization information value using an XML<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  schema "normalizedString" type, so they don't restrict what can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be used in any way.&nbsp; This operational practice defines the<br><br>I suggest s/in any way/in any substantial way/ (not being able to use<br>CR/LF/TAB is in some sense a restriction).<br><br>&nbsp;

 The strength of the random authorization information is dependent on<br>&nbsp;  the actual entropy of the underlying random number generator.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  the random number generator, the practices defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>] and<br>&nbsp;  section 4.7.1 of the NIST Federal Information Processing Standards<br>&nbsp;  (FIPS) Publication 140-2 [FIPS-140-2] SHOULD be followed to produce<br>&nbsp;  random values that will be resistant to attack.&nbsp; A random number<br>&nbsp;  generator (RNG) is preferable over the use of a pseudorandom number<br>&nbsp;  generator (PRNG) to reduce the predictability of the authorization<br>&nbsp;  information.&nbsp; The more predictable the random number generator is,<br>&nbsp;  the lower the true entropy, and the longer the required length for<br>&nbsp;  the authorization information.<br><br>This is not really the advice that I would be giving, myself.<br>For one, using a true RNG is not necessarily better than a PRNG, since a<br>good PRNG will have a lot of well-thought-out "whitening" functionality<br>that makes the output fairly uniform.&nbsp; A true RNG can be a true RNG<br>while still sampling from a non-uniform distribution and leaving<br>patterns in the output.&nbsp; But more importantly, implementors of EPP are<br>highly unlikely to need to care about the entropy gathering practices<br>specified by NIST SP 140-2 and <a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC 4086</a> -- they can and should just use<br>/dev/urandom!&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC 4086</a> was written in a time when /dev/urandom was not<br>as reliable as it is nowadays, but the advice of "to obtain randon<br>numbers under Linux, Solaris, [...] all an application has to do is open<br>either /dev/random or /dev/urandom and read the desired number of<br>bytes" is arguably the most important guidance in it.&nbsp; (There's also a<br>corresponding Windows API.)&nbsp; If we don't think people will want to<br>implement a 94-character alphabet themselves, we can suggest the widely<br>available base64 encoding and say something like "read 18 bytes from<br>/dev/random and base64 encode it, which will produce 24 characters of<br>encoded output" or give the ROUNDUP(128/log2 64) math.&nbsp; (I use 18 bytes<br>because that avoids base64 padding characters.)<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>I strongly suggest giving some guidance to registrars on how to set the<br>TTL (presumably a week or a few days is doable for common/generic domain<br>transfers?).&nbsp; The requirements in §4.3 are not really aligned with<br>current best practices for password hashing for long term storage<br>(which, admittedly, are designed for human-selected passwords and not<br>random ones), so clamping down the TTL is going to be helpful for<br>putting bounds on some classes of attack.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-kitten-password-storage/">draft-ietf-kitten-password-storage</a> is underway to write<br>down best practices for password hashing and storage.&nbsp; It is probably<br>not mature enough to be used as a definitive reference yet, but could be<br>useful information.<br><br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; The authorization information MUST be stored by the registry<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  using a strong one-way cryptographic hash, with at least a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  256-bit hash function such as SHA-256 [FIPS-180-4], and with a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  random salt.<br><br>Typical password-hashing recommendations these days are things like<br>Argon2 (winner of <a href="https://www.password-hashing.net/">https://www.password-hashing.net/</a>) or PBKDF2 (for<br>somewhat more legacy systems).&nbsp; The iteration count (and other<br>parameters, for Argon2) can be tweaked depending on the systems in<br>question and the esteimated strength of the password, but nobody is<br>doing just a single-iteration of (salted) SHA256.&nbsp; I note that we<br>recently approved <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-crmf-update-algs/">draft-ietf-lamps-crmf-update-algs</a> that leaves in place<br>a requirement that the iteration count MUST be at least 100 (and adds<br>"SHOULD be as large as server performance will allow, typically at least<br>10,000").&nbsp; If the intent is to take advantage of the special<br>considerations here about the nature of the passwords in question, in<br>order to diverge from password-hashing best practice, we should be<br>explicit about the intentional divergence.<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; The plain text version of the authorization information MUST NOT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  be written to any logs by the registrar or the registry, nor<br><br>nit: "the registrar" is perhaps ambiguous in this scenario where we have<br>both losing and gaining registrars.<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Any input authorization information value MUST NOT match an unset<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  authorization information value.<br><br>Does this only apply to non-empty input authorization information?<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; A non-empty input authorization information value MUST be hashed<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and matched against the set authorization information value,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  which is stored using the same hash algorithm.<br><br>It might be worth a few sentences (not necessarily here) about<br>password-hashing-algorithm agility and what an algorithm transition<br>would look like.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Because of this, registries may validate the randomness of the<br>&nbsp;  authorization information based on the length and character set<br>&nbsp;  required by the registry.&nbsp; For example, validating an authorization<br>&nbsp;  value contains a combination of upper-case, lower-case, and non-<br>&nbsp;  alphanumeric characters, in an attempt to assess the strength of the<br>&nbsp;  value, and return an EPP error result of 2202 if the check fails.<br><br>&nbsp;  Such checks are, by their nature, heuristic and imperfect, and may<br>&nbsp;  identify well-chosen authorization information values as being not<br>&nbsp;  sufficiently strong.&nbsp; Registrars, therefore, must be prepared for an<br>&nbsp;  error response of 2202, "Invalid authorization information", and<br>&nbsp;  respond by generating a new value and trying again, possibly more<br>&nbsp;  than once.<br><br>I note for the record that we had an earlier conversation about this<br>behavior, and I still believe that it does not reflect a best practice<br>for minimizing the use of weak passwords.&nbsp; That said, it is a<br>non-normative example, and we basically already had our discussion on<br>this topic, so there is no need to rehash it again -- this is a<br>non-blocking comment.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;

 Section 4.1 defines the use a secure random value for the generation<br>&nbsp;  of the authorization information.&nbsp; The server SHOULD define policy<br>&nbsp;  related to the length and set of characters that are included in the<br>&nbsp;  randomization to target the desired entropy level, with the<br>&nbsp;  recommendation of at least 128 bits for entropy.&nbsp; The authorization<br>&nbsp;  information server policy is communicated to the client using an out-<br>&nbsp;  of-band process.&nbsp; The client SHOULD choose a length and set of<br>&nbsp;  characters that results in entropy that meets or exceeds the server<br>&nbsp;  policy.&nbsp; A random number generator (RNG) is preferable over the use<br>&nbsp;  of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) when creating the<br>&nbsp;  authorization information value.<br><br>[my comment from above about RNG vs PRNG applies here as well.]<br><br>I am a little uneasy about the "SHOULD define policy", which may just<br>reflect a misundersanding of the text.&nbsp; If this is just an<br>administrative policy that is written and read by humans, that is<br>probably useful, but how it interacts with mechanical enforcement (per<br>my previous comments) could spill over into a regime of giving normative<br>recommendations to do things that I do not believe are best practice.<br><br>&nbsp;

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard is the requested type of RFC.&nbsp; Discussions among the working group led us to agree that this RFC fit best in the "A Technical Specification is any description of a protocol, service, procedure, convention or format" described in Section 3.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a>.&nbsp; It is included in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document defines an operational practice, using the EPP RFCs, that leverages the use of strong random authorization information values that are short-lived, that are not stored by the client, and that are stored using a cryptographic hash by the server to provide for secure authorization information used for transfers.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>The document has been discussed within the regext working group with the authors addressing all comments by incorporating agreed upon changes into the document.&nbsp; There was nothing worthy of noting during the WG Process.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>CentralNic has a working implementation in their production environment as well as two other gTLD registry systems, and two ccTLD registry systems.&nbsp; Verisign has implemented a full client and server stub implementation.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shephard is Jody Kolker, <a href="mailto:jkolker@godaddy.com">jkolker@godaddy.com</a><br>Area Director is Barry Leiba, <a href="mailto:barryleiba@computer.org">barryleiba@computer.org</a>.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>As document shepherd I have verified all XML examples against <a href="/doc/rfc5730/">RFC 5730</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5731/">RFC 5731</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5733/">RFC 5733</a>.<br><br>All normative references have been verified.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been submitted for this document.<br><br>I've reviewed the mailing lists for the regext working group and have found no remaining objections to this document.&nbsp; I believe this document is ready for publication.<br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>I have no specific concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Both authors have confirmed that all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>It has been my observation that the WG as a whole understands and agrees with the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist).
