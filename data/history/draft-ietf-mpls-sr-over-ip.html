These two IGP documents allow for the UDP destination ports to be specified in the tunnel encapsulation attribute, while <a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC7510</a> requires the use of 6635 as the destination port. I think it would be good if this draft specifies what happens if a different UDP port is received in the IGP tunnel encapsulation attribute. i.e. use the received value, ignore and use 6635, or fail with error.</div></td>

It is wrong.&nbsp; I think that what makes it wrong is the clarification that "the next SR-MPLS capable node along the path" is "the egress of the active node segment".&nbsp; Taken the text is parenthesis out would make me happy.<br><br>2. It is a general statement.&nbsp; The placement is somewhat unfortunate because it seems that it may apply only to the Figure 1 case...but it applies in general...and there is no similar statement then describing Figure 2.&nbsp; Instead of adding something similar for Figure 2, perhaps move the sentence to a place that covers all the use cases.<br><br><br>A third issue with the statement comes up when considering §3.1/§3.2: there is no specification there that explains how to figure out which should be the tunnel destination address.&nbsp; The example in §3.1 only talks about receiving information from E, including the "the encapsulation endpoint and the tunnel type of any tunnel used to reach E"...but says nothing about other potential SR-MPLS capable nodes between A and E, or how A would use a tunnel to one of those transit nodes on the way to E..w.which is what is illustrated in §3.2.1/3.2.2.<br><br><br>(3) A very, very late IPR declaration came in after the IETF LC started.&nbsp; I didn't find a thread where the WG was made aware of it.<br><br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3439/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/3439/</a></div></td>

 Consider router A that receives a labeled packet with top label L(E)<br>&nbsp;  that corresponds to the prefix-SID SID(E) of prefix P(E) advertised<br>&nbsp;  by router E.&nbsp; Suppose the i-th next-hop router (termed NHi) along the<br>&nbsp;

 o&nbsp; The Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) is defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>].<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Router E is SR-MPLS capable, so it advertises an SRGB as described<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions/">I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions</a>] and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions/">I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions</a>].<br><br>I see the first sentence was added in discussion with another reviewer;<br>I wonder if the text would flow better if the order of the sentences was<br>swapped (particularly since this is the very first "processing step",<br>and that declarative sentence does not describe any processing<br>actions).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; When Router E advertises the prefix-SID SID(E) of prefix P(E) it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST also advertise the encapsulation endpoint and the tunnel type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of any tunnel used to reach E.&nbsp; It does this using the mechanisms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; described in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap/">I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap</a>] or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap/">I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap</a>].<br><br>This "it does this" still is implying that IS-IS and OSPF are the only<br>ways this can be done, which (AIUI) is not the intention.&nbsp; (Similarly<br>for the next bullet point's sub-bullets.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; If router E is running ISIS and advertises the ISIS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  capabilities TLV (TLV 242) [<a href="/doc/rfc7981/">RFC7981</a>], it MUST set the "router-<br><br>nit: 7981 seems to call this the "ISIS Router CAPABILITY TLV";

It would need<br>to be a statement of requirements for behavior/functionality in order to<br>keep them from being normative references.<br><br>&nbsp;  Once constructed, the FIB can be used to tell a router how to process<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; It encapsulates the packets according to the encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  advertised in [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap/">I-D.ietf-isis-encapsulation-cap</a>] or<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap/">I-D.ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap</a>].&nbsp; Then it sends the packets towards<br>&nbsp;  the next hop NHi.<br><br>Oh, finally, "NHi" appears again.&nbsp; But are we actually forwarding<br>towards the SR-MPLS-incapable router specifically, or just generically<br>to the immediate next hop (which may or may not be NHi)?<br><br>Also, I'll note that we introduced this list with "the following<br>processing steps apply [for A wanting to send a packet towards E]", but<br>most of the procedures therein involve things that E has to do to<br>advertise the information that A will need in order to make the<br>encapsulation, which feels like somewhat mismatched language.&nbsp; In short,<br>this list of points doesn't tell me much about what specifically *A*<br>does with this packet -- the last point handles what to do with the top<br>label, but I guess we defer to the encapsulation scheme for the gory<br>details (which is probably fine, but maybe the language could be tidied<br>up to mention something about "using the appropriate mechanism for the<br>selected tunnel type (e.g., IP)").<br><br>&nbsp;

 [<a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC7510</a>] specifies an IP-based encapsulation for MPLS, i.e., MPLS-<br>&nbsp;  in-UDP.&nbsp; This approach is applicable where IP-based encapsulation for<br>&nbsp;  MPLS is required and further fine-grained load balancing of MPLS<br>&nbsp;  packets over IP networks over Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or Link<br>&nbsp;  Aggregation Groups (LAGs) is also required.&nbsp; This section provides<br>&nbsp;  details about the forwarding procedure when when UDP encapsulation is<br>&nbsp;  adopted for SR-MPLS over IP.<br><br>(side note) Presumably this is just my lack of background showing, but<br>this text seems to assume that the UDP encapsulation is the only way to<br>do SR-MPLS over IP, with no discussion of <a href="/doc/rfc4023/">RFC 4023</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nodes that are SR-MPLS capable can process SR-MPLS packets.&nbsp; Not all<br>&nbsp;  of the nodes in an SR-MPLS domain are SR-MPLS capable.&nbsp; Some nodes<br>&nbsp;  may be "legacy routers" that cannot handle SR-MPLS packets but can<br>&nbsp;  forward IP packets.&nbsp; An SR-MPLS-capable node MAY advertise its<br>&nbsp;  capabilities using the IGP as described in Section 3.&nbsp; There are six<br>&nbsp;  types of node in an SR-MPLS domain:<br><br>(side note) Similarly, we only talk about SR-MPLS and IP routers here;<br>is there some intermediate "MPLS but not SR-MPLS" category or similar?<br><br>Also, the top-level Section 3 is just introductory text and doesn't<br>really describe much of anything, and if we are considering this to<br>refer to Section 3 and subsections, it then becomes self-referential.<br><br>Section 3.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 OSPF.<br><br>[still declarative]<br><br>&nbsp;  To handle this, when a router (here it is router G) pops the final<br>&nbsp;  SR-MPLS label, it inserts an explicit null label [<a href="/doc/rfc3032/">RFC3032</a>] before<br>&nbsp;  encapsulating the packet in an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward router H<br>&nbsp;  and sending it out.&nbsp; That is, router G pops the top label, discovers<br>&nbsp;  it has reached the bottom of stack, pushes an explicit null label,<br>&nbsp;  and then encapsulates the MPLS packet in a UDP tunnel to router H.<br><br>This seems like a critical functional behavior that is not specific to<br>the usage of IS-IS or OSPF.<br><br>Section 3.2.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, in the example as described in Figure 4, assume F is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; now an SR-MPLS-capable transit node while all the other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assumptions keep unchanged, since F is not identified by a SID in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the stack and an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel is preferred to an MPLS LSP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; according to local policies, router E would replace the current<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; top label with an MPLS-over-UDP tunnel toward router G and send it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out.<br><br>(nit: There's a comma splice before "since F".)<br>This description is a little sparse, and seems to assume the reader<br>knows that, all else being equal, with E, F, and G all being<br>MPLS-capable, the segment from E to G would transit native MPLS, absent<br>the indicated local policy.&nbsp; Since this is explicitly the thing we are<br>contrasting against, it's probably good style to mention the behavior<br>explicitly, too.<br><br>&nbsp;  IP Header Fields:&nbsp; When encapsulating an MPLS packet in UDP, the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resulting packet is further encapsulated in IP for transmission.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv4 or IPv6 may be used according to the capabilities of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network.&nbsp;

While SR-MPLS works seamlessly over <br>&nbsp; MPLS and SRv6 capable networks, it does not work over IPv4 networks<br>&nbsp; without this mechanism. The MPLS label stack is used as a <br>&nbsp; set of source routing instructions, being backward compatible with<br>&nbsp; SR-MPLS.<br><br>- This document describes how SR-MPLS capable LSRs, non-SR MPLS <br>&nbsp; capable LSRs and IP-only routers can seamlessly co-exist and <br>&nbsp; interoperate through the use of SR-MPLS label stacks and IP <br>&nbsp; encapsulation, such as MPLS-in-UDP as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC 7510</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>- The working group process has been very smooth and straight<br>&nbsp; forward. We have very good support for the document.<br><br>- Early there were two competing individual documents, and the<br>&nbsp; discussion was quite heated. The WG chairs for both the SPRING and<br>&nbsp; MPLS working groups early suggested to merge the documents. That<br>&nbsp; this merge actually could take place is very much thanks to the strong<br>&nbsp; leadership of Zhenbin (Robin) Li who worked&nbsp; with the the two author<br>&nbsp; teams to make this happen.<br><br>- Most of the discussion on which working group should progress the<br>&nbsp; draft took place before making the draft a working group document.<br>&nbsp; That discussion was whether the document should be progressed <br>&nbsp; in SPRING or MPLS, since this builds on <a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC 7510</a> (an MPLS RFC) and<br>&nbsp; describes how the MPLS label stack is used as a set of source <br>&nbsp; routing instructions, the discussion converged on progressing the<br>&nbsp; document in the MPLS WG.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>- we do not currently know for certain if there are implementations<br>&nbsp; of this specification. An implementation poll has been sent to the<br>&nbsp; MPLS working group, the shepherd write-up will be updated as soon <br>&nbsp; as we get further information.<br><br>- there were no special reviews outside the normal working group<br>&nbsp; process (MPLS-RT review, adoption poll, mailing list discussion <br>&nbsp; and WGLC).<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>- Loa Anderson is the Document Shepherd<br>- Deborah Brungard is the Responsible Area Director<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>- The document shepherd has reviewed the document basically at the<br>&nbsp; steps in the working group process, when the documents that were <br>&nbsp; merged were posted, when the documents were merged, before the WGAP<br>&nbsp; and WGLC.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>- No such concerns<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>- No such reviews needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>- No such concerns<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>- All the co-authors have stated on the MPLS mailing list that they <br>&nbsp; are unaware of any non-disclosed IPRs relating to this document.<br><br>- All the contributors has stated on the MPLS mailing list that they<br>&nbsp; are unaware of any non-disclosed IPRs relating to this document.<br><br>- There are 6 co-authors and 13 contributors, the process to get <br>&nbsp; responses to the IPR poll were lengthy. When we sent the document<br>&nbsp; to WGLC one of the contributors had not responded to the IPR poll.<br>&nbsp; The working group was notified about this, but it generated no <br>&nbsp; discussion, and during the WGLC we got the final response in.<br><br>- the high number of authors/contributors is becasue this is a merge<br>&nbsp; of two documents, and both document contributed both authors and <br>&nbsp; contributors, the number of authors has been decrease to an <br>&nbsp; acceptable number (6), by moving former "authors" to <br>&nbsp; "contributors". This has been done even though we know that among<br>&nbsp; the listed contributors there are people that have independently <br>&nbsp; contributed text. The process of reducing the number of authors <br>&nbsp; has required quite a bit discussion, and the WG chairs and the <br>&nbsp; WG very appreciate the spirit of cooperation that made this <br>&nbsp; process possible.<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>- There are two IPR disclosures against documents that were <br>&nbsp; predecessors to the working group document, they are both pointing<br>&nbsp; to the same US patent.<br><br>&nbsp; The working group has been notified of the IPR disclosures, but no<br>&nbsp; discussion toom place. The customary interpretation of this is is <br>&nbsp; that the conditions listed in the IPR disclosures are acceptable to<br>&nbsp; the working group.<br>&nbsp; <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>- The support for this document is very strong.&nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>- No such threats<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>- The document passes ID nits clean<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>- No such formal reviews necessary<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>- All references are correctly split into Normative and Informative<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>- All the normative references (with one exception) are to published <br>&nbsp; standard track RFCs.<br><br>- The exception is ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls, which has been <br>&nbsp; submitted to the IESG for publication.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>- no downward references<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>- the publication of this document will not change the status of any<br>&nbsp; existing RFC<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>- There are no request for IANA actions in this document<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>- No new regisgtries are specified in the document<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a forchecks or mal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>- No such automated checks or reviews are necessary.<br><br></div></td>

While SR-MPLS works seamlessly over <br>&nbsp; MPLS and SRv6 capable networks, it does not work over IPv4 networks<br>&nbsp; without this mechanism. The MPLS label stack is used as a <br>&nbsp; set of source routing instructions, being backward compatible with<br>&nbsp; SR-MPLS.<br><br>- This document describes how SR-MPLS capable LSRs, non-SR MPLS <br>&nbsp; capable LSRs and IP-only routers can seamlessly co-exist and <br>&nbsp; interoperate through the use of SR-MPLS label stacks and IP <br>&nbsp; encapsulation, such as MPLS-in-UDP as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC 7510</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting?

The WG chairs for both the SPRING and<br>&nbsp; MPLS working groups early suggested to merge the documents.That<br>&nbsp; this merge actually could take place is very much thanks to the strong<br> leadership of Zhenbin (Robin) Li who worked&nbsp; with the the two author<br> teams to make this happen.<br><br>- Most of the discussion on which working group should progress the<br>&nbsp; draft took place before making the draft a working group document.<br>&nbsp; That discussion was whether the document should be progressed <br>&nbsp; in SPRING or MPLS, since this builds on <a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC 7510</a> (an MPLS RFC) and<br>&nbsp; describes how the MPLS label stack is used as a set of source <br>&nbsp; routing instructions, the discussion converged on progressing the<br>&nbsp; document in the MPLS WG.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol?
