I'll re-do my review using it, but need more time, so I am hitting DEFER.)<br><br>This document seems promising and needed, but as noted below, I think it still needs work before it should advance. I support Lars's DISCUSS -- as noted below, lack of the foundational Normative reference prevented me from being able to complete a meaningful review of this document. I notice this point was raised in a DISCUSS by Eric Rescorla in 2019, I'm surprised it hasn't been addressed. I do see in the shepherd write-up that "Access to the NFC spec has been available for those that have needed it" but regrettably, it's not clear how this is accomplished. <br><br>## COMMENTS<br><br>### General<br><br>I agree with Warren's observation that "it doesn't seem like [the document] contains enough information to allow a full implementation". Addressing the specific comments below would be helpful, but not sufficient to address that concern, but lacking the [LLCP-1.4] spec it's difficult to be more specific. Because I feel unable to properly evaluate the document's fitness, I'm balloting ABSTAIN.<br><br>The shepherd write-up tells us that "An implementation of 6lo-NFC exists and they participated on a 6lo plugtests". I can only guess that the implementors benefit from being experts who know what to read between the lines, whereas reviewers such as myself can read only what's written in the document. <br><br>### Section 3.2, remove "such as"<br><br>"The LLC contains three components, such as Link Management, Connection-oriented Transmission, and Connectionless Transmission."<br><br>The "such as" seems wrong here. I guess you mean "namely", or you could just remove "such as" and not replace it with anything.<br><br>### Section 3.4, "transported to an I PDU"<br><br>"As mentioned in Section 3.2, when an IPv6 packet is transmitted, the packet MUST be passed down to LLCP of NFC and transported to an I PDU of LLCP of the NFC-enabled peer device."<br><br>Do you mean "... and transported in an I PDU of LLCP *to* the NFC-enabled peer device"?<br><br>### Section 3.4, mystery bits 1011<br><br>Figure 2 shows a field, labeled "1011", occupying bits 16 through 21. It's not clear what this means. It's not discussed in the text. One might imagine it's just a field value mandated by [LLCP-1.4], but in that case one would imagine it would depict a 6-bit string, since the field it's occupying is six bits. What is going on there? I would refer to [LLCP-1.4] to try to find out, but as mentioned, it isn't available for review.<br><br>What's more, the labeling appears to conflict with the text that says "the unused bits in the TLV Value field MUST be set to zero".<br><br>### Section 3.4, how to fit eleven bits into a ten bit field<br><br>Still in Figure 2, we see the rightmost field labeled 0x0~0x7FF, and the paragraph following agrees that the field "MUST be encoded into the least significant 11 bits". But the ruler at the top shows the field extending from bit 22 to bit 31, a field of only 10 bits.<br><br>My guess is you drew the ruler wrong, and it was supposed to start at bit 21? But that would still leave the previous "1011" question open.<br><br>### Section 3.4, MUST be 0x480<br><br>"The MIUX value MUST be 0x480 to support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280 bytes)" unambiguously mandates that MIUX must be exactly 0x480, no more and no less. I understand the "no less" part, as noted in the quote this is needed to support a 1280 byte MTU. However, IPv6 doesn't forbid offering a larger value than 1280. <br><br>I'm guessing you left out an "at least", as in "MUST be at least 0x480". If you really intend to mandate that packets shall be no larger than 1280, please say why?<br><br>### Section 4.3 et seq, 6LBR, 6LR, 6LM<br><br>Please expand 6LBR, 6LR, 6LM on first use.<br><br>### Section 4.4, bullet 2 is hard to understand<br><br>I gave up trying to understand what this bullet means, I'm afraid I can't even hazard a guess at a rewrite. :-(<br><br>## NITS<br><br>### Section 7<br><br>"(i.e., ad-hoc mode and authenticated mode" <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^ does the missing closing parenthesis go here? <br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

I support Lars's DISCUSS -- as noted below, lack of the foundational Normative reference prevented me from being able to complete a meaningful review of this document. I notice this point was raised in a DISCUSS by Eric Rescorla in 2019, I'm surprised it hasn't been addressed. I do see in the shepherd write-up that "Access to the NFC spec has been available for those that have needed it" but regrettably, it's not clear how this is accomplished. <br><br>## COMMENTS<br><br>### General<br><br>I agree with Warren's observation that "it doesn't seem like [the document] contains enough information to allow a full implementation". Addressing the specific comments below would be helpful, but not sufficient to address that concern, but lacking the [LLCP-1.4] spec it's difficult to be more specific. Because I feel unable to properly evaluate the document's fitness, I'm balloting ABSTAIN.<br><br>The shepherd write-up tells us that "An implementation of 6lo-NFC exists and they participated on a 6lo plugtests". I can only guess that the implementors benefit from being experts who know what to read between the lines, whereas reviewers such as myself can read only what's written in the document. <br><br>### Section 3.2, remove "such as"<br><br>"The LLC contains three components, such as Link Management, Connection-oriented Transmission, and Connectionless Transmission."<br><br>The "such as" seems wrong here. I guess you mean "namely", or you could just remove "such as" and not replace it with anything.<br><br>### Section 3.4, "transported to an I PDU"<br><br>"As mentioned in Section 3.2, when an IPv6 packet is transmitted, the packet MUST be passed down to LLCP of NFC and transported to an I PDU of LLCP of the NFC-enabled peer device."<br><br>Do you mean "... and transported in an I PDU of LLCP *to* the NFC-enabled peer device"?<br><br>### Section 3.4, mystery bits 1011<br><br>Figure 2 shows a field, labeled "1011", occupying bits 16 through 21. It's not clear what this means. It's not discussed in the text. One might imagine it's just a field value mandated by [LLCP-1.4], but in that case one would imagine it would depict a 6-bit string, since the field it's occupying is six bits. What is going on there? I would refer to [LLCP-1.4] to try to find out, but as mentioned, it isn't available for review.<br><br>What's more, the labeling appears to conflict with the text that says "the unused bits in the TLV Value field MUST be set to zero".<br><br>### Section 3.4, how to fit eleven bits into a ten bit field<br><br>Still in Figure 2, we see the rightmost field labeled 0x0~0x7FF, and the paragraph following agrees that the field "MUST be encoded into the least significant 11 bits". But the ruler at the top shows the field extending from bit 22 to bit 31, a field of only 10 bits.<br><br>My guess is you drew the ruler wrong, and it was supposed to start at bit 21? But that would still leave the previous "1011" question open.<br><br>### Section 3.4, MUST be 0x480<br><br>"The MIUX value MUST be 0x480 to support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280 bytes)" unambiguously mandates that MIUX must be exactly 0x480, no more and no less. I understand the "no less" part, as noted in the quote this is needed to support a 1280 byte MTU. However, IPv6 doesn't forbid offering a larger value than 1280. <br><br>I'm guessing you left out an "at least", as in "MUST be at least 0x480". If you really intend to mandate that packets shall be no larger than 1280, please say why?<br><br>### Section 4.3 et seq, 6LBR, 6LR, 6LM<br><br>Please expand 6LBR, 6LR, 6LM on first use.<br><br>### Section 4.4, bullet 2 is hard to understand<br><br>I gave up trying to understand what this bullet means, I'm afraid I can't even hazard a guess at a rewrite. :-(<br><br>## NITS<br><br>### Section 7<br><br>"(i.e., ad-hoc mode and authenticated mode" <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^ does the missing closing parenthesis go here? <br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a></div></td>

There is no <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP14</a> words in it.<br><br>If normative, then how is Network_ID derived from any NFC parameter?<br><br>### Section 4.3<br><br>While not really a DISCUSS point, what is the link between DHCP-PD and a LLA ? Remove the part about getting a prefix.<br><br>What is a `secured and stable IID` ?

There is no <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP14</a> terms.<br><br>Is there a IANA registry for "Dispatch" values ? If so, then please add a reference. It *seems* that the length is 1 octet, please specify the length of the value.<br><br>### Section 4.6<br><br>Possibly due to my ignorance of <a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC 6282</a>, but this document refers to TCP (section 4.1) while <a href="/doc/rfc6282/">RFC 6282</a> only compresses UDP ? <br><br>Is `6-bit NFC link-layer` the same as the `6-bit SSAP` discussed before ? I guess so but I should not guess but be sure.<br><br>### Section 4.8<br><br>Is this section normative about multicast replication ?<br><br>### Section 5.1<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  Two or more 6LNs may be connected with a 6LBR, but each connection<br>&nbsp;  uses a different subnet.<br>```<br>Unsure whether 'subnet' means 'IPv6 prefix' or 'link' ?<br><br>`the 6LBR MUST ensure address collisions do not occur` how can this goal be achieved.</div></td>

Please provide such a <br>Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones<br>&nbsp;  and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other<br>&nbsp;  by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no<br>&nbsp;  more than 10 cm. The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available<br>&nbsp;  in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN<br>&nbsp;  techniques.<br><br>&nbsp;  Considering the potential for exponential growth in the number of<br>&nbsp;  heterogeneous air interface technologies, NFC would be widely used as<br>&nbsp;  one of the other air interface technologies, such as Bluetooth Low<br>&nbsp;  Energy (BT-LE), Wi-Fi, and so on.&nbsp; Each of the heterogeneous air<br>&nbsp;  interface technologies has its own characteristics, which cannot be<br>&nbsp;  covered by the other technologies, so various kinds of air interface<br>&nbsp;  technologies would co-exist together.&nbsp; Therefore, it is required for<br>&nbsp;  them to communicate with each other. Running IPv6 over the various low<br>&nbsp;  power L2 technologies with the modified 6lowpan stack ensures interoperability<br>&nbsp;  among the devices with various heterogeneous air interfaces. <br> <br><br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular<br> points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>A. This document has been revised several times based on working group comments. It has been reviewed by <br>&nbsp;  several experienced 6lo working group members including Pascal Thubert and Dave Thaler&nbsp; who have been<br>&nbsp;  designated reviewers of this document. It has has also received shepherd's comments and went through two<br>&nbsp;  WGLC ( one short and one regular one).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their <br>plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no <br>substantive issues?

If this version<br> of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>A. This document has had two document shepherds. Samita Chakrabarti reviewed the -09 version of the document and provided comments. She considered that the -10 version of 6lo-nfc document was ready for publication. The IESG evaluated version -13 of the document. At that moment, a new, and the current shepherd (Carles Gomez) was assigned to the document. After the IESG evaluation, the draft was updated several times, in order to address the IESG comments. The current shepherd participated actively in a major (mostly editorial) rewrite of the document, leading to version -17 of the document. The current shepherd considered that -17 was ready for publication. (Note that, as of the last update of this writeup, a subsequent draft revision, i.e. -18 has been produced in order to address a comment by the AD, Erik Kline, regarding security.)<br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been <br>performed?<br><br>A. The document is ready for IESG review.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security,<br> operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took <br>place.<br><br>A. Not applicable.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the<br> Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br> with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br> if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail <br>those concerns here.<br><br>A.&nbsp; It has been reviewed by a number of WG members and by the former and the current shepherd.

Please provide such a <br>Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones<br>&nbsp;  and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other<br>&nbsp;  by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no<br>&nbsp;  more than 10 cm. The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available<br>&nbsp;  in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN<br>&nbsp;  techniques.<br><br>&nbsp;  Considering the potential for exponential growth in the number of<br>&nbsp;  heterogeneous air interface technologies, NFC would be widely used as<br>&nbsp;  one of the other air interface technologies, such as Bluetooth Low<br>&nbsp;  Energy (BT-LE), Wi-Fi, and so on.&nbsp; Each of the heterogeneous air<br>&nbsp;  interface technologies has its own characteristics, which cannot be<br>&nbsp;  covered by the other technologies, so various kinds of air interface<br>&nbsp;  technologies would co-exist together.&nbsp; Therefore, it is required for<br>&nbsp;  them to communicate with each other. Running IPv6 over the various low<br>&nbsp;  power L2 technologies with the modified 6lowpan stack ensures interoperability<br>&nbsp;  among the devices with various heterogeneous air interfaces. <br> <br><br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular<br> points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>A. This document has been revised several times based on working group comments. It has been reviewed by <br>&nbsp;  several experienced 6lo working group members including Pascal Thubert and Dave Thaler&nbsp; who have been<br>&nbsp;  designated reviewers of this document. It has has also received shepherd's comments and went through two<br>&nbsp;  WGLC ( one short and one regular one).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their <br>plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no <br>substantive issues?

Not clear how MTU is related to MIU? <br>---<br><br>You responded: "YH &gt;&gt; Actually, MIU is the same as MTU. Specifications in NFC forum use 'MIU', and we use 'MTU'. But these two has the same meaning."<br><br>I read version 13 of this document and had the exact same question -- how do I calculate the MTU from the MIU? If they really are the same thing (which I'm not sure they are), the document should state that, so readers can more easily implement.</div></td>

 short-lived links (i.e., single touch-based approaches) for ID<br>&nbsp;  verification and mobile payment.&nbsp; This will mitigate the threat of<br>&nbsp;  correlation of activities over time.<br><br>This mitigation only occurs if the IID is freshly generated for each<br>link, which isn't mentioned until the next paragraph, so it's an<br>unsupported claim at this point in the text.<br><br>&nbsp;  IPv6-over-NFC uses an IPv6 interface identifier formed from a "Short<br>&nbsp;  Address" and a set of well-known constant bits (such as padding with<br>&nbsp;  '0's) for the modified EUI-64 format.&nbsp; However, the short address of<br><br>nit: Is the zero-padding really a "such as" or just a fact, given the<br>protocol specification?<br><br>&nbsp;  NFC link layer (LLC) is not generated as a physically permanent value<br>&nbsp;  but logically generated for each connection.&nbsp; Thus, every single<br>&nbsp;  touch connection can use a different short address of NFC link with<br><br>nit: I don't think this is "can use"; I think this is "uses".<br><br>&nbsp;  an extremely short-lived link.&nbsp; This can mitigate address scanning as<br>&nbsp;  well as location tracking and device-specific vulnerability<br>&nbsp;  exploitation.<br><br>These last two seem to have high overlap with the "correlation of<br>activities over time" from the previous paragraph.<br><br>&nbsp;  Thus, this document does not RECOMMEND sending NFC packets over the<br>&nbsp;  Internet or any unsecured network.<br><br>I don't see any preceding argument that leads into or supports this<br>claim; why is the word "thus" present?<br>Also, such a recommendation seems like it should be more prominently<br>made near the start of the document and not relegated to the security<br>considerations.<br><br>This document also does not give any indication of what might be<br>considered to be a "secure" network.&nbsp; Note that per the <a href="/doc/rfc3552/">RFC 3552</a> threat<br>model, we generally do not place any trust in the network.<br><br>Section 9.2<br><br>Isn't the whole point of this work that you are doing IPv6 over NFC?<br>How do you not need to implement NFC in order to implement this?</div></td>

The intended status is indicated<br>in the document header. Since it is defining ipv6-over NFC adaptation layer, it is standard track.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a <br>Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones<br>&nbsp;  and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other<br>&nbsp;  by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no<br>&nbsp;  more than 10 cm. The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available<br>&nbsp;  in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN<br>&nbsp;  techniques.<br><br>&nbsp;  Considering the potential for exponential growth in the number of<br>&nbsp;  heterogeneous air interface technologies, NFC would be widely used as<br>&nbsp;  one of the other air interface technologies, such as Bluetooth Low<br>&nbsp;  Energy (BT-LE), Wi-Fi, and so on.&nbsp; Each of the heterogeneous air<br>&nbsp;  interface technologies has its own characteristics, which cannot be<br>&nbsp;  covered by the other technologies, so various kinds of air interface<br>&nbsp;  technologies would co-exist together.&nbsp; Therefore, it is required for<br>&nbsp;  them to communicate with each other. Running IPv6 over the various low<br>&nbsp;  power L2 technologies with the modified 6lowpan stack ensures interoperability<br>&nbsp;  among the devices with various heterogeneous air interfaces. <br> <br><br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular<br> points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>A. This document has been revised several times based on working group comments. It has been reviewed by <br>&nbsp;  several experienced 6lo working group members including Pascal Thubert and Dave Thaler&nbsp; who have been<br>&nbsp;  designated reviewers of this document. It has has also received shepherd's comments and went through two<br>&nbsp;  WGLC ( one short and one regular one).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their <br>plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no <br>substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)?<br> In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>A.<br><br>The document has been reviewed and discussed by many 6lo experts in the WG including Pascal Thubert, Carsten Bormann,<br> Dave Thaler, Samita Chakrabarti, Gabriel Montenegro, James Woodyatt, Alex Petrescue, Michael Richardson. <br><br>An implementation of 6lo-NFC exists and they participated on a 6lo plugtests.<br>The document effort is also socialized with NFC-Forum and they are well aware this document.<br> <br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took <br>place.<br><br>A. Not applicable.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the<br> Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br> with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br> if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail <br>those concerns here.<br><br>A.&nbsp; It has been reviewed by a number of WG members and the shepherd.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in <br>the title page header?<br><br>A. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6lo-nfc/10/">draft-ietf-6lo-nfc-10</a> draft is a 'standards track' document. The intended status is indicated<br>in the document header. Since it is defining ipv6-over NFC adaptation layer, it is standard track.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a <br>Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones<br>&nbsp;  and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other<br>&nbsp;  by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no<br>&nbsp;  more than 10 cm. The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available<br>&nbsp;  in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN<br>&nbsp;  techniques.<br><br>&nbsp;  Considering the potential for exponential growth in the number of<br>&nbsp;  heterogeneous air interface technologies, NFC would be widely used as<br>&nbsp;  one of the other air interface technologies, such as Bluetooth Low<br>&nbsp;  Energy (BT-LE), Wi-Fi, and so on.&nbsp; Each of the heterogeneous air<br>&nbsp;  interface technologies has its own characteristics, which cannot be<br>&nbsp;  covered by the other technologies, so various kinds of air interface<br>&nbsp;  technologies would co-exist together.&nbsp; Therefore, it is required for<br>&nbsp;  them to communicate with each other. Running IPv6 over the various low<br>&nbsp;  power L2 technologies with the modified 6lowpan stack ensures interoperability<br>&nbsp;  among the devices with various heterogeneous air interfaces. <br> <br><br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular<br> points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>A. This document has been revised several times based on working group comments. It has been reviewed by <br>&nbsp;  several experienced 6lo working group members including Pascal Thubert and Dave Thaler&nbsp; who have been<br>&nbsp;  designated reviewers of this document. It has has also received shepherd's comments and went through two<br>&nbsp;  WGLC ( one short and one regular one).<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their <br>plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no <br>substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)?<br> In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>A.<br><br>The document has been reviewed and discussed by many 6lo experts in the WG including Pascal Thubert, Carsten Bormann,<br> Dave Thaler, Samita Chakrabarti, Gabriel Montenegro, James Woodyatt, Alex Petrescue, Michael Richardson. <br><br>An implementation of 6lo-NFC exists and they participated on a 6lo plugtests.<br>The document effort is also socialized with NFC-Forum and they are well aware this document.<br> <br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If this version<br> of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>A. Document shepherd has reviewed the -09 version of the document and provided comments. The -10 <br>&nbsp;  version of 6lo-nfc document is ready for publication.<br><br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been <br>performed?<br><br>A. The document is ready for IESG review.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security,<br> operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took <br>place.<br><br>A. Not applicable.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the<br> Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br> with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it.
