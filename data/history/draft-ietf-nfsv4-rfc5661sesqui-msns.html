 o&nbsp; In some cases, a server will have a namespace more extensive than<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its local namespace by using features associated with attributes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that provide file system location information.&nbsp; These features,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which allow construction of a multi-server namespace are all<br><br>nit: comma after "multi-server namespace".<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A file system present in a server's pseudo-fs may have multiple<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file system instances on different servers associated with it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All such instances are considered replicas of one another.<br><br>[Some readers might take this as requiring live read/write replication<br>such that all writes to any instance are immediately visible on all<br>other instances.&nbsp; The rest of the document ought to disabuse them of<br>that notion, and yet...]<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; File system location entries provide the individual file system<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; locations within the file system location attributes.&nbsp; Each such<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entry specifies a server, in the form of a host name or IP an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address, and an fs name, which designates the location of the file<br><br>nit: s/IP an/an IP/.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; client may establish connections.&nbsp; There may be multiple endpoints<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because a host name may map to multiple network addresses and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because multiple connection types may be used to communicate with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a single network address.&nbsp; However, all such endpoints MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provide a way of connecting to a single server.&nbsp; The exact form of<br><br>nit: "MUST provide" feels strange here, since it implies in some sense<br>an extra layer of indirection ("A lists X, and X among other things<br>provides Y"); would a different word like "indicate" work?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; element derives from a corresponding location entry.&nbsp; When a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; location entry specifies an IP address there is only a single<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; corresponding location element.&nbsp; File system location entries that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contain a host name are resolved using DNS, and may result in one<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or more location elements.&nbsp; All location elements consist of a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; location address which is the IP address of an interface to a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; server and an fs name which is the location of the file system<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; within the server's local namespace.&nbsp; The fs name can be empty if<br><br>I can't decide whether both instances of "IP address" are pedantically<br>correct, in the presence of the potential for port information to be<br>included/available.&nbsp;

This attribute only allows specification of the file system<br>&nbsp;  locations where the data corresponding to a given file system may be<br>&nbsp;  found.&nbsp; Servers should make this attribute available whenever<br>&nbsp;  fs_locations_info is supported, but client use of fs_locations_info<br>&nbsp;  is preferable, as it provides more information.<br><br>I think this was probably okay as "SHOULD make this attribute available"<br>(as it was in 5661), but don't object to the lowercase version either.<br><br>Section 11.5<br><br>&nbsp;

 o&nbsp; If the fs_status attribute indicates that the file system is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; migrated one (i.e. fss_absent is true and fss_type !=<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STATUS4_REFERRAL) and thus that it is likely that the fetch of the<br>&nbsp;

 Once the client has determined the initial migration status, and<br>&nbsp;  determined that there was a shift to a new server, it needs to re-<br>&nbsp;  establish its locking state, if possible.&nbsp; To enable this to happen<br>&nbsp;  without loss of the guarantees normally provided by locking, the<br>&nbsp;  destination server needs to implement a per-fs grace period in all<br>&nbsp;  cases in which lock state was lost, including those in which<br>&nbsp;  Transparent State Migration was not implemented.<br><br>Similarly to above, does this imply that the migration has to happen for<br>all clients concurrently, as opposed to clients getting migrated in<br>sequence?<br><br>Section 11.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; reissued request should avoid the non-idempotent operation.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request still must use a SEQUENCE operation with either a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; different slot id or sequence value from the SEQUENCE in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; original request.&nbsp; Because this is done, there is no way the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replier could avoid spuriously re-executing the non-idempotent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operation since the different SEQUENCE parameters prevent the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requester from recognizing that the non-idempotent operation is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; being retried.<br><br>I don't think that this is very clear about the counterfactual scenario<br>in which the replier is trying to avoid spuriously re-executing the<br>non-idempotent operation.&nbsp;

This document is focused update to <br>&nbsp;  addresses the above specific issues. It is not a full update that<br>&nbsp;  addresses all known issues with NFS 4.1. <br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The working group was well aligned on the work that is the core of <br>&nbsp;  the update and it moved through the review process with good input '<br>&nbsp;  but nothing contentious. The format of the original update <br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nfsv4-mv1-msns-update/04/">draft-ietf-nfsv4-mv1-msns-update-04</a>) was rejected by IESG. The <br>&nbsp;  issues raised by the IESG resulted in this updated full document<br>&nbsp;  that doesn't address all known issues to avoid the additional <br>&nbsp;  delay resolving those issues would result in. <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp;  This document was a result of implementation and deployment<br>&nbsp;  experience and represents input from the NFSv4 community with long<br>&nbsp;  standing experience.&nbsp; The authors represent the quality work of the<br>&nbsp;  working group and are trusted in the community with their<br>&nbsp;  experience and ability to draft quality, useful text.<br><br>&nbsp; As the update is focused on a specific scope and the document is long,<br>&nbsp; reviewers likely need to focus on the updated parts, for example as <br>&nbsp;  shown by rfcdiff:<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5661.txt&amp;url2=https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc5661sesqui-msns-03.txt">https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5661.txt&amp;url2=https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc5661sesqui-msns-03.txt</a><br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  Magnus Westerlund &amp; Spencer Shepler is the document shepherd.<br>&nbsp;  Magnus Westerlund is the responsible area director.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>Spencer Shepler have read and reviewed the document as part of the<br>working group last call and have been supportive of the work from<br>first suggestion.
