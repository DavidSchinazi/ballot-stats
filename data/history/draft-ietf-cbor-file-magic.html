(I don't know what that would mean, it's just a<br>straightforward way to parse it. "May" combined with "only" is<br>the difficult bit I think.) If your meaning is what I think it is,<br>substituting "might" for "may" would fix it.<br><br>But in the final analysis, the fact that all I've got is quibbles is<br>evidence of a job well done, thank you. :-)</div></td>

(And "file" isn't an "on-disk recognition<br>system" either, it's a heuristic file type classifier.)<br><br>Section 2.1, paragraph 1, comment:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA policy for 4-byte CBOR Tags is First Come First Served, so<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; all that is required is an email to IANA, having filled in the small<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; template provided in Section 9.2 of [<a href="/doc/std94/">STD94</a>].<br><br>FCFS codepoints may be requested in different ways in the future (e.g., web<br>forms) in addition to email. The document need not go into details on how FCFS<br>requests are made.<br><br>Section 2.1, paragraph 0, comment:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; In order to be in the four-byte range, and so that there are no<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; leading zeros, the value needs to be in the range 0x01000000 (decimal<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; 16777216) to 0xFFFFFFFF (decimal 4294967295).<br><br>Including or excluding those two boundary values?<br><br>Section 2.1, paragraph -1, comment:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; The use of a sequence of four US-ASCII codes which are mnemonic to<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; the protocol is encouraged, but not required.<br><br>If it's encouraged, why not require it, so that software can actually depend on<br>it rather than needing to test for it? (Ditto for the suggestion to avoid<br>zeroes.)<br><br>Thanks to Pete Resnick for their General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) review<br>(<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gen-art/UX8_f-rnj6FGgrSKRd-WCB8SuYg">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/gen-art/UX8_f-rnj6FGgrSKRd-WCB8SuYg</a>).<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>All comments below are about very minor potential issues that you may choose to<br>address in some way - or ignore - as you see fit.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document aims to become a Proposed Standard. It does have characteristics that would also indicate Informational (it is registering code points in FCFS regions of IANA registries), but we anticipate that this mechanism will be used and referenced in future normative documents, thus going for PS.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document defines an on-disk format for CBOR objects that is friendly to common on-disk recognition systems such as the Unix file(1) command. It describes methods for the different cases of tagging CBOR objects, CBOR streams and for data transported in CoAP messages.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>TBD (Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?)<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>TBD (Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?)<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>Christian Amsüss is Document Shepherd, Francesca Palombini is Responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>TBD<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No. There have been few on-list reviews, but much collaboration inside the WG during interim meetings as documented in their minutes.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>File formats and file type recognition falls into the broad ART area expertise; review has been solicited, provided by Bernard Aboba (see ), and addressed in the later versions of the document (eg. the switch to Proposed Standard).<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>TBD<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR has been disclosed to date. (TBD check before submit).<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>It's a small working group, but it is supported and understood by a large portion. (Looking at the list interactions and interim minutes, most of that is visible from adoption time; in later stages discussions were mostly about details more relevant on a quality-of-document level than on a consensus-on-what-we-do level and thus involved fewer vocal people).<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>The tools complain about non-ASCII characters and reference mismatches (on <a href="/doc/rfc8949/">RFC8949</a> / <a href="/doc/std94/">STD94</a>); both appear to be in order in the produced documents.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>No formal review criteria apply.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes; in particular, none of the informative references are required to understand when implementing this document.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>TBD<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>All allocations happen in FCFS areas.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The CDDL snippets in the code validated on <a href="https://cddl.anweiss.tech/">https://cddl.anweiss.tech/</a><br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?
