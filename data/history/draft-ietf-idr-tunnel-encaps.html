So my view after having read this one is that the signalling is specified in a two tier fashion, with an outer encapsulation that can be IPvX, IPvX/UDP for example and then a tunnel protocol like GRE, VXLAN, L2TPv3. So I don't believe all combinations of outer encapsulation and tunnel protocol is actually defined. This document does not provide a table with the reference for where the actual data plan specification for combinations are provided. I think it would be good if there actually existed such a table/list. <br><br>The next aspect of this discuss is the difficulty in determining if the provided sub-TLVs are sufficient. I will mention a number of potential ones that I wonder if they are necessary to configure these combinations. <br><br>To build on Erik Kline's discuss. So are for all these combinations when IP is the outer encapsulation is the egress ECN behavior to correctly mark or drop inner payload well defined. If the egress is not guaranteed to do the correct, then I think a configuration option is required. <br><br>When using UDP encapsulation combined with IPv6 there is the question if one can safely use zero-checksum. Per <a href="/doc/rfc6935/">RFC 6935</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC 6936</a> some consideration is needed to determine if the inner payload is safe to combine with zero checksum. So this requires the combination of tunnel protocol and inner payload to determine this. So I think some of these tunnel protocols have text on this, but I don't know which combinations have this specified. And also here arise a question if some of these will also need a configuration option as there exist some inner payloads that could not be safe and thus a different tunnel with checksum enabled may be required. <br><br>When using UDP encapsulation I am wondering over source port usage. To my knowledge some of these protocols like VXLAN do defines that source ports are picked randomly to ensure header hashing will provide different values for different inner flows. So is there a need in any of this cases to identify a single source port? <br><br>So I at least are unable to determine if this specification are containing all necessary attributes when it doesn't have identification of what combinations it expect to work, and what behavior on the above aspects is just working. <br><br>So lets start discussing what needs to be addressed here if any.</div></td>

Section 3.1.1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; describes an optional procedure to make this determination.<br><br>This check seems highly important for the security of the system and<br>should get called out in the security considerations.<br><br>Section 3.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  sub-TLV is considered not to be valid.&nbsp; In some cases a network<br>&nbsp;  operator who controls a set of Autonomous Systems might wish to allow<br>&nbsp;  a Tunnel Egress Endpoint to reside in an AS other than Route_AS;<br>&nbsp;  configuration MAY allow for such a case, in which case the check<br>&nbsp;  becomes, if Egress_AS is not within the configured set of permitted<br>&nbsp;  AS numbers, then the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV is considered to<br>&nbsp;  be "malformed".<br><br>(nit?) maybe "the configured set of permitted AS numbers that contains<br>Route_AS"?&nbsp; The current wording implies that there can only be one such<br>configured set and that it is used regardless of Route_AS, which does<br>not seem right...<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This section defines Encapsulation sub-TLVs for the following tunnel<br>&nbsp;  types: VXLAN ([<a href="/doc/rfc7348/">RFC7348</a>]), NVGRE ([<a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC7637</a>]), MPLS-in-GRE ([<a href="/doc/rfc4023/">RFC4023</a>]),<br>&nbsp;  L2TPv3 ([<a href="/doc/rfc3931/">RFC3931</a>]), and GRE ([<a href="/doc/rfc2784/">RFC2784</a>]).<br><br>Thanks for putting the links all in one place, here.&nbsp; I, at least, would<br>have benefited from also putting the links/references in the<br>corresponding sections, but that is probably just a matter of style.<br><br>Section 3.2.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; R: The remaining bits in the 8-bit flags field are reserved for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; further use.&nbsp; They MUST always be set to 0 by the originator of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the sub-TLV.&nbsp; Intermediate routers MUST propagate them without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modification.&nbsp; Any receiving routers MUST ignore these bits upon a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; receipt of the sub-TLV.<br><br>nit: spurious "a" in "upon a receipt" (and diffing this section against<br>§3.2.2 it seems that maybe the "of the sub-TLV" is also superfluous?).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the V bit is not set, and the BGP UPDATE message has AFI/SAFI<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other than Ethernet VPNs (EVPN) then the VXLAN tunnel cannot be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used.<br><br>If this is intended to refer to SAFI 70 (from <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC 7432</a>), I note that the<br>IANA entry is named "BGP EVPNs".<br><br>[I also don't understand why it's okay for EVPN to not have a VN-ID when<br>using the VXLAN tunnel, but assume that's just my ignorance.]<br><br>Section 3.2.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reserved (two fields): MUST be set to zero on transmission and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disregarded on receipt.<br><br>(nit) I only see one field marked "Reserved" (this format is the same<br>layout as for VXLAN).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The values of the V, M, and R bits are NOT copied into the flags<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; field of the NVGRE header.&nbsp; The flags field of the VXLAN header is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set as per [<a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC7637</a>].<br><br>(nit) stray "VXLAN"?<br><br>Section 3.2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  While it is not really necessary to have both the GRE and MPLS-in-GRE<br>&nbsp;  tunnel types, both are included for reasons of backwards<br>&nbsp;  compatibility.<br><br>It might be nice to have a few more words about which one is the<br>"backward compatible" option and what it's compatible with.<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If an outer Encapsulation sub-TLV occurs in a TLV for a Tunnel Type<br>&nbsp;  that does not use the corresponding outer encapsulation, the sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  MUST be treated as if it were an unknown type of sub-TLV.<br><br>nit: this is the only instance of "unknown" in the document; using<br>"unrecognized" seems to be the common case (and makes it easier to find<br>Section 13).<br><br>Section 3.3.1<br><br>I think we may need to discuss the semantics of the DS field here -- as<br>I understand it, the attribute advertised in this TLV is the DSCP value<br>that the BGP speaker would like to receive in traffic destined to the<br>tunnel egress endpoint (which may be a different node than the BGP<br>speaker itself, but is expected to be under the control of the same<br>administrative entity).&nbsp; Additionally, the interpretation of DSCP values<br>is subject to local interpretation on a given network.&nbsp; Since the tunnel<br>encapsulation attribute is transitive, it will be propagated potentially<br>across multiple BGP hops and multiple ASes, so that the tunnel ingress<br>endpoint is not necessarily adjacent to the tunnel egress endpoint.<br>Although we do say that we expect the tunnel encapsulation information<br>to only be propagated within an administrative boundary, there is no<br>guarantee that the administrative boundary in question uses a unified<br>DSCP handling procedure throughout it.&nbsp; As such, it may be possible to<br>end up in a regime where the requested DSCP codepoint has a different,<br>and potentially hazardous, interpretation, at the ingress of the tunnel.<br>So, it seems that we need to say something about either local policy for<br>DSCP value filtering, or only using this value when "directly" connected<br>to the egress AS, or similar; we do have something like this already for<br>the TC portion of the MPLS label stack entries.<br><br>Section 3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  labeled address family, then the sub-TLV MUST be disregarded.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  sub-TLV is contained in a TLV whose Tunnel Type does not have a<br>&nbsp;  virtual network identifier in its encapsulation header, the sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  MUST be disregarded.&nbsp; In those cases where the sub-TLV is ignored, it<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD NOT be stripped from the TLV before the route is propagated.<br><br>Why only SHOULD NOT here?&nbsp; I thought we hat MUST-level requirements to<br>preserve things unchaged in similar situations.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In the remainder of this specification, when a route is referred to<br>&nbsp;  as containing a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute with a TLV identifying<br>&nbsp;  a particular Tunnel Type, it implicitly includes the case where the<br>&nbsp;  route contains a Tunnel Encapsulation Extended Community identifying<br>&nbsp;  that Tunnel Type.<br><br>I searched the entire document for the string "identifying" and did not<br>find any instances where a route was referred to as containing a Tunenl<br>Encapsulation attribute with a TLV identifying a particular tunnel type.<br>Perhaps I should be looking for the "attribute" keyword, but there are<br>over 200 instances of that string; could you confirm whether this<br>implicit inclusion is actually used anywhere (and if so, give an example<br>of such usage)?<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC5512</a>] specifies the use of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute in<br>&nbsp;  BGP UPDATE messages of AFI/SAFI 1/7 and 2/7.&nbsp; That document restricts<br>&nbsp;  the use of this attribute to UPDATE messages of those SAFIs.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  document removes that restriction.<br><br>I believe another reviewer commented on the ambiguity of "that", which I<br>first thought referred to "this" vs "that"; I now see that there is<br>additional ambituity as to whether it is the SAFI restriction or the<br>UPDATE message restriction that is lifted, and suggest clarification<br>of that as well.<br><br>&nbsp;  Once it is determined to send a packet through the tunnel specified<br>&nbsp;  in a particular Tunnel TLV of a particular Tunnel Encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  attribute, then the tunnel's egress endpoint address is the IP<br>&nbsp;  address contained in the sub-TLV.&nbsp; If the Tunnel TLV contains a<br><br>nit: I think we have to say "Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV"; the use of<br>the definite article is not justified by the preceding context.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  However, suppose that one of the TLVs in U2's Tunnel Encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  attribute contains the Color Sub-TLV.&nbsp; In that case, packet P MUST<br>&nbsp;  NOT be sent through the tunnel contained in that TLV, unless U1 is<br>&nbsp;  carrying the Color Extended Community that is identified in U2's<br>&nbsp;  Color Sub-TLV.<br><br>We should probably reword this in light of Section 13's discussion that<br>a given Tunnel TLV can have more than one Color sub-TLV present.<br><br>Section 9.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Three of the tunnel types that can be specified in a Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation TLV have virtual network identifier fields in their<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation headers.&nbsp; In the VXLAN encapsulation, this field is<br>&nbsp;  called the VNI (Virtual Network Identifier) field; in the NVGRE<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation, this field is called the VSID (Virtual Subnet<br>&nbsp;  Identifier) field.<br><br>We start off by saying "three" types but list only two.&nbsp; What's the<br>third type?<br><br>Section 9.2.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the TLV identifying the tunnel does not contain an Encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  sub-TLV whose V bit is set, the virtual network identifier field of<br>&nbsp;  the encapsulation header is set as follows:<br><br>This perhaps sets us up for a nasty surprise in light of the<br>error-handling behavior in §13, where we are supposed to disregard the<br>second and subsequent instances of the Encapsulation sub-TLV.&nbsp; This<br>language is not particularly clear about whether it applies to only the<br>first sub-TLV or all instances.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; If the TLV does not contain an Embedded Label Handling sub-TLV, or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if it contains an Embedded Label Handling sub-TLV whose value is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2, the embedded label is copied into the lower 3 octets of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; virtual network identifier field of the encapsulation header.<br><br>nit: I think "lower" is unneeded, since all the VNI fields are exactly 3<br>octets now.<br><br>Section 10<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that if the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is attached to a VPN-<br>&nbsp;  IP route [<a href="/doc/rfc4364/">RFC4364</a>], and if Inter-AS "option b" (see section 10 of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4364/">RFC4364</a>]) is being used, and if the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV<br>&nbsp;  contains an IP address that is not in same AS as the router receiving<br>&nbsp;  the route, it is very likely that the embedded label has been<br>&nbsp;  changed.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure that I'm understanding this scenario properly.&nbsp; The label<br>has been "changed" with respect to what baseline?&nbsp; I'm also not sure why<br>the tunnel egress endpoint would need to be in the same AS as the router<br>receiving (vs originating) the route.<br><br>&nbsp;  Other documents may define other ways to signal tunnel information in<br>&nbsp;  BGP.&nbsp; For example, [<a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>] defines the "P-Multicast Service<br>&nbsp;  Interface Tunnel" (PMSI Tunnel) attribute.&nbsp; In this specification, we<br>&nbsp;  do not consider the effects of advertising the Tunnel Encapsulation<br>&nbsp;  Attribute in conjunction with other forms of signaling tunnels.&nbsp; Any<br>&nbsp;  document specifying such joint use should provide details as to how<br>&nbsp;  interactions should be handled.<br><br>It seems like we should perhaps go a step further and explicitly<br>recommend not advertising such combinations in the absence of a<br>specification for their combined use?&nbsp; Otherwise implementations will<br>have to come up with their own interpretations, which could easily be<br>uninteroperable.<br><br>Section 13<br><br>&nbsp;  The following sub-TLVs defined in this document MUST NOT occur more<br>&nbsp;  than once in a given Tunnel TLV: Tunnel Egress Endpoint (discussed<br>&nbsp;  below), Encapsulation, DS, UDP Destination Port, Embedded Label<br>&nbsp;  Handling, MPLS Label Stack, Prefix-SID.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Ah, thanks for listing these out.&nbsp; I had been wondering about this<br>situation earlier in the doc, and it would have helped if the "not more<br>than once" limitation was mentioned at each sub-TLV's definition (even<br>if the actual error handling stays here).<br><br>Section 14.3<br><br>Why do we only move "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs" (but<br>not "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types") to the new "BGP<br>Tunnel Encapsulation Parameters" grouping?<br><br>Section 14.9<br><br>It might be useful to indicate in the registry metadata how many flags<br>are available (and, I suppose, in which order the bits are numbered).<br><br>Section 15<br><br>We briefly discuss in the main body text the possibility that a tunnel<br>will direct encapsulated traffic with (e.g) MPLS labels to a node that<br>will misinterpret those labels; it might be worth reiterating the risk<br>of such misinterpretation in the security considerations as well (or<br>just referencing the previous discussion as security-relevant).<br><br>I guess there's also a theoretical possibility that the flexibility in<br>tunnel specification (including the type of expected content) could<br>facilitate cross-protocol attacks, where the attacker causes the sender<br>and recipient of encapsulated traffic to think that they should<br>interpret the records in question as different protocols.&nbsp; But this<br>seems so remote, and unlikely to succeed given different protocols'<br>message structure, that it is probably not worth mentioning.<br><br>Section 18.2<br><br>If we're using <a href="/doc/rfc5462/">RFC 5462</a> as a reference for a field in an MPLS label,<br>that seems to make it normative.<br><br>We seem to depend on procedures from <a href="/doc/rfc6811/">RFC 6811</a> in a few places, which<br>also seems to make it normative.</div></td>

I find it a little surprising as it describes the protocol that this document obsoletes... I would have preferred an abstract describing what this document does w/o citing <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> (except of course at the end of the abstract).<br><br>-- Section 1.4 --<br><br>It is a little unclear what "these deficiencies" are ? Perhaps add a reference to previous section 1.2 ?<br><br>-- Section 3 --<br>Would it be easier for the reader to either have a summary table of all sub-TLV types or repeat the type code in all sub-section headings?<br><br>-- Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 --<br>While the assumption of a 48-bit MAC address is correct in 2020 (barring FireWire, IEEE 802.5.14), it also limits the usability of this document to a set of data-link layers.<br><br>Should the length of the "Reserved" field be specified ?<br><br>-- Section 3.3 --<br>Should the value of IPv6 Flow Label or any IPv6 extension header (e.g., hop by hop or destination headers) be specified ?<br><br>-- Section 3.6 --<br>If not mistaken, <a href="/doc/rfc8669/">RFC 8669</a> is only about SR-MPLS. So, I wonder whether the authors also think to add a similar feature for SRv6 ?<br><br>-- Sections 5 &amp; 12 --<br>Unsure whether this paragraph is really useful, isn't it implicit ? (I am of course fine in either case)<br><br>== NITS ==<br><br>I find the choice of "encapsulation sub-TLV" a poor choice as it can easily be confused with "encapsulation TLV" (section 2) but I guess the train has left the station ;-)</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the "Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation Attribute".&nbsp; This attribute allows one to specify a set<br>&nbsp;  of tunnels.&nbsp; For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide the<br>&nbsp;  information needed to create the tunnel and the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation header.&nbsp; The attribute can also provide information<br>&nbsp;  that aids in choosing whether a particular packet is to be sent<br>&nbsp;  through a particular tunnel.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> states that the attribute is<br>&nbsp;  only carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the "Encapsulation Subsequent<br>&nbsp;  Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)".&nbsp; This document deprecates the<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used in production), and<br>&nbsp;  specifies semantics for the attribute when it is carried in UPDATEs<br>&nbsp;  of certain other SAFIs.&nbsp; This document adds support for additional<br>&nbsp;  tunnel types, and allows a remote tunnel endpoint address to be<br>&nbsp;  specified for each tunnel.&nbsp; This document also provides support for<br>&nbsp;  specifying fields of any inner or outer encapsulations that may be<br>&nbsp;  used by a particular tunnel.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote". That discussion can be found, in part, at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA</a><br>	Although it sprawled across a few threads, this is the one that concludes <br>	them.

This includes a review of the current version.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The document shepherd took a fresh review of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This review took the followinng steps: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Examination of the technology within its use cases,&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the RFC deprecated (<a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5566/">RFC5566</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5640/">RFC5640</a>), <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  any RFC related to this work (<a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC7510</a>) or with an alternate <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel approach with BGP support (PMSI, <a href="/doc/rfc8365/">RFC8365</a>).&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The list of drafts related to PMSI approach included<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  many of the MVPN and EVPn work done by L3VPN, L2VPN or BESS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC7432</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc8277/">RFC8277</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7153/">RFC7153</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC7432</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7524/">RFC 7524</a>, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7716/">RFC7716</a>,. <a href="/doc/rfc7988/">RFC7988</a>), and the EVPN <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  BESS drafts approved for publication <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement/">draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement</a>).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Exmination of the use of tunnels for NSH control <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plane for SFC .&nbsp;  BESS has approved <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drafts-ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane-18 for <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; publication.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Examination of IDR Drafts approved for publication <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for BGP-LS/Segment Routing and flow specification&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (draft-ietf-bgp-ls-sgement-routing-ext-16.txt<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  draft-ietf-bgpls-segment-routing-epe-19.txt, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis.txt</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  4) The shepherd also examined all drafts adopted by <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BESS and IDR for interactions with the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encapsulation specification.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  5) The shepherd also reviewd the -19.txt version for textual consistency. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shepherd wrote up the results in a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  16 page write-up that was sent to Alvaro, John Scudder and the author group. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A majority of the write-up was a report on the RFC and drafts in BESS and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IDR described above.&nbsp; The report indicated 6 technical <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  points plus editorial points.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  -20.txt addressed technical and editorial points in the write-up. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The tunnel-encapsulation work and related work in VPNs, (IP-VPNs, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; EVPNs, M-VPNs, etc) stands on the shoulders of work in IDR, L3VPN, L2VPN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; BESS.&nbsp; The authors have carefully inserted the GP tunnel-encapsulation <br>&nbsp;  attribute into this complex set of VPN technology.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  This draft provides a careful insertion with notes on what RFCs are<br>&nbsp;  obsoleted.&nbsp; The shpeherd notes that other VPN drafts&nbsp; (EVPN, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; VPN for SFC, NVO3 VPN, M-VPN, SR VPNs)&nbsp; that rely on tunnels&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; need to be as careful in their examination of the existing technology. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a WG chair of IDR, this shepherd will pass along the insights learned <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to IDR and BESS chairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The second shepherd has worked with 3 proposals for replacement of the <br>&nbsp;  secure IP-VPN tunnel type using the tunnel-encapsulation for 3 years.&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; These implementations have three different types of <br>&nbsp; application (within an AS or AS-Confederation,&nbsp; SDWAN, and <br>&nbsp; Secure E-VPN.&nbsp;  The proposed implementations were vetted by the <br> security experts at an open meeting at IETF 104.&nbsp;  <br> This work in secure IP-VPN is moving slower than the general <br>&nbsp; tunnel-encapsulation.&nbsp;  Since IDR requires 2 implementations to <br>&nbsp; forward drafts to the IESG, the IP-in IP tunnel with IPSec transport <br>&nbsp; and the MPLS-in-IP tunnel with IPsec Transport were deprecated. <br>&nbsp; It is expected that the replacement for these deprecated functions <br>&nbsp; will eventually mature to the point of having 2 interoperable implementations&nbsp; <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	No.&nbsp;  <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>	No.&nbsp;  IETF LC reviews were request for Internet Directorate (tunnel MTUs), <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Op/NM directorate, Security Directorate and Transport Directorate.&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  All directorate reviews received have been addressed by -20.txt. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The security directorate reviewed has not completed the review as of 11/6/2020. <br><br>	<br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it.

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote".

The relevant<br>	case in <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> is:<br><br>	&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; informational RFCs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> which currently lists its intended status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as "informational"; the authors and NVO3 chairs confirm this is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; correct. It's my opinion that this downref is ok in the spirit of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the above, even though the draft is an IETF product. Given that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encaps specification is extensible, it seems overly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; restrictive to prevent it from being extended to signal a particular<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation just because that encapsulation is specified in an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; informational document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Importantly, the "informational" references, while normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the sense that the specification can't be fully understood without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the references as well, are NOT required for the core<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements of the specification. It would be possible to produce an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; implementation of the specification that complies and interoperates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but doesn't support any of the encapsulations in the downref specs.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs?

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?&nbsp; Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC?&nbsp; Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>	Proposed Standard.<br><br>	The document defines procedures and operation for BGP.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the "Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation Attribute".&nbsp; This attribute allows one to specify a set<br>&nbsp;  of tunnels.&nbsp; For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide the<br>&nbsp;  information needed to create the tunnel and the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation header.&nbsp; The attribute can also provide information<br>&nbsp;  that aids in choosing whether a particular packet is to be sent<br>&nbsp;  through a particular tunnel.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> states that the attribute is<br>&nbsp;  only carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the "Encapsulation Subsequent<br>&nbsp;  Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)".&nbsp; This document deprecates the<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used in production), and<br>&nbsp;  specifies semantics for the attribute when it is carried in UPDATEs<br>&nbsp;  of certain other SAFIs.&nbsp; This document adds support for additional<br>&nbsp;  tunnel types, and allows a remote tunnel endpoint address to be<br>&nbsp;  specified for each tunnel.&nbsp; This document also provides support for<br>&nbsp;  specifying fields of any inner or outer encapsulations that may be<br>&nbsp;  used by a particular tunnel.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote". That discussion can be found, in part, at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA</a><br>	Although it sprawled across a few threads, this is the one that concludes <br>	them. The authors eventually decided to revise their terminology to <br>	change "remote tunnel endpoint" to "tunnel egress endpoint" in -13; this<br>	settled the issue.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John Scudder, the initial WG shepherd, added so much in the editorial process <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that the co-authors felt John should be a co-author.&nbsp;  Due to this the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Shepherd was changed to Susan Hares with version 19 (-19.txt).&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Susan Hares did a fresh analysis of the internet draft.&nbsp;  <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 	The IDR implementation report page is at<br>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps%20implementations">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps%20implementations</a><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br>&nbsp; 	<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The initial document shepherd was John Scudder <br>&nbsp; 	The current document shepherd is Susan Hares. <br>&nbsp; 	The responsible AD is Alvaro Retana.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>	The document shepherd has read the draft in detail several times<br>	during the course of its development, and worked with the authors to<br>	address comments. This includes a review of the current version.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The document shepherd took a fresh review of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This review took the followinng steps: <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Examination of the technology within its use cases,&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the RFC deprecated (<a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5566/">RFC5566</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5640/">RFC5640</a>), <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  any RFC related to this work (<a href="/doc/rfc7510/">RFC7510</a>) or with an alternate <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel approach with BGP support (PMSI, <a href="/doc/rfc8365/">RFC8365</a>).&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The list of drafts related to PMSI approach included<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  many of the MVPN and EVPn work done by L3VPN, L2VPN or BESS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC7432</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc8277/">RFC8277</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7153/">RFC7153</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC7432</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc7524/">RFC 7524</a>, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7716/">RFC7716</a>,. <a href="/doc/rfc7988/">RFC7988</a>), and the EVPN <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  BESS drafts approved for publication <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement/">draft-ietf-bess-evpn-prefix-advertisement</a>).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Exmination of the use of tunnels for NSH control <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plane for SFC .&nbsp;  BESS has approved <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drafts-ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane-18 for <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; publication.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Examination of IDR Drafts approved for publication <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for BGP-LS/Segment Routing and flow specification&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (draft-ietf-bgp-ls-sgement-routing-ext-16.txt<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  draft-ietf-bgpls-segment-routing-epe-19.txt, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis/">draft-ietf-idr-rfc5575bis.txt</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  4) The shepherd also examined all drafts adopted by <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BESS and IDR for interactions with the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encapsulation specification.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  5) The shepherd also reviewd the -19.txt version for textual consistency. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shepherd wrote up the results in a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  16 page write-up that was sent to Alvaro, John Scudder and the author group. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A majority of the write-up was a report on the RFC and drafts in BESS and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  IDR described above.&nbsp; The report indicated 6 technical <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  points plus editorial points.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  -20.txt addressed technical and editorial points in the write-up. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The tunnel-encapsulation work and related work in VPNs, (IP-VPNs, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; EVPNs, M-VPNs, etc) stands on the shoulders of work in IDR, L3VPN, L2VPN<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; BESS.&nbsp; The authors have carefully inserted the GP tunnel-encapsulation <br>&nbsp;  attribute into this complex set of VPN technology.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  This draft provides a careful insertion with notes on what RFCs are<br>&nbsp;  obsoleted.&nbsp; The shpeherd notes that other VPN drafts&nbsp; (EVPN, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; VPN for SFC, NVO3 VPN, M-VPN, SR VPNs)&nbsp; that rely on tunnels&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; need to be as careful in their examination of the existing technology. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a WG chair of IDR, this shepherd will pass along the insights learned <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; to IDR and BESS chairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  The second shepherd has worked with 3 proposals for replacement of the <br>&nbsp;  secure IP-VPN tunnel type using the tunnel-encapsulation for 3 years.&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; These implementations have three different types of <br>&nbsp; application (within an AS or AS-Confederation,&nbsp; SDWAN, and <br>&nbsp; Secure E-VPN.&nbsp;  The proposed implementations were vetted by the <br> security experts at an open meeting at IETF 104.&nbsp;  <br> This work in secure IP-VPN is moving slower than the general <br>&nbsp; tunnel-encapsulation.&nbsp;  Since IDR requires 2 implementations to <br>&nbsp; forward drafts to the IESG, the IP-in IP tunnel with IPSec transport <br>&nbsp; and the MPLS-in-IP tunnel with IPsec Transport were deprecated. <br>&nbsp; It is expected that the replacement for these deprecated functions <br>&nbsp; will eventually mature to the point of having 2 interoperable implementations&nbsp; <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	No.&nbsp;  <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>	No.&nbsp;  IETF LC reviews were request for Internet Directorate (tunnel MTUs), <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Op/NM directorate, Security Directorate and Transport Directorate.&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  All directorate reviews received have been addressed by -20.txt. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The security directorate reviewed has not completed the review as of 11/6/2020. <br><br>	<br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>	None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

See answer to (15).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  See resolution in (15). <br>&nbsp;  <br>	<br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>	N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>	Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Original shephred (John Scudder): <br>	Yes, there is a reference to draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The NVO3 chairs state that their WG plans to advance this draft<br>	following advancement of Geneve, and that Geneve has been <br>	sent to the IESG for advancement. So, it appears GPE will be<br>	ready for advancement soon.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sue:&nbsp; Advancement is slow so John Scudder and Author team <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will move draft--ietf-nv03-vxlan-gpe out of document in next revision. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure.&nbsp;  <br><br> (See two note sections denoted as Note 1 and Note 2) <br><br>&nbsp; Note 1: during IETF LC&nbsp; <br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7348/">RFC 7348</a> ("Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A<br>	&nbsp; Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer<br>	&nbsp; 3 Networks")<br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC 7637</a> ("NVGRE: Network Virtualization Using Generic Routing<br>	&nbsp; Encapsulation")<br>	o <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> ("Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN")<br><br>	The first two are Informational, ISE stream documents. The relevant<br>	case in <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> is:<br><br>	&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; informational RFCs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> which currently lists its intended status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as "informational"; the authors and NVO3 chairs confirm this is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; correct. It's my opinion that this downref is ok in the spirit of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the above, even though the draft is an IETF product. Given that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encaps specification is extensible, it seems overly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; restrictive to prevent it from being extended to signal a particular<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation just because that encapsulation is specified in an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; informational document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Importantly, the "informational" references, while normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the sense that the specification can't be fully understood without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the references as well, are NOT required for the core<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements of the specification. It would be possible to produce an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; implementation of the specification that complies and interoperates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but doesn't support any of the encapsulations in the downref specs.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note 2: Post IETF L process: <br>&nbsp;  After IETF LC,&nbsp; the authors have agreed to move out<br>&nbsp; this these two references into another document.&nbsp; <br> <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc5566/">RFC5566</a>, and <a href="/doc/rfc5640/">RFC5640</a> are obsoleted <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the reasons adequately discussed. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc8365/">RFC8365</a>] references <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> for its definition of the BGP<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation Extended Community.&nbsp;  The impact of deprecating <br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC5512</a> is discussed in Appendix A.&nbsp;  A RFC8365bis is recommended. <br> <br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document.

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the "Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation Attribute".&nbsp; This attribute allows one to specify a set<br>&nbsp;  of tunnels.&nbsp; For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide the<br>&nbsp;  information needed to create the tunnel and the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation header.&nbsp; The attribute can also provide information<br>&nbsp;  that aids in choosing whether a particular packet is to be sent<br>&nbsp;  through a particular tunnel.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> states that the attribute is<br>&nbsp;  only carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the "Encapsulation Subsequent<br>&nbsp;  Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)".&nbsp; This document deprecates the<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used in production), and<br>&nbsp;  specifies semantics for the attribute when it is carried in UPDATEs<br>&nbsp;  of certain other SAFIs.&nbsp; This document adds support for additional<br>&nbsp;  tunnel types, and allows a remote tunnel endpoint address to be<br>&nbsp;  specified for each tunnel.&nbsp; This document also provides support for<br>&nbsp;  specifying fields of any inner or outer encapsulations that may be<br>&nbsp;  used by a particular tunnel.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote".

So, it appears GPE will be<br>	ready for advancement soon.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7348/">RFC 7348</a> ("Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A<br>	&nbsp; Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer<br>	&nbsp; 3 Networks")<br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC 7637</a> ("NVGRE: Network Virtualization Using Generic Routing<br>	&nbsp; Encapsulation")<br>	o <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> ("Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN")<br><br>	The first two are Informational, ISE stream documents. The relevant<br>	case in <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> is:<br><br>	&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; informational RFCs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> which currently lists its intended status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as "informational"; the authors and NVO3 chairs confirm this is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; correct. It's my opinion that this downref is ok in the spirit of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the above, even though the draft is an IETF product. Given that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encaps specification is extensible, it seems overly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; restrictive to prevent it from being extended to signal a particular<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation just because that encapsulation is specified in an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; informational document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Importantly, the "informational" references, while normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the sense that the specification can't be fully understood without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the references as well, are NOT required for the core<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements of the specification. It would be possible to produce an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; implementation of the specification that complies and interoperates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but doesn't support any of the encapsulations in the downref specs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs?

For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote".

This includes a review of the current version.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>	No.<br>	<br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of?

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>	No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>	Note that the idnits error about an IPv4 address is bogus, <br>	idnits is confusing a section reference (9.1.2.1) for an IP<br>	address, possibly because of where the line break is?<br>	<br>	Idnits complains about downrefs.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>	Yes, there is a reference to draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe. The <br>	NVO3 chairs state that their WG plans to advance this draft<br>	following advancement of Geneve, and that Geneve has been <br>	sent to the IESG for advancement. So, it appears GPE will be<br>	ready for advancement soon.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7348/">RFC 7348</a> ("Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A<br>	&nbsp; Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer<br>	&nbsp; 3 Networks")<br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC 7637</a> ("NVGRE: Network Virtualization Using Generic Routing<br>	&nbsp; Encapsulation")<br>	o <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> ("Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN")<br><br>	The first two are Informational, ISE stream documents. The relevant<br>	case in <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> is:<br><br>	&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; informational RFCs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> which currently lists its intended status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as "informational"; the authors and NVO3 chairs confirm this is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; correct. It's my opinion that this downref is ok in the spirit of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the above, even though the draft is an IETF product. Given that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encaps specification is extensible, it seems overly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; restrictive to prevent it from being extended to signal a particular<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation just because that encapsulation is specified in an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; informational document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Importantly, the "informational" references, while normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the sense that the specification can't be fully understood without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the references as well, are NOT required for the core<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements of the specification. It would be possible to produce an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; implementation of the specification that complies and interoperates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but doesn't support any of the encapsulations in the downref specs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> is obsoleted and the reasons adequately <br>	discussed.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>	Confirmed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>	N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>	N/A</div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> defines a BGP Path Attribute known as the "Tunnel<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation Attribute".&nbsp; This attribute allows one to specify a set<br>&nbsp;  of tunnels.&nbsp; For each such tunnel, the attribute can provide the<br>&nbsp;  information needed to create the tunnel and the corresponding<br>&nbsp;  encapsulation header.&nbsp; The attribute can also provide information<br>&nbsp;  that aids in choosing whether a particular packet is to be sent<br>&nbsp;  through a particular tunnel.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> states that the attribute is<br>&nbsp;  only carried in BGP UPDATEs that have the "Encapsulation Subsequent<br>&nbsp;  Address Family (Encapsulation SAFI)".&nbsp; This document deprecates the<br>&nbsp;  Encapsulation SAFI (which has never been used in production), and<br>&nbsp;  specifies semantics for the attribute when it is carried in UPDATEs<br>&nbsp;  of certain other SAFIs.&nbsp; This document adds support for additional<br>&nbsp;  tunnel types, and allows a remote tunnel endpoint address to be<br>&nbsp;  specified for each tunnel.&nbsp; This document also provides support for<br>&nbsp;  specifying fields of any inner or outer encapsulations that may be<br>&nbsp;  used by a particular tunnel.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br>&nbsp; <br>	The document went through two full WGLCs. The first one, for draft<br>	-04, generated a substantial amount of discussion.&nbsp; It concluded on<br>	June 9, 2017 without consensus to proceed, but did result in<br>	extensive review and discussion, with all points that were raised<br>	either being reflected in the later versions of the draft, or<br>	otherwise resolved. The chairs' summary of the WGLC is at<br>	<a href="https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html">https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/idr/current/msg18246.html</a><br>	<br>	The second one, for draft -07 (with cc OSPF and BESS since they both<br>	normatively reference the draft) concluded October 20, 2017 with some<br>	support and no dissent.&nbsp; Given the extensive review and discussion as<br>	part of the first WGLC, the chairs were satisified with this outcome.<br>	<br>	Subsequent to the second WGLC, further issues were reported by<br>	implementors (this is why IDR has an implementation requirement!).<br>	Some issues also were found by the document shepherd in the course<br>	of preparing this report. The related updates brought the draft<br>	version up to -12. We had an "additional comment period" to allow<br>	the WG to raise any concerns related to the changes, the thread can<br>	be found at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=3_Fmk0Ble3VaAaDzAqt7heOpfc4</a><br>	<br>	Finally, an editorial issue was surfaced in the course of <br>	a WG discussion about a number of different SD-WAN related proposals.<br>	A number of readers considered the use of the term "remote tunnel endpoint"<br>	confusing since it wasn't clear from what point of view the tunnel was <br>	considered "remote". That discussion can be found, in part, at<br>	<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/idr/?gbt=1&amp;index=vPmpkz7tPWfo0laWHRtLayMF5ZA</a><br>	Although it sprawled across a few threads, this is the one that concludes <br>	them. The authors eventually decided to revise their terminology to <br>	change "remote tunnel endpoint" to "tunnel egress endpoint" in -13; this<br>	settled the issue.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 	The IDR implementation report page is at<br>&nbsp; 	<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps%20implementations">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/idr/wiki/draft-ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps%20implementations</a><br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br>&nbsp; 	<br>&nbsp; 	The document shepherd is John Scudder.<br>&nbsp; 	The responsible AD is Alvaro Retana.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>	The document shepherd has read the draft in detail several times<br>	during the course of its development, and worked with the authors to<br>	address comments. This includes a review of the current version.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>	No.<br>	<br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>	None.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>	Considering the amount of conversation on the mailing list and<br>	at the in-person meetings, discussed above under "working group<br>	summary", I'd say it has broad consensus.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>	No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>	Note that the idnits error about an IPv4 address is bogus, <br>	idnits is confusing a section reference (9.1.2.1) for an IP<br>	address, possibly because of where the line break is?<br>	<br>	Idnits complains about downrefs. See answer to (15).<br>	<br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>	N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>	Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>	Yes, there is a reference to draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe. The <br>	NVO3 chairs state that their WG plans to advance this draft<br>	following advancement of Geneve, and that Geneve has been <br>	sent to the IESG for advancement. So, it appears GPE will be<br>	ready for advancement soon.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7348/">RFC 7348</a> ("Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN): A<br>	&nbsp; Framework for Overlaying Virtualized Layer 2 Networks over Layer<br>	&nbsp; 3 Networks")<br>	o <a href="/doc/rfc7637/">RFC 7637</a> ("NVGRE: Network Virtualization Using Generic Routing<br>	&nbsp; Encapsulation")<br>	o <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> ("Generic Protocol Extension for VXLAN")<br><br>	The first two are Informational, ISE stream documents. The relevant<br>	case in <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> is:<br><br>	&nbsp;  o&nbsp; A standards document may need to refer to a proprietary protocol,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the IETF normally documents proprietary protocols using<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; informational RFCs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe</a> which currently lists its intended status<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as "informational"; the authors and NVO3 chairs confirm this is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; correct. It's my opinion that this downref is ok in the spirit of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the above, even though the draft is an IETF product. Given that the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; tunnel-encaps specification is extensible, it seems overly<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; restrictive to prevent it from being extended to signal a particular<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; encapsulation just because that encapsulation is specified in an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; informational document. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Importantly, the "informational" references, while normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the sense that the specification can't be fully understood without<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the references as well, are NOT required for the core<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements of the specification. It would be possible to produce an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; implementation of the specification that complies and interoperates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; but doesn't support any of the encapsulations in the downref specs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc5512/">RFC 5512</a> is obsoleted and the reasons adequately <br>	discussed.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>	Confirmed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>	N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>	N/A</div></td>
