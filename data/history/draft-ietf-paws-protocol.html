 I am leaving them here for reference.<br><br>Section 3 describes spectrum-usage messages as purely informational.&nbsp;  Section 4.5 says that the database can require that such messages be sent.&nbsp;  Which is it: is it sometimes required, or always purely informational?&nbsp;  Or does "purely informational" just mean that the protocol provides no mechanism for tracking such notifications?&nbsp; It would be helpful if this were clearer.<br><br>In 4.1, the database URI change spec seems incomplete.&nbsp;  Is there a time when a database starts announcing its URI change after which it need no longer provide service on the old URI?&nbsp;  I see Alissa asked a similar question, so I imagine you could address both questions together.<br><br>In 4.1 and 5.17, the meaning described for UNSUPPORTED appears to be somewhat fluid.&nbsp;  I think you intend for it to mean one specific thing, which might imply one of several other things.&nbsp;  But you don't say the one thing that it means: instead you mention possible implications.&nbsp;  It would be helpful to try to make this more explicit.<br><br>I think Stephen noticed this same problem, but to be clear, it appears that section 4.5 says that when the master is sending a request on behalf of a slave, it sends its own location.&nbsp;  But section 4.5.1 says that the master sends the slave's location.&nbsp;  It appears that there are two parameters, one being the master location, which is required, and the other being the slave location, which is optional.&nbsp;  However, this is never really stated explicitly; it might be helpful if it were.<br><br>I have to confess that the use of "master" and "slave" throughout this document makes me quite uncomfortable in reading it.&nbsp;  It would really be preferable to use terms that have less painful history associated with them, like "core" and "leaf" or "coordinator" and "supplicant."&nbsp;  I realize this is a matter of taste, and I do not at all mean to suggest that there's anything wrong with the use of these terms, which are certainly common in the computing industry.&nbsp;  This is just a comment, and whether you address it is entirely up to you.<br><br>In 4.6.1, it would help to have text that explains what it means to validate a device.&nbsp;  It's certainly not required for interoperability, but might be helpful for implementors of database servers.<br><br>In 5.3, it's a little puzzling that antenna direction, radiation pattern, gain and polarization aren't defined, because they seem like properties that should have universal applicability, even if they are not required in all cases.&nbsp;  Is this being left as future work, or is there some more subtle reason why these haven't been defined explicitly?<br><br>In 5.11, power is expressed in dbm, which leads me to wonder if this is the product of the antenna gain and the input power to the output amplifier, or whether it's just the input power to the amplifier, or whether it's being left intentionally ambiguous.<br><br>Former DISCUSS points:<br><br>This is a cool document—I'm glad the IETF is working on this.&nbsp;  Please don't take the following comments as anything other than an attempt to address what I think are some relatively minor issues with the document, hopefully easily addressed.<br><br>4.1 says "Some regulatory domains may have specific rules regarding how long the spectrum data remains valid in these cases."&nbsp;  It might be worth adding that in such cases the initialization procedure is required.&nbsp;  This is addressed to some extent in section 4.3, but I'm not sure it's completely addressed.&nbsp;  The potential problem I see is that a device might be used in a regulatory regime where this is required, but might have pre-configured values for some other regulatory regime.&nbsp;  If these values are not valid in the regime that applies for its current location, it might have a too-long refresh interval configured, fail to detect that this is the case, and as a result accidentally break the law.&nbsp;  Can a scenario like this occur in practice?<br><br>Section 5.2 says that the manufacturer ID and model ID are optional, but may be required by some rulesets.&nbsp;  Section 4.3.1 does not say what error is returned when a deviceDesc that does not contain one or both of these parameters is sent to the server, but the matching ruleset requires either parameter.&nbsp;  I suspect the answer is straightforward, but I think it needs to be stated explicitly in 4.3.1.&nbsp;  E.g., if the optional but required parameters are accepted in the initialization but rejected in the registration, it would be good to say so explicitly.<br><br>In 4.4.2, I think that if none of the rulesets are accepted, the intent is that the database should return a REGISTRATION_RESP with the error element, and will not return a rulesetInfos list.&nbsp;  However, the specification does not make an exception for this case when it says "A RulesetInfo list MUST be included" and&nbsp; "The list MUST contain at least one entry".&nbsp;  I can't think of another valid interpretation, but you've stated a MUST, so you need to say that it doesn't apply in the case of the error.<br><br>In 4.5:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If some<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  locations within a batch request are outside the regulatory<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  domain supported by the Database, the Database MAY return an OK<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  response with available spectrum for only the valid locations;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  otherwise, if all locations within a batch request are outside<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the regulatory domain, the Database MUST respond with an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  OUTSIDE_COVERAGE error.<br><br>What should the database do if it doesn't follow the MAY?&nbsp;  Should it return an OUTSIDE_COVERAGE error?&nbsp;  It seems to me that this MAY is going to require some unclear heuristics on the side of the master device.&nbsp;  Why isn't this a MUST?&nbsp;  I think if this were a MUST, it would be clear how implementations should behave; by making it a MAY, there's a big gap that I think will lead to interoperability problems as different implementors make different choices about how to treat this situation.</div></td>

Were all three discussed in the WG?<br><br>= Section 4.1 =<br>"A Database MAY change its URI, but before it changes its URI, it MUST<br>&nbsp;  indicate so by including the URI of one or more alternate databases<br>&nbsp;  using DbUpdateSpec (Section 5.7) in its responses to devices."<br><br>The behavior here seems ambiguous. Does the database need to send responses containing the updated URI to all devices it has ever communicated with, or all registered devices, before it can actually change the URI? Does the database even maintain such lists? If not, how many such responses does it need to send out before changing its URI, or how long does it need to wait? Just saying that sending the new URI needs to happen "before" the URI changes does not seem specific enough for devices to know whether the URI has changed, or for databases to know when they can disable an old URI or stop sending the DbUpdateSpec indication.<br><br>= Section 4.5 =<br>These two sentences seem to contradict each other:<br><br>"The device identifier, capabilities, and characteristics<br>&nbsp;  communicated in the AVAIL_SPECTRUM_REQ message MUST be those of the<br>&nbsp;  Slave Device, but the location MUST be that of the Master Device."<br><br>"When the request is made by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Master Device on behalf of a Slave Device, the location is that of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Slave Device and it is OPTIONAL (see also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; masterDeviceLocation)."<br><br>Perhaps this can be solved by making the reference to "the location" in the first sentence more specific -- the masterDeviceLocation -- but I'm not really sure from reading the text.<br><br>Then later in the section, I started getting even more confused by this:<br><br>"When the request is made by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Master Device on behalf of a Slave Device, the location is that of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Slave Device and it is OPTIONAL (see also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; masterDeviceLocation).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>masterDeviceLocation:&nbsp; When the request is made by the Master Device<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on behalf of a Slave Device, the Master Device MAY provide its own<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GeoLocation (Section 5.1)."<br><br>Does this mean it's acceptable for a Master device acting on behalf of a Slave device to send neither the Slave device location (in the location parameter) nor the Master device location (in the masterDeviceLocation parameter)? I believe that the current text allows this. If so, why is location required in the registration step (and in batch available spectrum requests) but not in the available spectrum step? Seems like it should be the other way around -- that a device could register without specifying its location, but not request available spectrum without it. <br><br>If the above interpretation was not intended, something needs to be fixed in one part or the other of the above text to indicate that either the Master device location or the Slave device location (or both) must be present in the request.<br><br>The same issue arises in Section 4.5.5.<br><br>= Section 5.1 =<br>I'd like to discuss why the single point location format needs to be supported here. Is it really the case that a portion of whitespace spectrum will ever be available only at a single point, as opposed to a region? If not, it seems like sending a point (and, moreover, allowing region to be unsupported but not point) divulges more precise information about the requesting device than is ever actually necessary to fulfill the goals of this protocol. Do regulators require a single point? Why?<br><br>= Section 5.2 =<br>I'd like to discuss why the device serial number needs to be included in the device descriptor, rather than some (perhaps persistent) randomly generated device identifier that is used only in the context of this protocol (which would better protect the privacy of the user of the device, since the whitespaces database administrator wouldn't be able to correlate the device's spectrum requests with other activities linked to the serial number). It's not really clear why serial number is collected since both this document and <a href="/doc/rfc6953/">RFC 6953</a> note the protocol does not defend against abuse or mis-use of spectrum.<br><br>I'm asking the above two questions in light of requirement P.7 from <a href="/doc/rfc6953/">RFC 6953</a>, "The PAWS protocol SHOULD support privacy-sensitive handling of device-provided data where such protection is feasible, allowed, and desired."<br><br>A separate interesting question that does not seem to be addressed anywhere in the draft is whether a device can be fingerprinted by the database operator by virtue of the collection of elements it sends (rulesetIds, manufacturer, model, antenna characteristics, device capabilities, etc.) even if it doesn't send a serial number or device owner information that uniquely identify it. That seems worth discussion in Section 10.</div></td>

The FCC<br>may require those but why does the protocol? I don't see that<br>those are needed for interop. Isn't that latter the right<br>criterion for inclusion as a required field? I could see a<br>reason for the location-from-which-I-want-to-use-WS but that's<br>not what is described I think. The discuss here is both<br>relating to the privacy issues with requiring exposure of<br>identifying information but also relating to the criteria used<br>to determine required vs. optional and how those map to<br>interop vs. to current known sets of regulatory rules.&nbsp; (Same<br>for 5.2 serialNumber, though there a dynamic/random choice may<br>be needed instead.)<br><br>(2) 4.4.1 - is the location here the location of the device or<br>the location from which spectrum is to be used? I think you<br>need to disambiguate those. I continue to think there should<br>be a way to ask for spectrum in London, tomorrow; even whilst<br>still in Dublin, today. 4.5.1 seems to imply this may be<br>allowed sometimes, but I'm not clear if that works - how would<br>the "tomorrow" value be sent?<br><br>(3) Section 7: I think it'd be a good idea to either reference<br>the UTA TLS BCP for ciphersuites etc or else (if you'd rather<br>not have a dependency to another WG's I-D, which I'd<br>understand) to specify some here. The MTIs from 5246 are<br>looking pretty jaded right now. You may also want to mandate<br>use of OCSP or even stapling - there are a few more TLS things<br>you can do that help interop and to speed things up. I'm not<br>trying to insist you do/document all of those things, but<br>would like to chat about it for a bit.<br><br>(4) Section 7: You are assuming some kind of PKI is used to<br>authenticate DBs. Now that might work with the current Web<br>PKI, except that then any public Web PKI CA can fake any DB<br>but are regulator's ok with that? Secondly, TLS requires that<br>the DB nominate the acceptable CAs for client auth, so there's<br>a bit of specification missing here which is maybe that a DB's<br>description needs to include information about its acceptable<br>trust anchors. I don't think you necessarily need to fix all<br>of that in this document, but what is the plan here? (And<br>maybe some of it ought be fixed here, not sure.)</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br> Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to licensees are<br>&nbsp;  available for non-interfering use. Allowing secondary users access to available spectrum "unlocks" existing spectrum to maximize its utilization and to provide opportunities for innovation, resulting in greater overall spectrum utilization.<br> One approach to manage spectrum sharing uses databases to report spectrum availability to devices.&nbsp; To achieve interoperability among multiple devices and databases, a standardized protocol must be defined and implemented.&nbsp; This document defines such a protocol, the "Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS) Databases".<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>During the design of the protocol, in earlier phases, there was some controversy, even deadlock at some point over a few points. But things got sorted out, and for the last 3 versions of the document there were no substantial comments, the wg has consensus on the current content of the document.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>During private conversations, several mailing list members indicated to me that they have an implementation of a version of the protocol, but none came forward publicly with their implementations yet, and there was no request to hold an interop event.<br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>Document Shepherd is Gabor Bajko.<br>Responsible Area&nbsp; Director is Pete Resnick.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I reviewed the document and my comments were&nbsp; incorporated. It is the Document Shepherd's belief that the document is ready for IESG review.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>No. Several people reviewed the document.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>An in-depth review by a JSON expert might be useful. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>It is the Document Shepherd's understanding that the WG has consensus on the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.
