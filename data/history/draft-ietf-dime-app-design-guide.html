Ordinarily SHOULD and NOT are capitalized consistently, whether it's "should not" or "SHOULD NOT" and not "SHOULD not." But this is a fairly minor nit.<br><br>&nbsp;  Defining a command with most of the AVPs indicated as<br>&nbsp;  optional MUST NOT be seen as a sub-optimal design introducing too<br>&nbsp;  much flexibility in the protocol.<br><br>It's a little weird to use normative language to tell people how to think about something.&nbsp;  The use of normative language in this document in general is a bit challenging, but I think appropriate because you're specifying best practices for achieving interoperability.&nbsp;  But in this case I think you should not use normative language.&nbsp;  I'd word it this way:<br><br>&nbsp;  Defining a command with most of the AVPs indicated as<br>&nbsp;  optional is good design in many cases, despite the flexibility<br>&nbsp;  it introduces in the protocol.<br><br>Or just restate it as you did, but as a fact rather than an admonition about how to think.<br><br>And then:<br><br>&nbsp;  The protocol designers SHOULD only<br>&nbsp;  clearly state the condition of presence of these AVPs and properly<br>&nbsp;  define the corresponding behaviour of the Diameter nodes when these<br>&nbsp;  AVPs are absent from the command.<br><br>How about:<br><br>&nbsp;  Protocol designers SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  clearly state the reasons why these AVPs might or<br>&nbsp;  might not be present and properly define the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding behavior of the Diameter nodes<br>&nbsp;  when these AVPs are absent from the command.<br><br>And:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; As a hint for protocol designers, it is not sufficient to just<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; look at the command's CCF syntax specification.&nbsp; It is also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; necessary to carefully read through the accompanying text in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specification.<br><br>This looks like a hint for implementors, not protocol designers.&nbsp;  I am confused.&nbsp;  Do you mean that protocol designers should, when defining the spec, include a recommendation that implementors read the accompanying text as well as the CCF specification?<br><br>In 5.5:<br>&nbsp;  Based on these considerations, protocol designers SHOULD carefully<br>&nbsp;  appraise whether the application currently defined relies on its own<br>&nbsp;  session management concept or whether the Session-Id defined in the<br>&nbsp;  Diameter base protocol would be used for correlation of messages<br>&nbsp;  related to the same session.&nbsp; If not, the protocol designers MAY<br>&nbsp;  decide to define application commands without the Session-Id AVP.<br><br>This is stated in an overly detailed way, and "if not" is confusing, because the preceding statement contains two possibilities, neither of which is obviously negative.&nbsp;  It's clear on reflection what is meant, but it might be better stated something like this:<br><br>&nbsp;  Based on these considerations, protocol designers SHOULD carefully<br>&nbsp;  consider whether the application currently defined relies on its own<br>&nbsp;  session management concept.&nbsp; If not, the protocol designers MAY<br>&nbsp;  decide to define application commands without the Session-Id AVP,<br>&nbsp;  and rely on the Session-Id defined in the<br>&nbsp;  Diameter base protocol for correlation of messages<br>&nbsp;  related to the same session.<br><br>Also:<br>&nbsp;  If any session management concept is supported by the application, the<br>&nbsp;  application documentation MUST clearly specify how the session is<br>&nbsp;  handled between client and server (as possibly Diameter agents in the<br>&nbsp;  path).<br><br>Was that supposed to be "and possibly" rather than "as possibly"?<br><br>In 5.6:<br>&nbsp;  If such extension is<br>&nbsp;  foreseen or cannot be avoided, it is RECOMMENED to rather define AVPs<br>&nbsp;  of type Unsigned32 or Unsigned64 in which the data field would<br>&nbsp;  contain an address space representing "values" that would have the<br>&nbsp;  same use of Enumerated values.<br><br>It is not obvious to me why this is so.&nbsp;  It seems as if using an unsigned integer with some set of known values in application A, and then adding some new values to the same AVP in application B, is no different than defining an enumeration in application A with some set of possible values, and extending the enumeration in application B with some additional values.<br><br>I am sure that there is a reason why you have made this distinction, and I could take a guess as to what the reason is, but my point is that you should really just state what the reason is clearly in this section, rather than simply stating your conclusion, because as written the section is really puzzling to me, a reader who is not steeped in the traditions of Diameter.<br><br>In section 5.7:<br>&nbsp;  Whatever the criteria used to establish the routing path of the<br>&nbsp;  request, the routing of the answer MUST follow the reverse path of<br>&nbsp;  the request, as described in [<a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC6733</a>], with the answer being sent to<br>&nbsp;  the source of the received request, using transaction states and hop-<br>&nbsp;  by-hop identifier matching.&nbsp; In particular, this ensures that the<br>&nbsp;  Diameter Relay or Proxy agents in the request routing path will be<br>&nbsp;  able to release the transaction state upon receipt of the<br>&nbsp;  corresponding answer, avoiding unnecessary failover.&nbsp; Application<br>&nbsp;  designers SHOULD NOT modify the answer-routing principles described<br>&nbsp;

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The Diameter Base protocol provides an extensibility mechanism enabling<br>&nbsp;  a consistent way to define new Diameter applications, commands and attribute-<br>&nbsp;  value-pairs or modify existing ones.&nbsp; This document is a companion document to <br>&nbsp;  the Diameter Base protocol that further clarifies the rules to extend Diameter.<br>&nbsp;  This document is a guidelines document and therefore informative in nature.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The working group reached consensus on the document and the contents of the <br>&nbsp;  document was discussed in length.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp;  The document is a guideline document as such. Several topics discusses in the<br>&nbsp;  document originate from specification and implementation experience done<br>&nbsp;  outside IETF, specifically in 3GPP, when implementing and deploying new<br>&nbsp;  Diameter applications.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has received early reviews from the AAA-Doctors, OPS-DIR,<br>&nbsp;  SecDir and Gen-Art. The request for reviews was posted into dir-coord and<br>&nbsp;  aaa-doctors mailing lists. Received comments have been reflected.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Since the document does not define any MIBs, media types and such. Therefore,<br>&nbsp;  there is no need for MIB Doctor or Media Type and such expert reviews.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Jouni Korhonen (<a href="mailto:jouni.nospam@gmail.com">jouni.nospam@gmail.com</a>) is the document shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Benoit Claise (<a href="mailto:bclaise@cisco.com">bclaise@cisco.com</a>) is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The shepherd has reviewed earlier version than -21 of the document and<br>&nbsp;  diffs since then. The document is ready for publication and being forwarded<br>&nbsp;  to the IESG. Actually, the document has been in the working group since<br>&nbsp;  2007 and it is unlikely the technical contents would change/improve anymore.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has received an early review from AAA-Doctors, SecDir,<br>&nbsp;  Gen-ART and OPS-DIR. The reviews were requested through the<br>&nbsp;  dir-coord mailing list.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No issues/concerns identified. <br><br>&nbsp;  However, the document references to <a href="/doc/rfc4005/">RFC4005</a>. There is RFC4005bis<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dime-rfc4005bis/14/">draft-ietf-dime-rfc4005bis-14</a>) already in the IESG. Maybe the reference<br>&nbsp;  should be updated. If done so, Section 5.8 has to be re-evaluated since<br>&nbsp;  RFC4005bis removes the RADIUS-Diameter translation description.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. Each author have confirmed that are not aware of an IPR to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR declaration has been filed to this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; The working group has agreed on the contents of this document. There<br>&nbsp; are no controversial topics that would be results of&nbsp; "rough consensus".<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

The shepherd<br>&nbsp;  has received a verification from the document editor that they are fine<br>&nbsp;  'Are you ok to grant "BCP78 rights to the IETF Trust"' However, we have not<br>&nbsp;  received note from all past authors of the document.<br><br> -- Obsolete informational reference (is this intentional?): <a href="/doc/rfc2409/">RFC 2409</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (Obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc4306/">RFC 4306</a>)<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes, intentional.<br><br>&nbsp; -- Obsolete informational reference (is this intentional?): <a href="/doc/rfc3588/">RFC 3588</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (Obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc6733/">RFC 6733</a>)<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes, intentional.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the document is an Informational design guideline no formal review of the<br>&nbsp;  above is needed. They have already been done as a part of the document this<br>&nbsp;  document refers to.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. The document has only Informative references, since it is itself an<br>&nbsp;  informative document without any <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> language.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No normative references to documents in in-progress or unclear state documents.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not require actions by IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not require actions by IANA.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  Does not apply to this document, since it does not contain any of the above.</div></td>
