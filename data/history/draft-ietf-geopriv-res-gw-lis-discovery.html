This is worth mentioning not only because it might be helpful, but also because if the operator has populated the reverse tree for their private address space, the outer global address isn't going to refer to the customer.<br><br>Another point about global addresses versus NATted addresses at the CPE-PE edge is that protocols such as Dual-stack Light, Lightweight 4over6 and MAP will produce weird results for location determination and are only available on networks with native IPv6 capability, so LIS results obtained over IPv4 when these tunneling mechanisms are in use should be treated in a similar manner to LIS results obtained over a VPN connection.&nbsp;  It is _possible_ with lw4over6 and MAP (and maybe DS-Lite) to use the address+port range to specifically identify the customer endpoint, but given that it's much easier to do with IPv6, this seems pointless.&nbsp;  A similar issue exists for 6RD and other tunneled delivery of IPv6.<br><br>In 4.3, given that LIS discovery is a fairly infrequent operation, is there really any point in restricting the set of prefix masks at which LIS records can be placed?&nbsp;  It seems to me that the number of queries you'd get by starting at /64 and going one nybble at a time up the tree would be perfectly reasonable for an operation that happens infrequently. It would add latency if you are trying to locate a LIS as a prelude to making an emergency call, however.<br><br>Also, why bother looking up the IPv6 address? It seems to me that there is no chance that a LIS server is going to be configured on a per-IP-address basis, particularly since IPv6 addresses will not be allocated to end users. Are you attempting to account for the possibility that the provider might NAT the customer down to a single IPv6 address? If the purpose of this is to locate handsets on a mobile network, where the handset might well have been given a /128 by the provider, it might be worth mentioning that.<br><br>In 4.5, this whole mechanism is likely to fail for resolvers that implement <a href="/doc/rfc6303/">RFC 6303</a>.<br><br>In the last paragraph of 4.5, the outcome described seems bad enough to beg for mitigation.&nbsp;  Presumably in the scenario shown in figure 2, it's a bad outcome for the host to use STUN to get the public IP address corresponding to the outer edge of the NAT, and similarly a bad outcome for the CPE to query DNS A rather than DNS B.<br><br>The right way to solve this problem, presuming for the moment that the ISP cares about providing accurate LIS service, would be to publish a global IP address belonging to the ISP in the global DNS for the LIS corresponding to the ISP's external address pool.&nbsp;  This global IP address would however be configured on a host _inside the NAT_, and of course routing inside the NAT would have to reach that host without crossing the NAT, so that packets reach the LIS with the CPE's NATted IP address as the source address.&nbsp;  This can then be used to provide accurate location information, because the CPE's IP address can be directly associated with the customer.<br><br>This protocol relies heavily on STUN, but STUN server address discovery is problematic, and is not discussed.&nbsp;  In reading up on this, I've encountered several assertions that STUN works well with existing home gateways, but no document explaining how it works.&nbsp;  If your belief that STUN will address this problem is based on such documentation, a reference to it would be helpful.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>The type of RFC being requested is Informational. Informational is appropriate because this document specifies only recommendations for provisioning of discovery records in the DNS; it defines no new protocol. The title page header indicates that the document is to be Informational.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part<br>of home networking equipment. Discovering a Location Information<br>Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information<br>for location-based services. However, discovering a LIS when a<br>residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge,<br>requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented<br>by the gateway.<br><br>This document describes a solution to this problem. The solution<br>provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery<br>process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There is strong consensus around this document in the working group. It is required for the HELD protocol's discovery mechanism to work through NATs and other residential gateways.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are a few existing implementations of the protocol. It has been incorporated into several emerging standards, especially for emergency calling. The document received thorough review from the DNS community on its use of the reverse DNS.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The Document Shepherd is Alissa Cooper.<br>The responsible Area Director is Richard Barnes.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I have reviewed this document, and find it clear and ready for publication.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>I do not have concerns about the depth or breadth of review that has been performed.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The document defines a new way to use the reverse DNS tree (i.e., new records besides PTR), and an algorithm for searching the reverse DNS tree to find provisioned records. The document has been reviewed several times by members of the DNS community, on the GEOPRIV and DNSEXT mailing lists, and the comments raised have been resolved.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>I do not have any specific concerns.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that all relevent IPR disclosures have been filed.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been filed with regard to this document.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is strong consensus for this document. Several WG participants have expressed the opinion that it addresses a necessary use case.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>There are no threatened appeals.<br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>I have checked the document and did not find any ID nits.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>This document does not require any formal reviews.<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes. References are divided into normative and informative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>There are no such references.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no such references.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>This document does not make any request of IANA.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The document does not create any new IANA registries.<br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There is no formal language in this document.</div></td>
