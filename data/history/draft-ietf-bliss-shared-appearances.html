Instead: "User Agents that support the Shared Appearance feature use the dialog state package..." or even better: "The Shared Appearance feature uses the dialog state package...". There is no interoperability warning here; you're simply describing what the protocol does. Just as you don't ever say "MUST support SIP" (which would be silly), it is equally silly to say say that you "MUST support the dialog package stuff". If I could not sensibly choose to do otherwise, the MUST is not useful.<br><br>&nbsp;  When publishing or notifying dialog package information, a UA MUST<br>&nbsp;  include all dialog identification available at the time of<br>&nbsp;  publication, with the exception that a UA may omit information if it<br>&nbsp;  wishes to prevent other UAs from joining or picking up a call.<br><br>Again, you're not saying something about timing ("at the time of publication") or other interoperability concern. You're saying, "If you want to include dialog information, you MUST include dialog information." That's not a needed MUST. (Again, unless I'm missing something.) <br><br>&nbsp;  If the call is an emergency call, a UA MUST never wait for a<br>&nbsp;  confirmed seizure before sending an INVITE.&nbsp; Instead, the emergency<br>&nbsp;  call MUST proceed without waiting for the PUBLISH transaction.<br><br>&nbsp;  Otherwise, in the following cases, before sending the INVITE, a UA<br>&nbsp;  MUST send a dialog package PUBLISH request and wait for a 2xx<br>&nbsp;  response before proceeding:<br><br>I still don't really understand the MUST in the second paragraph. If you don't have to wait for the response to send the INVITE in the emergency case, what harm is there in not waiting in non-emergency cases?</div></td>

Is there some problem if I simply register, even if I'm not sure I'm going to be answering calls? Rather than the 2119 language (or in addition to if this is really trying to limit the potential for causing harm), an explanation of the potential downside is in order.</div></td>

Why<br>is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the<br>title page header?<br><br>The document is being requested as a Standard Track RFC.<br><br>The document updates <a href="/doc/rfc3261/">RFC3261</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc4235/">RFC4235</a> which mandates this<br>specification to be published as a Standard Track RFC.<br><br>The intent of the document(Standard Track) is indicated in the title<br>page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>Docment describes the requirements and implementations of a group<br>telephony feature which allows serveral user agents (UAs) to share a<br>common AoR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in the<br>group, and pick up join calls within the group.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>There were no points where consensus were rough but extending<br>pre-existing dialog event package rather than defining a new<br>event package was seen as a controversial issue for some. Also<br>to indicate whether a UA supports this specification, use of<br>option tag was suggested over the use of implicit mechanism<br>but WG decided to leave it as is as the server (appearance<br>agent) can gracefully handle the existance of non-compliant<br>UA.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>There are existing implementations as far as I know. Some<br>vendors have indicated their plan to implement the specification.<br>Review by Robert Sparks (responsible AD) and Dale Worley<br>have fine tuned the document by clarifying some unclarified<br>text along with some contoversial issues mentioned above.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Shida Schubert is the document shepherd and Robert Sparks<br>is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I have reviewed the document several times and the draft is in good<br>shape and I believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>The document has been reviewed extensively on the design team mailing<br>list, WG mailing list and post WGLC by AD and others, I believe that<br>sufficient reviews have been performed on the document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>Although this draft registers an XML schema with a new sub-namespace, the XML<br>schema defined is very simple and no need for expert review was<br>necessary as far as I am concerned as a document shepherd. The<br>reviewers who reviewed the document I believe had sufficient knowledge<br>to review the XML schema defined in the document.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No concern.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>Yes, there is an IPR statement filed against this document but<br>no discussions took place on the WG mailing list. The IPR statemnts<br>was filed by Verizon.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is a strong consensus by the WG.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>There are no ID nits.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal reviews are required.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>Normative reference for RFC3265bis and Alert-Info-URN are both still in<br>draft status but they both have either finished WGLC or are in the midst<br>of WGLC. Thus we can assume that these references will be ready by the<br>time this draft is to be published.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>None.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>They are in the title page, abstract and introduction.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The SIP Event Package Parameter, URN Sub-Namespace Registration,<br>XML Schema Registration and new SIP header parameter all are consistent<br>with the body of the document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>This document does not create new registry.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>The XML code in the document looks good. </div></td>
