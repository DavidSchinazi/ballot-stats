How does it handles when the GRASP layer is unable to send the messages in a timely fashion based on the API calls? Looking at GRASP I understand that it is using either UDP or TCP. The rate limiting of UDP does not appear to be more well specified that to follow <a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC 8085</a> recommendations. So my concern here is that you actually have some risk of running into that the upper layer using this API tries to become a bit to active and do everything at once, thus resulting in that TCP congestion control and flow control might block timely transmissions, and for UDP the rate limiter / congestion control of the UDP messages. What happens in this API when this occurs?</div></td>

 An ASA runs in an ACP node and therefore inherits all its security<br>&nbsp;  properties, i.e., message integrity, message confidentiality and the<br>&nbsp;  fact that unauthorized nodes cannot join the ACP.&nbsp; All ASAs within a<br><br>I agree with Roman's comment that the "it" whose security properties are<br>inhereited is the ACP *node*, not the ACP itself, and thus that some<br>rewording is appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp;  The GRASP API library would need to communicate with the GRASP core<br>&nbsp;  via an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism.&nbsp; The details of<br><br>Hmm, if the GRASP core is in kernel-space and the API library in<br>userspace, wouldn't we normally refer to that exchange as a system call<br>rather than IPC?&nbsp; (Figure 1 also labels this interaction "IPC".)<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Authorization of ASAs is not defined as part of GRASP and is not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supported.<br><br>Any chance I could interest you in s/not supported/a subject for future<br>work/?&nbsp; It is looking somewhat likely since such a statement is already<br>present in the security considerations...<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; User-supplied explicit locators for an objective are not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supported.&nbsp; The GRASP core will supply the locator, using the ACP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address of the node concerned.<br><br>This would seem to prevent any non-ACP use of GRASP; I suggest adding<br>some language with a caveat about "for example" or similar, unless the<br>intent is to limit the API usage to ACP (or DULL) scenarios.<br><br>Section 2.2.1<br><br>I think that the possibility for a single outbound message to get a<br>sequence of incoming replies (at different times) further complicates<br>the design of an asynchronous mechanism, and we would do well to discuss<br>how such scenarios (e.g., broadcast discovery messages) would be handled<br>by the implementation and API.&nbsp; (I see that we do end up using a timeout<br>in practice to resolve this topic, but would probably still mention it<br>as an issue that has been resolved, here.)<br><br>Section 2.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  ports rather than a separate port per session.&nbsp; Hence the GRASP<br>&nbsp;  design includes a session identifier.&nbsp; Thus, when necessary, a<br>&nbsp;  'session_nonce' parameter is used in the API to distinguish<br>&nbsp;  simultaneous GRASP sessions from each other, so that any number of<br>&nbsp;  sessions may proceed asynchronously in parallel.<br><br>I do see that there was previous discussion on the 'nonce' terminology<br>here, and I am unsure why there is need to move away from the "session<br>ID" terminology used in GRASP itself.&nbsp; In particular, the<br>"session_nonce" is not a number used *once*, rather, it is used only for<br>one session (but potentially multiple times within that session).&nbsp; That,<br>to me, makes it a (short-lived) identifier, not a nonce.&nbsp; Roman's<br>proposal of 'handle' would resolve this apparent disparity.<br><br>Section 2.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  On the first call in a new GRASP session, the API returns a<br>&nbsp;  'session_nonce' value based on the GRASP session identifier.&nbsp; This<br><br>What does "based on" mean?&nbsp; Does there need to be a one-to-one<br>correspondence?&nbsp; Or just in one direction?&nbsp; Are we going to be<br>constrained by the (IMO, too limited) 32 bits of randomness limit of the<br>GRASP Session ID?<br><br>Section 2.3.2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  -&nbsp; Note 3: In a language such as C the preferred implementation<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may be to represent the Boolean flags as bits in a single byte,<br><br>Which aspect(s) of C are relevant for the "such as"?<br><br>&nbsp;  An essential requirement for all language mappings and all<br>&nbsp;  implementations is that, regardless of what other options exist<br>&nbsp;  for a language-specific representation of the value, there is<br>&nbsp;  always an option to use a raw CBOR data item as the value.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  API will then wrap this with CBOR Tag 24 as an encoded CBOR data<br>&nbsp;  item [<a href="/doc/rfc7049/">RFC7049</a>] for transmission via GRASP, and unwrap it after<br>&nbsp;  reception.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand why the bstr wrapping is mandatory -- I would<br>have thought that the attraction of using a raw encoded CBOR data item<br>would be that it could be used directly, without additional wrapping.<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; is_fqdn (Boolean) - True if the locator is an FQDN<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; is_uri (Boolean) - True if the locator is a URI<br><br>Are these mutually exclusive?<br><br>Section 2.3.2.6<br><br>As for the GRASP session ID, I think that a 32-bit cap is too<br>restrictive.&nbsp; I think we should be in the habit of using 128-bit nonces<br>and needing to justify anything smaller.&nbsp; (64 bits would *probably* be<br>fine here, FWIW, and might make it easier to represent in common<br>language bindings.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 2.3.2.7).&nbsp; Another possible implementation is to hash the<br>&nbsp;  name of the ASA with a locally defined secret key.<br><br>I recognize that this is a throwaway line, but the naive keyed hash<br>construction is subject to length-extension attacks (for certain hash<br>constructions such as the Merkle-Damgarg family that includes SHA-2);<br>HMAC is more robust for this type of usage and can be phrased in an<br>similarly concise manner ("compute an HMAC of the name of the ASA under<br>a locally defined secret key").<br><br>Section 2.3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; deregister_asa()<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Note - the ASA name is strictly speaking redundant in this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  call, but is present for clarity.<br><br>So what happens if the wrong name is passed?<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Registration is not needed for "read-only" operations, i.e.,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the ASA only wants to receive synchronization or flooded data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  for the objective concerned.<br><br>These seem to have high overlap and thus be candidates for<br>deduplication.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; The 'ttl' parameter is the valid lifetime (time to live) in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  milliseconds of any discovery response for this objective.&nbsp; The<br><br>(nit?) I'd suggest to add "generated", since it would not apply to any<br>hypothetical received discovery response for the objective in question.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If the parameter 'overlap' is True, more than one ASA may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  register this objective in the same GRASP instance.<br><br>Do all ASAs registering this objective have to set it to True, or just<br>the first one, in order for the subsequent registrations to succeed?<br><br>Section 2.3.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; If the parameter 'minimum_TTL' is greater than zero, any<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  locally cached locators for the objective whose remaining time<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to live in milliseconds is less than or equal to 'minimum_TTL'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  are deleted first.&nbsp; Thus 'minimum_TTL' = 0 will flush all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  entries.<br><br>Why does one ASA's request flush entries from the cache shared with<br>other ASAs?&nbsp; I am forced to infer the motivation for including the<br>minimum_TTL parameter in the first place, but it seems like it is useful<br>if the requesting ASA needs to find something that will remain active<br>for a given period of time, but different ASAs may have different needs<br>for the peer's stability, and so flushing the cache in this way could<br>hamper the operation of peer ASAs.<br>If the intent is only to not return those cached locators *for this<br>discovery operation*, then say that, not that they are flushed from the<br>cache entirely.<br><br>Section 2.3.5<br><br>Thanks for the figure (I probably should have put one into <a href="/doc/rfc7546/">RFC 7546</a>,<br>which is basically this section but for the GSS-API).<br><br>I suggest noting in the first paragraph that the negotiation occurs in<br>lockstep, with the initiator starting the negotiation and preparing a<br>message, the responder processing that message and generating a new<br>negotiation message in turn, with at most one negotiation message in<br>flight at any given time.&nbsp; It seems particularly important to note<br>whether this also applies to negotiate_wait() calls/messages, or if<br>those can be made at any time by either entity.&nbsp; (This probably relates<br>to some of the genart reviewer's comments.)<br><br>I note that the prospect of the loop count going up (and, thus, risk of<br>infinite looping) was pointed out by the genart review.&nbsp; I share such<br>concerns and am happy to see that improved discussion of this topic (and<br>the related 'lifetime' extension) is planned.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  For this and any other error code, an exponential backoff is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  recommended before any retry.<br><br>Any guidance about whether this should be by doubling vs a different<br>exponent base?&nbsp; I guess the security considerations do say that it's<br>dependent on the semantics of the objective in question, which may be<br>enough (though a pointer or mention here would be appreciated).<br>(Also, any reason to not use the 2119 RECOMMENDED?)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; This function must be followed by calls to 'negotiate_step'<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and/or 'negotiate_wait' and/or 'end_negotiate' until the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  negotiation ends. 'listen_negotiate' may then be called again<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to await a new negotiation.<br><br>We just recommended a few paragraph previously that listen_negotiate()<br>should be called again *immediately* after the first listen_negotiate()<br>returns; I don't see why it's useful to also say that it might be called<br>again after a given negotiation ends.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Executes the next negotation step with the peer.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'objective' parameter contains the next value being proffered<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  by the ASA in this step.&nbsp; It must also contain the latest<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'loop_count' value received from request_negotiate() or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  negotiate_step().<br><br>This is intreseting; negotiate_step() must preserve the loop count from<br>the previous call, so only the initial negotiation response (the<br>request_negotiate() 'proffered_objective' output) can increase the loop<br>count, not any arbitrary negotiation step?&nbsp; That seems to limit concerns<br>about infinite looping (as raised by the genart reviewer and apparently<br>acknowledged in the response to the genart review).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  o&nbsp; Threaded implementation: Called in the same thread as the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; preceding 'request_negotiate' or 'listen_negotiate', with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same value of 'session_nonce'.<br><br>IIUC it is *expected* to be called in the same thread as the previous<br>call, but is not strictly speaking *required* to do so, since the<br>session_nonce tracks the library state for the negotiation in question.<br>Or am I mistaken?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'result' = True for accept (successful negotiation), False for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  decline (failed negotiation).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  'reason' = optional string describing reason for decline.<br><br>What happens if I pass a reason string with result of True?<br><br>Section 2.3.6<br><br>&nbsp;

 the detection of malicious denial of service attacks.<br><br>I suggest to drop the word "malicious"; such denial of service<br>conditions need not be malicious and can occur by accident.<br><br>&nbsp;  As a general precaution, all ASAs able to handle multiple negotiation<br>&nbsp;  or synchronization requests in parallel may protect themselves<br>&nbsp;  against a denial of service attack by limiting the number of requests<br>&nbsp;  they can handle simultaneously and silently discarding excess<br>&nbsp;  requests.<br><br>I think that best practices would also include some limit on the number<br>of objectives registered by a given ASA and possibly the number of ASAs<br>registered, to protect the core library/kernel resources.<br>(nit?)

That way, responses always have the same number of elements and possibly types irrespective of the function's outcome.<br><br>For a more extreme example, the response to "request_negotiate()" could have anywhere between one and four elements in it too, and of varying types.<br><br>It's possible this doesn't matter though; you're doing the API implementation, you get to decide and document it and then deal with user response.&nbsp; But as someone who produces and documents APIs a lot, this stuck out to me.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples<br>can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval<br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>or introduction.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document gives a conceptual outline of the API for the GRASP<br>&nbsp;  of ANIMA.&nbsp; It helps the Autonomic Service Agent (ASA) to call a GRASP <br>&nbsp;  module. It is not a formal specification for any particular <br>&nbsp;  programming language or operating system, and it is expected that <br>&nbsp;  details will be clarified in individual implementations.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example,<br>was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions<br>where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>&nbsp; This document was called <a href="/doc/draft-liu-anima-grasp-api/">draft-liu-anima-grasp-api</a><br>&nbsp; prior to its adoption. There was unanimous support for it in favor of <br>&nbsp; adoption and none against), so this document was adopted in December<br>&nbsp; 2017. There was interest in this work posts since its adoption. <br>&nbsp; There was never any opposition for this work.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; This document went through a relevant long document development<br>&nbsp; period (20 months for individual document period, 30 month for WG <br>&nbsp; document period). It has been reviewed well.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a <br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was<br>a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the <br>request posted? <br><br>&nbsp; This document went through multiple reviews by multiple WG<br>&nbsp; participants.&nbsp; There are at least two existing implementations. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Sheng Jiang is the document shepherd.<br>&nbsp; Robert Wilton is the responsible AD.<br>&nbsp; <br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication,<br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; I reviewed this document thorough once and had other minor comments from <br>&nbsp; time to time.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; The issues raised in my reviews were promptly addressed by authors<br>&nbsp; along with the comments from other ANIMA WG members.&nbsp; This document -06<br>&nbsp; version is ready for publication in my opinion.<br>&nbsp; <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of<br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader<br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or<br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with<br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware<br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the<br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event,<br>if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no outstanding issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have<br>already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. The authors, Brian Carpenter, Bing Liu, Wendong Wang and Xianyang<br>&nbsp; Gong have confirmed in writing that they are not aware of any IPR, and <br>&nbsp; that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance <br>&nbsp; with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.<br>&nbsp; <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br>&nbsp; <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the<br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br>WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There was broad support for this document. It was reviewed by active WG <br>&nbsp; participants. All changes were mostly minor.<br>&nbsp; <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?<br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br>&nbsp; <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See<br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; This document is now ID nits clean.<br>&nbsp; <br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such<br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; No MIB Doctor, media type, URI type or similar apply to this<br>&nbsp; document.<br>&nbsp; <br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state?
