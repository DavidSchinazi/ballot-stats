I did want to<br>reiterate one of his comments, regarding the potential for harmful<br>interaction between use of DoQ (or really, any encrypted DNS transport)<br>and captive portals.&nbsp; While this would accordingly have been best placed<br>in something generic to DNS privacy mechanisms, such as <a href="/doc/rfc9076/">RFC 9076</a> or <a href="/doc/rfc8932/">RFC<br>8932</a>, I think there might still be room to mention it here.&nbsp; I could<br>attempt to craft some text, if there is interest.<br><br>I made a pull request with some editorial suggestions at<br><a href="https://github.com/huitema/dnsoquic/pull/154">https://github.com/huitema/dnsoquic/pull/154</a><br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The specific non-goals of this document are:<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; No attempt to support server-initiated transactions, which are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  used only in DNS Stateful Operations (DSO) [<a href="/doc/rfc8490/">RFC8490</a>].<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8490/">RFC 8490</a> is a proposed standard, so excluding it maybe is a bit in<br>conflict with claiming that this is a "general-purpose transport for DNS",<br>absent some other argument that DSO is a special-purpose tool.<br><br>Section 5.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  DoQ connections MUST NOT use UDP port 53.&nbsp; This recommendation<br>&nbsp;  against use of port 53 for DoQ is to avoid confusion between DoQ and<br>&nbsp;  the use of DNS over UDP [<a href="/doc/rfc1035/">RFC1035</a>].<br><br>Just to clarify: this prohibition is intended to apply even if there would<br>otherwise be mutual agreement to use port 53?<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  DNS traffic follows a simple pattern in which the client sends a<br>&nbsp;  query, and the server provides one or more responses (multiple<br>&nbsp;  responses can occur in zone transfers).<br><br>Is this true even for DSO server-initiated transactions?<br><br>&nbsp;  The client MUST select the next available client-initiated<br>&nbsp;  bidirectional stream for each subsequent query on a QUIC connection,<br>&nbsp;  in conformance with the QUIC transport specification [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>].<br><br>Just to note: <a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC 9000</a> does not require the client to *use* the "next<br>available" stream, instead saying that "a stream ID that is used out of<br>order results in all streams of that type with lower- numbered stream IDs<br>also being opened".&nbsp; So this "MUST select the next available" is a new<br>requirement for DoQ, and it's not entirely clear to me that it's required<br>for interop (though it is more efficient than any alternatives).<br><br>Section 5.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  This has implications for proxying DoQ message to and from other<br>&nbsp;  transports.&nbsp; For example, proxies may have to manage the fact that<br>&nbsp;  DoQ can support a larger number of outstanding queries on a single<br>&nbsp;  connection than e.g., DNS over TCP because DoQ is not limited by the<br>&nbsp;  Message ID space.&nbsp; This issue already exists for DoH, where a Message<br>&nbsp;  ID of 0 is recommended.<br><br>I'm not sure how often this motivating text is relevant.&nbsp; The ID field<br>seems to be 16 bits, thus enabling 65k outstanding queries on a single<br>connection -- how often is there a need to have that many queries<br>outstanding at once?&nbsp; It looks like the motivation presented in <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC 8484</a><br>for setting the ID to zero is to improve caching, as otherwise queries<br>identical at the DNS level would be cached as separate requests by HTTP.<br>I agree, of course, that the ID field is redundant with the QUIC stream ID<br>and that it should be set to zero, I am just not sure if the number of<br>outstanding queries is a relevant motivation for doing so.<br><br>(It also looks like <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC 8484</a> refers to this value as the "DNS ID" rather than<br>"Message ID".&nbsp; I guess our options for consistent terminology are somewhat<br>limited, though.)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The following error codes are defined for use when abruptly<br>&nbsp;  terminating streams, aborting reading of streams, or immediately<br>&nbsp;  closing connections:<br><br>Should we say that these are what QUIC calls "application error code"s?<br>(Subsequent occurrences of the phrase "error code" might be modified to<br>"application error code" as well.)<br><br>Section 5.3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  set to DOQ_INTERNAL_ERROR.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is there any further guidance to give on when a DNS SERVFAIL response vs<br>QUIC RESET_STREAM is preferred (or is the guidance really always to issue<br>RESET_STREAM)?<br><br>Section 5.3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  It is noted that the restrictions on use of the above EDNS(0) options<br>&nbsp;  has implications for proxying message from TCP/DoT/DoH over DoQ.<br><br>Was it already rejeted to spend a sentence mentioning that such proxying<br>would involve translating the messages per the needs of the different<br>protocols on the different connections?<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Servers MUST NOT execute non replayable transactions received in<br>&nbsp;  0-RTT data.&nbsp; Servers MUST adopt one of the following behaviors:<br><br>I think we should clarify whether "execute" means "take any action in<br>response to" or just "send a response message for".&nbsp; (I think it needs to<br>be the former.)<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Implementations MUST protect against the traffic analysis attacks<br>&nbsp;  described in Section 9.5 by the judicious injection of padding.&nbsp; This<br><br>I think this is already overtaken by events, but a MUST-level requirement<br>seems overbearing here.&nbsp; My understanding is that providing complete<br>protection against these types of attack is still an open research<br>question....<br><br>&nbsp;  could be done either by padding individual DNS messages using the<br>&nbsp;  EDNS(0) Padding Option [<a href="/doc/rfc7830/">RFC7830</a>] or by padding QUIC packets (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 8.6 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>], the QUIC transport specification.<br><br>There is no Section 8.6 in <a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC 9000</a>.<br><br>Section 6.5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients that want to maintain long duration DoQ connections SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  use the idle timeout mechanisms defined in Section 10.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>],<br>&nbsp;  the QUIC transport specification.&nbsp; Clients and servers MUST NOT send<br>&nbsp;  the edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) Option [<a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC7828</a>] in any messages sent<br>&nbsp;  on a DoQ connection (because it is specific to the use of TCP/TLS as<br>&nbsp;  a transport).<br><br>Should we make some statement (analogous to what <a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC 7828</a> does) that if<br>such an option is received it MUST be ignored?&nbsp; In the absence of such<br>guidance I can imagine implementors feeling a need to enforce the "MUST<br>NOT send" on the receiving end.<br><br>Section 6.7<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc9103/">RFC9103</a>] specifies zone transfer over TLS (XoT) and includes updates<br>&nbsp;  to [<a href="/doc/rfc1995/">RFC1995</a>] (IXFR), [<a href="/doc/rfc5936/">RFC5936</a>] (AXFR) and [<a href="/doc/rfc7766/">RFC7766</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I note that there is currently no "Updates:" header to indicate this<br>relationship.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; DoQ implementations SHOULD<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; use the same QUIC connection for both AXFR and IXFR requests to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the same primary<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; pipeline such requests (if they pipeline XFR requests in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  general) and MAY intermingle them<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; send the response(s) for each request as soon as they are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  available i.e. responses MAY be sent intermingled<br><br>Given the "SHOULD use the same QUIC connection", what does MAY-level<br>guidance to "intermingle such requests" mean, in a QUIC context?&nbsp; Each DoQ<br>request is on a separate QUIC stream, so I do not see any opportunity for<br>intermingling other than by virtue of being in the same QUIC connection,<br>which is already a SHOULD.&nbsp; This is in contrast to a TCP or TLS situation,<br>where there is only a single data stream and intermingling has some<br>natural meaning (or meanings, for the response case specifically, where it<br>might apply to overall responses (composed of multiple response messages)<br>or individual response messages).<br><br>Section 8<br><br>The discussion in §6.5.2 about resource management could be security<br>relevant at times, if we wanted to backreference it.<br><br>&nbsp;  The security considerations of DoQ should be comparable to those of<br>&nbsp;  DoT [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>].&nbsp; DoT as specified in [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>] only addresses the stub<br><br>The security considerations section of <a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC 7858</a> includes a MUST-level<br>requirement to adhere to the recommendations of <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a>.&nbsp; Does such a<br>MUST-level requirement apply to DoQ as well?&nbsp; (I note that <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> is<br>currently listed as only an informative reference, which would need to<br>change if a MUST-level requirement was added.)<br><br>&nbsp;  to recursive resolver scenario, but the considerations about person-<br>&nbsp;  in-the-middle attacks, middleboxes and caching of data from clear<br>&nbsp;  text connections also apply for DoQ to the resolver to authoritative<br>&nbsp;

I did want to<br>reiterate one of his comments, regarding the potential for harmful<br>interaction between use of DoQ (or really, any encrypted DNS transport)<br>and captive portals.&nbsp; While this would accordingly have been best placed<br>in something generic to DNS privacy mechanisms, such as <a href="/doc/rfc9076/">RFC 9076</a> or <a href="/doc/rfc8932/">RFC<br>8932</a>, I think there might still be room to mention it here.&nbsp; I could<br>attempt to craft some text, if there is interest.<br><br>I made a pull request with some editorial suggestions at<br><a href="https://github.com/huitema/dnsoquic/pull/154">https://github.com/huitema/dnsoquic/pull/154</a><br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The specific non-goals of this document are:<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; No attempt to support server-initiated transactions, which are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  used only in DNS Stateful Operations (DSO) [<a href="/doc/rfc8490/">RFC8490</a>].<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8490/">RFC 8490</a> is a proposed standard, so excluding it maybe is a bit in<br>conflict with claiming that this is a "general-purpose transport for DNS",<br>absent some other argument that DSO is a special-purpose tool.<br><br>Section 5.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  DoQ connections MUST NOT use UDP port 53.&nbsp; This recommendation<br>&nbsp;  against use of port 53 for DoQ is to avoid confusion between DoQ and<br>&nbsp;  the use of DNS over UDP [<a href="/doc/rfc1035/">RFC1035</a>].<br><br>Just to clarify: this prohibition is intended to apply even if there would<br>otherwise be mutual agreement to use port 53?<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  DNS traffic follows a simple pattern in which the client sends a<br>&nbsp;  query, and the server provides one or more responses (multiple<br>&nbsp;  responses can occur in zone transfers).<br><br>Is this true even for DSO server-initiated transactions?<br><br>&nbsp;  The client MUST select the next available client-initiated<br>&nbsp;  bidirectional stream for each subsequent query on a QUIC connection,<br>&nbsp;  in conformance with the QUIC transport specification [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>].<br><br>Just to note: <a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC 9000</a> does not require the client to *use* the "next<br>available" stream, instead saying that "a stream ID that is used out of<br>order results in all streams of that type with lower- numbered stream IDs<br>also being opened".&nbsp; So this "MUST select the next available" is a new<br>requirement for DoQ, and it's not entirely clear to me that it's required<br>for interop (though it is more efficient than any alternatives).<br><br>Section 5.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  This has implications for proxying DoQ message to and from other<br>&nbsp;  transports.&nbsp; For example, proxies may have to manage the fact that<br>&nbsp;  DoQ can support a larger number of outstanding queries on a single<br>&nbsp;  connection than e.g., DNS over TCP because DoQ is not limited by the<br>&nbsp;  Message ID space.&nbsp; This issue already exists for DoH, where a Message<br>&nbsp;  ID of 0 is recommended.<br><br>I'm not sure how often this motivating text is relevant.&nbsp; The ID field<br>seems to be 16 bits, thus enabling 65k outstanding queries on a single<br>connection -- how often is there a need to have that many queries<br>outstanding at once?&nbsp; It looks like the motivation presented in <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC 8484</a><br>for setting the ID to zero is to improve caching, as otherwise queries<br>identical at the DNS level would be cached as separate requests by HTTP.<br>I agree, of course, that the ID field is redundant with the QUIC stream ID<br>and that it should be set to zero, I am just not sure if the number of<br>outstanding queries is a relevant motivation for doing so.<br><br>(It also looks like <a href="/doc/rfc8484/">RFC 8484</a> refers to this value as the "DNS ID" rather than<br>"Message ID".&nbsp; I guess our options for consistent terminology are somewhat<br>limited, though.)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The following error codes are defined for use when abruptly<br>&nbsp;  terminating streams, aborting reading of streams, or immediately<br>&nbsp;  closing connections:<br><br>Should we say that these are what QUIC calls "application error code"s?<br>(Subsequent occurrences of the phrase "error code" might be modified to<br>"application error code" as well.)<br><br>Section 5.3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  set to DOQ_INTERNAL_ERROR.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is there any further guidance to give on when a DNS SERVFAIL response vs<br>QUIC RESET_STREAM is preferred (or is the guidance really always to issue<br>RESET_STREAM)?<br><br>Section 5.3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  It is noted that the restrictions on use of the above EDNS(0) options<br>&nbsp;  has implications for proxying message from TCP/DoT/DoH over DoQ.<br><br>Was it already rejeted to spend a sentence mentioning that such proxying<br>would involve translating the messages per the needs of the different<br>protocols on the different connections?<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Servers MUST NOT execute non replayable transactions received in<br>&nbsp;  0-RTT data.&nbsp; Servers MUST adopt one of the following behaviors:<br><br>I think we should clarify whether "execute" means "take any action in<br>response to" or just "send a response message for".&nbsp; (I think it needs to<br>be the former.)<br><br>Section 6.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Implementations MUST protect against the traffic analysis attacks<br>&nbsp;  described in Section 9.5 by the judicious injection of padding.&nbsp; This<br><br>I think this is already overtaken by events, but a MUST-level requirement<br>seems overbearing here.&nbsp; My understanding is that providing complete<br>protection against these types of attack is still an open research<br>question....<br><br>&nbsp;  could be done either by padding individual DNS messages using the<br>&nbsp;  EDNS(0) Padding Option [<a href="/doc/rfc7830/">RFC7830</a>] or by padding QUIC packets (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 8.6 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>], the QUIC transport specification.<br><br>There is no Section 8.6 in <a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC 9000</a>.<br><br>Section 6.5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Clients that want to maintain long duration DoQ connections SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  use the idle timeout mechanisms defined in Section 10.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a>],<br>&nbsp;  the QUIC transport specification.&nbsp; Clients and servers MUST NOT send<br>&nbsp;  the edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) Option [<a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC7828</a>] in any messages sent<br>&nbsp;  on a DoQ connection (because it is specific to the use of TCP/TLS as<br>&nbsp;  a transport).<br><br>Should we make some statement (analogous to what <a href="/doc/rfc7828/">RFC 7828</a> does) that if<br>such an option is received it MUST be ignored?&nbsp; In the absence of such<br>guidance I can imagine implementors feeling a need to enforce the "MUST<br>NOT send" on the receiving end.<br><br>Section 6.7<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc9103/">RFC9103</a>] specifies zone transfer over TLS (XoT) and includes updates<br>&nbsp;  to [<a href="/doc/rfc1995/">RFC1995</a>] (IXFR), [<a href="/doc/rfc5936/">RFC5936</a>] (AXFR) and [<a href="/doc/rfc7766/">RFC7766</a>].&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I note that there is currently no "Updates:" header to indicate this<br>relationship.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; DoQ implementations SHOULD<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; use the same QUIC connection for both AXFR and IXFR requests to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the same primary<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; pipeline such requests (if they pipeline XFR requests in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  general) and MAY intermingle them<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; send the response(s) for each request as soon as they are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  available i.e. responses MAY be sent intermingled<br><br>Given the "SHOULD use the same QUIC connection", what does MAY-level<br>guidance to "intermingle such requests" mean, in a QUIC context?&nbsp; Each DoQ<br>request is on a separate QUIC stream, so I do not see any opportunity for<br>intermingling other than by virtue of being in the same QUIC connection,<br>which is already a SHOULD.&nbsp; This is in contrast to a TCP or TLS situation,<br>where there is only a single data stream and intermingling has some<br>natural meaning (or meanings, for the response case specifically, where it<br>might apply to overall responses (composed of multiple response messages)<br>or individual response messages).<br><br>Section 8<br><br>The discussion in §6.5.2 about resource management could be security<br>relevant at times, if we wanted to backreference it.<br><br>&nbsp;  The security considerations of DoQ should be comparable to those of<br>&nbsp;  DoT [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>].&nbsp; DoT as specified in [<a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>] only addresses the stub<br><br>The security considerations section of <a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC 7858</a> includes a MUST-level<br>requirement to adhere to the recommendations of <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a>.&nbsp; Does such a<br>MUST-level requirement apply to DoQ as well?&nbsp; (I note that <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> is<br>currently listed as only an informative reference, which would need to<br>change if a MUST-level requirement was added.)<br><br>&nbsp;  to recursive resolver scenario, but the considerations about person-<br>&nbsp;  in-the-middle attacks, middleboxes and caching of data from clear<br>&nbsp;  text connections also apply for DoQ to the resolver to authoritative<br>&nbsp;

It was very easy to read.<br><br>(4.3) says: <br><br>"Using QUIC might allow a protocol to disguise its purpose from devices on the network path using encryption and traffic analysis resistance techniques like padding. This specification does not include any measures that are designed to avoid such classification."<br><br>but then Sec 6.4 has a detailed, normative discussion of how to use padding to avoid classification. I suggest you delete or edit the bit in 4.3.<br><br>(5.3.1) Clients are allowed to send STOP_SENDING and servers are allowed to send RESET_STREAM. Servers sending STOP_SENDING break the connection. Given the prescriptiveness of these rules, it's odd that you don't address clients sending RESET_STREAM. IMO this should be allowed, but either way it should be specified.<br><br>(6.5.4) and (9.4) I hesitate to write this, as Christian is as well aware as anyone, but IMO QUIC address migration is not quite as privacy-destroying as this draft suggests. <a href="/doc/rfc9000/">RFC9000</a> has a number of normative requirements to reduce linkability, and work is ongoing to reduce it further. Granted, no anti-linkability mitigation is perfect, and if this is a primary goal of DoQ it's OK to discourage migration as you've done here.</div></td>

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard. The draft specifies the use of QUIC for transporting DNS exchanges between parties. The document specifies this status in its header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy for DNS.&nbsp; The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet loss recovery than UDP.&nbsp; DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in <a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There is consensus in the DPRIVE WG for publishing this specification. Additionally, valuable feedback was received from the QUIC WG as they were copied on the start of the WG Last Call.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document has undergone review from both DNS experts (implementors and operators) and QUIC experts. The feedback from the QUIC WG was valuable in identifying areas of the specification in need of additional detail.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Brian Haberman is the document shepherd. Éric Vyncke is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document shepherd reviewed both the WGLC version (-05) and the latest version (-07). The review entailed both a critical review of the specification for completeness as well as a review to determine if all WGLC comments were addressed. The current version (-07) does include text related to operating the protocol over UDP port 853, which is currently being reviewed for early allocation via IANA.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document was reviewed by members of the QUIC WG, which is broader perspective needed for this specification.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd does not have any concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The shepherd would categorize the consensus as being strong amongst the small (~10), but vocal, WG participants interested in the technology. The WG does have a history of raising concerns with work it sees as problematic and that type of resistance has not appeared with respect to this specification.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>- The 2119 boilerplate check in id-nits does not seem to recognize the use of <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> / <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>.<br>- The document contains a normative down-reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8094/">RFC 8094</a>. The reference can be moved to the Informative reference section as it is simply identifying the specification associated with UDP port 853.<br>- The document contains a normative down-reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a>. The WG is requesting a waiver for this down-ref as it is key to implementation guidance for the specification related to EDNS(0) padding.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>This document has a normative reference to draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8499bis. This document is actively being worked on in the DNSOP WG.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Yes. As noted earlier, the WG is requesting a down-ref waiver for <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a>. We could also, potentially, attempt to re-write the text related to <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a> to make it an Informative reference. Interested in guidance.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA Considerations section is complete and consistent with the body of the document. This document is making a request to associate UDP port 853 with DNS-over-QUIC. We are awaiting a response on an early allocation request for the port from IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The document creates a new registry entitled "DNS over QUIC Error Codes Registry", which is split into three ranges of assignment. One of those ranges is for provisional registrations and requires Expert Review. The goal of this range is to facilitate early experimentation/testing with the ability to transition the provisional value to a permanent one when a specification is published as an RFC. As a starting point, it is suggested that the document authors and the WG chairs be the initial set of expert reviewers.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard. The draft specifies the use of QUIC for transporting DNS exchanges between parties. The document specifies this status in its header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport privacy for DNS.&nbsp; The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to that provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet loss recovery than UDP.&nbsp; DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in <a href="/doc/rfc7858/">RFC7858</a>, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>There is consensus in the DPRIVE WG for publishing this specification. Additionally, valuable feedback was received from the QUIC WG as they were copied on the start of the WG Last Call.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document has undergone review from both DNS experts (implementors and operators) and QUIC experts. The feedback from the QUIC WG was valuable in identifying areas of the specification in need of additional detail.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Brian Haberman is the document shepherd. Éric Vyncke is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document shepherd reviewed both the WGLC version (-05) and the latest version (-07). The review entailed both a critical review of the specification for completeness as well as a review to determine if all WGLC comments were addressed. The current version (-07) does include text related to operating the protocol over UDP port 853, which is currently being reviewed for early allocation via IANA.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document was reviewed by members of the QUIC WG, which is broader perspective needed for this specification.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>The shepherd does not have any concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The shepherd would categorize the consensus as being strong amongst the small (~10), but vocal, WG participants interested in the technology. The WG does have a history of raising concerns with work it sees as problematic and that type of resistance has not appeared with respect to this specification.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>- The 2119 boilerplate check in id-nits does not seem to recognize the use of <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> / <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a>.<br>- The document contains a normative down-reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8094/">RFC 8094</a>. The reference can be moved to the Informative reference section as it is simply identifying the specification associated with UDP port 853.<br>- The document contains a normative down-reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a>. The WG is requesting a waiver for this down-ref as it is key to implementation guidance for the specification related to EDNS(0) padding.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>This document has a normative reference to draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8499bis. This document is actively being worked on in the DNSOP WG.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Yes. As noted earlier, the WG is requesting a down-ref waiver for <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a>. We could also, potentially, attempt to re-write the text related to <a href="/doc/rfc8467/">RFC 8467</a> to make it an Informative reference. Interested in guidance.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>The IANA Considerations section is complete and consistent with the body of the document. This document is making a request to associate UDP port 853 with DNS-over-QUIC. We are awaiting a response on an early allocation request for the port from IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>The document creates a new registry entitled "DNS over QUIC Error Codes Registry", which is split into three ranges of assignment. One of those ranges is for provisional registrations and requires Expert Review. The goal of this range is to facilitate early experimentation/testing with the ability to transition the provisional value to a permanent one when a specification is published as an RFC. As a starting point, it is suggested that the document authors and the WG chairs be the initial set of expert reviewers.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?
