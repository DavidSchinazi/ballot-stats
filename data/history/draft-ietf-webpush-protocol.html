I assume that some manageability considerations for HTTP may apply, but this is not mentioned. The protocol uses status codes which can be used for management purposes, but these are not exposed to users. Load implications are discussed in section 7, how to measure load impact is not described,&nbsp; it is probably assumed that HTTP load measurement applies.

If that could be done as an extension<br>later, then I'd be ok with that in terms of clearing the<br>discuss, but then I think you'd need to mention it, so<br>that applications and UAs don't build in an assumption<br>that these URLs are fixed for all time (while also<br>needing to be kept "secret" as with other bearer tokens).<br><br>(3) Why is it not correct to encourage mutual-auth TLS<br>for the application to push-service connections?&nbsp; I'm not<br>arguing to make that mandatory, but it's not that hard in<br>many cases and is very useful, esp since without some<br>client auth just knowing the URL will often enable a<br>sender to send a crap load of updates to possibly many<br>bandwidth/power-challenged UAs. (This is only a discuss<br>because of that potential DoS vector.)<br><br>(4) Is it really honest to say that the W3C Push API,<br>webpush encryption and vapid are only informative<br>references? The first seems easy to make normative, the<br>second I think really needs to exist before we ought<br>recommend this all get out into the wild and I'm not<br>clear if one could sensibly make a service for this<br>without the 3rd. Yes that might add some delay to the RFC<br>being issued, but that might be the right thing to do.<br>Why is it right to not wait on those two IDs and the w3c<br>rec?

I assume that some manageability considerations for HTTP may apply, but this is not mentioned. The protocol uses status codes which can be used for management purposes, but these are not exposed to users. Load implications are discussed in section 7, how to measure load impact is not described,&nbsp; it is probably assumed that HTTP load measurement applies. Securoty and privacy are discussed in a separate section.&nbsp; <br><br><br>A.3.&nbsp; Documentation<br><br>&nbsp;  Is an operational considerations and/or manageability section part of<br>&nbsp;  the document?<br><br>DR - Operational considerations are described in Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  Does the proposed protocol have a significant operational impact on<br>&nbsp;  the Internet?<br><br>DR - it may have, maybe not on the Internet as a whole, but certainly in networks where this is deployed. <br><br>&nbsp;  Is there proof of implementation and/or operational experience?<br><br>DR - not in the document, yes in the industry</div></td>

Summary<br> <br>The document shepherd is Shida Schubert. The responsible Area Director is Alissa Cooper.<br> <br>This document defines simple protocol for the delivery of real-time events to user agents (web browsers etc.), using HTTP/2 server push. The working group is quite sure that this will be a useful Standards Track extension.<br> <br>2. Review and Consensus<br> <br>The document has progressed and iterated very rapidly on github and through discussion on the mailing list since its inception in June of 2015 and has gone through two WGLCs and this version has had a rough consensus of the WG. <br> <br>Many of the contributors are those from major browser vendors (Google, Microsoft, Mozilla) but many from service provider and server software manufacturers have been contributing to stabilize the specification as well. This specification has been implemented and deployed in part and some deviation of this specification has been deployed for some time in production environment supporting the Tao of IETF both in rough consensus and a running code. <br> <br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br> <br>- Proposed Standard<br>- The title page header indicates that it is a standard-track.<br> <br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br> <br>This document defines a protocol which enables application server upon having consensus from the user agent (a subscription) to push an event-driven message called a push message (receipt of a call, a notification from a bank to authorize a transaction) through an intermediate service called push service that manages the subscription state and delivery of the push message. <br> <br> <br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br> <br>The document shepherd has read the draft and is confident that this document is ready for publication. <br> <br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br> <br>No. <br> <br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br> <br>We had contributors heavily involved in the development of HTTP2 (which the specification depends on) to reviewing and actively contributing to the draft. <br> <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br> <br>None.<br> <br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br> <br>Irrelevant as no IPR disclosures have been filed.<br> <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br> <br>The WG as a whole understand and agree with the current standing of specification. <br> <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summaries the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br> <br>We had one individual expressed discontent as the main driver/contributors of the draft are from major browser vendors. The same individual had some issue with lack of use-case specific feature (having the ability to send broadcast style push messages) built into the protocol. As the shepherd of this document, as enough contributors from non-major browser vendors and potential users of the protocol were involved and were content with the document, I believe one individual's discontent should not defer the progress of the document. As for the lack of feature to support particular use-case this individual had raised, the specification is able to support such use-cases without any protocol mechanism, I see no reason to bloat the specification without a consensus to add such feature. <br> <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br> <br> <br>== Missing Reference: 'RFCthis' is mentioned on line 1217, but not defined<br> <br>RFCthis will be replaced with the RFC number of this specification once it's approved.<br> <br>-- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. 'CAP-URI'<br> <br>This is not a downref.<br> <br>** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC 2818</a><br> <br><a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a> is the specification which defines HTTPS which this specification normatively depends on (non-HTTPS allowed), so this again is not a downref.<br> <br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br> <br>N/A<br> <br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br> <br>YES<br> <br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br> <br>No problem here. <br> <br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br> <br>Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a> which defines HTTPS (HTTP over TLS).<br> <br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br> <br>No. <br> <br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br> <br>All the extensions defined in the draft are listed and specified in IANA consideration sections. <br> <br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br> <br>Not relevant. The web push identifiers registration creates a sub-namespaces which follows the guidance of <a href="/doc/rfc3553/">RFC3553</a> (requiring IETF consensus).</div></td>
