[...]<br><br>(nit) The wording here ("its privacy analysis") suggests that the<br>referenced document is an authoritative/official IETF position, but it<br>seems to be a blog post by a single individual.&nbsp; Using "one" or "a"<br>rather than "its" would convey a less-authoritative connotation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In both cases, the IP address<br>&nbsp;  originating queries to the authoritative server is as sensitive as it<br>&nbsp;  is for HTTP [sidn-entrada].<br><br>I don't see how [sidn-entrada] supports the claim that end-user-adjacent<br>DNS client IP addresses are equally sensitive as HTTP client IP<br>Addresses; it mentions "sensitive" only twice (as "privacy-sensitive",<br>admittedly, applying to such IP addresses, but as an assertion without<br>justification) and "http" only in URLs (mostly in the references) and as<br>an example request.&nbsp; It would feel more natural to use an IETF reference<br>here, as well -- e.g., <a href="/doc/rfc7624/">RFC 7624</a> discusses correlating client IP<br>addresses with end users, <a href="/doc/rfc7239/">RFC 7239</a> clearly covers privacy considerations<br>for sending client IP addresses in the "forwarded" header field, and<br>there are no doubt others -- though I do note the contents of the<br>paragraph after this one.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  However, for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, it is<br>&nbsp;  important to note that source addresses are propagated with queries<br>&nbsp;  and comprise metadata about the host, user, or application that<br>&nbsp;  originated them.<br><br>(This "propagated with queries" is still contingent on EDNS(0) Client<br>Subnet from the previous paragraph, right?)<br><br>Section 4.2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  cache poisoning attacks by off-path attackers.&nbsp; It is noted, however,<br>&nbsp;  that they are designed to just verify IP addresses (and should change<br>&nbsp;  once a client's IP address changes), they are not designed to<br>&nbsp;  actively track users (like HTTP cookies).<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  not be.&nbsp; When other protocols will become more and more privacy-aware<br>&nbsp;  and secured against surveillance (e.g., [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>],<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/">I-D.ietf-quic-transport</a>]), the use of unencrypted transports for DNS<br>&nbsp;  may become "the weakest link" in privacy.&nbsp; It is noted that at the<br>&nbsp;  time of writing there is on-going work attempting to encrypt the SNI<br>&nbsp;  in the TLS handshake [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption/">I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption</a>].<br><br>This mention of encrypted "SNI" (now encrypted ClientHello) comes as a<br>bit of a non sequitur.&nbsp; I suggest a bit of transition such as an<br>additional clause at the end of the sentences ", which is one of the<br>last remaning non-DNS cleartext identifiers of a connection target".<br>(While the actual work itself has progressed to encrypting the entire<br>ClientHello, I think it's okay to focus the exposition here on the SNI,<br>as the relevant attribute.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It can be noted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that if the user selects a single resolver with a small client<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; population (even when using an encrypted transport) it can<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; actually serve to aid tracking of that user as they move across<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network environment.<br><br>I wonder if it is worth adding another clause at the end: ", and that an<br>attacker in a position to observe the moving user is likely also able to<br>observe the likely-unencrypted DNS queries from the resolver to the<br>authoritative servers"<br>Also, nit: "environments" plural.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Traffic analysis of unpadded encrypted traffic is also possible<br>&nbsp;  [pitfalls-of-dns-encryption] because the sizes and timing of<br>&nbsp;  encrypted DNS requests and responses can be correlated to unencrypted<br>&nbsp;  DNS requests upstream of a recursive resolver.<br><br>We could (but don't have to) note that effective padding policies remain<br>an open area of research.<br><br>Section 6.1.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  o communicate clearly the change in default to users<br><br>I think this is intending to say "when the default application resolver<br>changes away from the system resolver", but the present text is perhaps<br>a little unclear about what "the change" is referring to.<br><br>Section 6.1.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if<br>&nbsp;  encrypted DNS such as DoH or DoT is used, unless the client has been<br>&nbsp;  configured in a secure way with the server identity, an active<br>&nbsp;  attacker can impersonate the server.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>More than the server identity is needed -- the credentials or trust<br>anchor needed to authenticate a peer as that identity are also needed.<br><br>Section 6.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  User privacy can also be at risk if there is blocking (by local<br>&nbsp;  network operators or more general mechanisms) of access to remote<br>&nbsp;  recursive servers that offer encrypted transports when the local<br>&nbsp;  resolver does not offer encryption and/or has very poor privacy<br>&nbsp;  policies.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I suggest adding "e.g." before "when the local resolver" to avoid giving<br>the impression that this is an exhaustive list.<br><br>&nbsp;  This is a form of Rendezvous-Based Blocking as described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 4.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7754/">RFC7754</a>].&nbsp; Such blocklists often include servers know<br>&nbsp;  to be used for malware, bots or other security risks.&nbsp; In order to<br>&nbsp;  prevent circumvention of their blocking policies, some networks also<br>&nbsp;  block access to resolvers with incompatible policies.<br><br>Perhaps this is touching too much on the controversial topic, but it<br>seems to me that the networks in question "attempt to block access";<br>whether or not they fully and reliably succeed at doing so is not clear.<br>(See also the near-impossibility of closing covert channels in<br>protocols.)<br><br>&nbsp;  It is also noted that attacks on remote resolver services, e.g., DDoS<br>&nbsp;  could force users to switch to other services that do not offer<br>&nbsp;  encrypted transports for DNS.<br><br>nit: comma after DDoS.<br><br>Section 6.1.4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Some implementations have, in fact, chosen to restrict the use of the<br>&nbsp;  'User-Agent' header so that resolver operators cannot identify the<br>&nbsp;  specific application that is originating the DNS queries.<br><br>With similar disclaimer as previously, perhaps "trivially identify"?<br>There are other fingerprinting techniques possible even at, e.g., the TLS<br>layer (that we discussed previously in this document!), which still<br>apply to DoH.<br><br>Section 6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This "protection", when using a large resolver with many clients, is<br>&nbsp;  no longer present if ECS [<a href="/doc/rfc7871/">RFC7871</a>] is used because, in this case, the<br>&nbsp;  authoritative name server sees the original IP address (or prefix,<br>&nbsp;  depending on the setup).<br><br>(side note) this has always been a bit confusing to me -- ECS is "client<br>subnet", not "client address", and I don't really understand why someone<br>would set the prefix length to the full 128 (or 32) bits of the address.<br>Is there really a lot of non-truncated client addresses being sent<br>around like this?&nbsp; How did that happen?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So,<br>&nbsp;  requests to a given ccTLD may go to servers managed by organizations<br>&nbsp;  outside of the ccTLD's country.&nbsp; End users may not anticipate that,<br>&nbsp;  when doing a security analysis.<br><br>(Is this a "for example"?&nbsp; It seems plausibly relevant for non-cc TLDs<br>as well.)<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The IAB privacy and security program also have a work in progress<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc7624/">RFC7624</a>] that considers such inference-based attacks in a more<br>&nbsp;  general framework.<br><br>I do not really think the final RFC constitutes a "work in progress"<br>anymore.<br><br>Section 8<br><br>&nbsp;  Passive DNS systems [passive-dns] allow reconstruction of the data of<br>&nbsp;  sometimes an entire zone.&nbsp; They are used for many reasons -- some<br>&nbsp;  good, some bad.&nbsp; Well-known passive DNS systems keep only the DNS<br>&nbsp;  responses, and not the source IP address of the client, precisely for<br>&nbsp;  privacy reasons.&nbsp; Other passive DNS systems may not be so careful.<br><br>Perhaps not so well-intentioned, either...<br><br>&nbsp;  The revelations from the Edward Snowden documents, which were leaked<br>&nbsp;  from the National Security Agency (NSA) provide evidence of the use<br><br>nit: comma after "(NSA)".<br><br>Section 9<br><br>&nbsp;  To our knowledge, there are no specific privacy laws for DNS data, in<br>&nbsp;  any country.&nbsp; Interpreting general privacy laws like<br>&nbsp;  [data-protection-directive] or GDPR [10] applicable in the European<br>&nbsp;  Union in the context of DNS traffic data is not an easy task, and we<br>&nbsp;  do not know a court precedent here.&nbsp; See an interesting analysis in<br>&nbsp;  [sidn-entrada].<br><br>This text is essentially unchanged since <a href="/doc/rfc7626/">RFC 7626</a>;

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>This document is intended as an Informational RFC. Informational is indicated in the title page header. The document describes a series of potential privacy issues that should be considered by operators, developers, and users of the DNS. The document does not describe protocol operations or recommendations for operating or using the DNS. As such, Informational is the proper type.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the privacy issues associated with the use of<br>&nbsp;  the DNS by Internet users.&nbsp; It is intended to be an analysis of the<br>&nbsp;  present situation and does not prescribe solutions.&nbsp; This document<br>&nbsp;  obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc7626/">RFC 7626</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>As privacy aspects differ between readers, there was significant discussions over what issues warranted mention in the document, especially as a -bis document. The resulting content represents the key aspects that the WG felt was important to document on privacy matters related to DNS.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>This document received a number of reviews from a variety of stakeholder communities. The shepherd considers the document solid and worthy of publication.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Brian Haberman<br>Who is the Responsible Area Director? Éric Vyncke<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document shepherd performed two types of reviews of the document. The first review focused on the process-related aspects of publishing<br>an RFC, including the existence of any nits. The document is structured accordingly for an Informational document. The document does contain<br>references to two drafts that have been revised since the publication of this version of the draft. Those references will be rectified<br>when an updated version of this draft is published.<br><br>The second review performed on the document focused on assessing that all comments and issues raised during the WG process were addressed.<br>The shepherd reviewed all comments made during the WGLC as well as comments raised on the mailing list during development of the draft.<br>The shepherd is comfortable that the authors addressed all issues raised within the WG.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>As this is a revision of an existing RFC focused on privacy issues, it would be beneficial to have someone with an in-depth knowledge<br>of privacy issues to review the document before/during IETF Last Call.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There is strong consensus within the WG for the contents of this document. A vocal minority have voiced issues with parts of the document that potentially relate to possible work<br>within the proposed ADD/ABCD working group. The shepherd believes that this document captures the current privacy issues related to DNS.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>As noted in (3), this document references two drafts that have newer versions published since the publication of this draft.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc7626/">RFC 7626</a>. The header correctly identifies that action as does the Abstract. That information is not in the Introduction.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A.<br><br></div></td>
