Or does it include MLD as well ?

From a<br>brief examination of the relevant IGMP messages, it seems that the EVPN<br>messages might actually contain information to populate literally all<br>the IGMP fields, but this is probably worth mentioning explicitly.&nbsp; In<br>particular, guidance might be interesting for (e.g.) IGMPv3, that lets<br>multiple Group Records be included in a single Membership Report.<br>(Pedantically, such IGMPv3 multiplexing might also require phrasing<br>changes for the reverse process, taking IGMP and constructing EVPN<br>routes, since we refer to (e.g) "the Group address of the IGMP<br>Membership Report" in places, and that is not a well-defined concept in<br>the absence of some text indicating group-by-group processing.)<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;

From a<br>brief examination of the relevant IGMP messages, it seems that the EVPN<br>messages might actually contain information to populate literally all<br>the IGMP fields, but this is probably worth mentioning explicitly.&nbsp; In<br>particular, guidance might be interesting for (e.g.) IGMPv3, that lets<br>multiple Group Records be included in a single Membership Report.<br>(Pedantically, such IGMPv3 multiplexing might also require phrasing<br>changes for the reverse process, taking IGMP and constructing EVPN<br>routes, since we refer to (e.g) "the Group address of the IGMP<br>Membership Report" in places, and that is not a well-defined concept in<br>the absence of some text indicating group-by-group processing.)<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;
