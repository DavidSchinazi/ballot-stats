I'm<br>happy to let the INT or OPSEC folks say this however they<br>like but as stated this seems overly broad.<br><br>- 2.1 - is it really wise to recommend blocking v6 at layer<br>2? Would that not possibly get hard to turn off when you do<br>want v6 packets? Seems fragile to me fwiw. I know you don't<br>strongly recommend that but for things like this where you<br>point at something it'd be better if you also called out any<br>significant downsides.</div></td>
