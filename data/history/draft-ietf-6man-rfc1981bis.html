I believe there is an editing nit in section 5.4 now:<br>"Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response<br>&nbsp;  to a notification that the Path MTU was decreased, but only for the<br>&nbsp;  specific connection specified by the Packet Too Big message, but only<br>&nbsp;  based on the message and connection. "<br>Is it on purpose to have twice "but only" here?<br><br>I leave my previous comments&nbsp; below for the record. I don't think all of them have been addressed but I aldo don't recognize any further discussion about those points:<br><br>1) I agree with Ekr on this sentence:<br>"Nodes SHOULD appropriately validate the payload of ICMPv6 PTB<br>&nbsp;  messages to ensure these are received in response to transmitted<br>&nbsp;  traffic (i.e., a reported error condition that corresponds to an IPv6<br>&nbsp;  packet actually sent by the application) per [ICMPv6]."<br>This sounds like it should be a MUST but I guess it depends on the upper layer protocol if such a validation is possible or not, e.g. if information are available that can be used for validation. Maybe you can be more explicit here and even say something like pmtu discovery should/must only be used if the upper layer protocol provides means for validation of the icmp payload (like a sequence number in TCP)…?<br><br>Further also note that if the upper layer does the validation while the IP layer maintains EMTU_S, there must be an interface from the upper layer to the IP layer to tell if a packet is valid or not before the IP layer updates the MTU estimate. This seems actually more complicated than this one sentences indicates.<br><br>2) Also as Ekr says, I also have problems to fully understand this normative text in section 4:<br>"After receiving a Packet Too Big message, a node MUST attempt to<br>&nbsp;  avoid eliciting more such messages in the near future.&nbsp; The node MUST<br>&nbsp;  reduce the size of the packets it is sending along the path.&nbsp; Using a<br>&nbsp;  PMTU estimate larger than the IPv6 minimum link MTU may continue to<br>&nbsp;  elicit Packet Too Big messages.&nbsp; Since each of these messages (and<br>&nbsp;  the dropped packets they respond to) consume network resources, the<br>&nbsp;  node MUST force the Path MTU Discovery process to end.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nodes using Path MTU Discovery MUST detect decreases in PMTU as fast<br>&nbsp;  as possible."<br>I especially don't understand the first part, given that a PTB message may still indicate a MTU that is larger than the minimum link MTU which then may cause another PTB message later on the path. This text reads like if you receive one PTB message you should better end discovery and fall back to the minimum link MTU to avoid any further PTB message and not waist any resources. I don't think that's the intention and as such I don't understand when it is recommended to end discovery here...?<br><br>3) Section 5.2 seems to be written with only single homed hosts in mind. It might be good to advise that the pmtu information should always be stored on a per interface basis...?<br><br>4) Also section 5.2:<br>You only advise to store information per flow ID, however, if the flow label is not used, wouldn't it make really sense to just use the 5-tuple instead? Also note that EMCP is often done based on the 5-tuple or even 6-tuple (with the ToS field).<br><br>5) And more in section 5.2:<br>"When a Packet Too Big message is received, the node determines which<br>&nbsp;  path the message applies to based on the contents of the Packet Too<br>&nbsp;  Big message. "<br>MAYBE:<br>"When a valid Packet Too Big message is received, the node determines which<br>&nbsp;  path the message applies to based on the contents of the Packet Too<br>&nbsp;  Big message."<br>And further on:<br>"If the tentative PMTU is less than the existing PMTU estimate, the<br>&nbsp;  tentative PMTU replaces the existing PMTU as the PMTU value for the<br>&nbsp;  path."<br>This doesn't cover the case where a pmtu probe with a larger size was send and the PTB message returns a larger value then stored. Maybe state this explicitly.<br><br>This applies similar to this sentence in section 6:<br>OLD<br>"A node, however, should never raise its estimate of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PMTU based on a Packet Too Big message, so should not be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vulnerable to this attack.“<br>NEW<br>"A node, however, MUST NOT raise its estimate of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PMTU based on a Packet Too Big message that is not a (validated) response to a PMTU probe that was previously send by this node, so should not be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vulnerable to this attack."<br><br>6) Further section 5.2:<br>Should this statement be maybe upper case MUST:<br>"The packetization layers must be notified about decreases in the PMTU. "<br><br>7) Technical comment on section 5.3 in general:<br>There is a difference between aging if a flow is active or not. While I maybe don't want to probe again for this connection because my application already decided to use a mode where it can live with the current pmtu and it's too much effect to switch, I really want to probe at the beginning of the next connection again to check if I can use a different mode now. While the IP layer does not have a notion of connection it can observe if packets are frequently send with the same 5-tuple and reset the cached pmtu after a certain idle time.<br><br>8) Section 5.4: should this maybe be normative, at least the last MUST NOT (be fragmented):<br>"A packetization layer (e.g., TCP) must track the PMTU for the path(s)<br>&nbsp;  in use by a connection; it should not send segments that would result<br>&nbsp;  in packets larger than the PMTU, except to probe during PMTU<br>&nbsp;  discovery (this probe packet must not be fragmented to the PMTU). "<br><br><br>Nit:<br>The abbreviation PTB is only used once in section 4 (and never expanded).</div></td>

Perhaps s/such/ICMPv6/ (or PTB).<br><br>2: Sec 3: "Upon receipt of such a message, the<br>&nbsp;  source node reduces its assumed PMTU for the path based on the MTU of<br>&nbsp;  the constricting hop as reported in the Packet Too Big message" -- this says that it reduces it *for the path*. But (as somewhat alluded to later in the draft) the nodes doesn't know what the path *is* -- it can decrease for the destination, or flow, or even interface, but (unless it is strict source routing) it doesn't control or really know the path (see also #4)<br><br>3: Sec 4: "The recommended setting for this timer is twice its minimum value (10 minutes)." - as above. This was from 1996 - were these metrics discussed at all during the -bis? I suspect that the average flow is much shorter these days (more web traffic, fatter pipes, etc) and so a flow of 10 minutes seems really long (to me at least). <br><br>4: Sec 5.2: "The packetization layers must be notified about decreases in the<br>&nbsp;  PMTU.&nbsp; Any packetization layer instance (for example, a TCP<br>&nbsp;  connection) that is actively using the path must be notified if the<br>&nbsp;  PMTU estimate is decreased.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: even if the Packet Too Big message contains an Original<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Packet Header that refers to a UDP packet, the TCP layer must be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; notified if any of its connections use the given path."<br> - this is related to #2 -- I don't know *which* path my packets take - once I launch them into the void, they may be routed purely based upon destination IP address, or they may be hashed based upon some set of header fields to a particular ECMP link or LSP. Once packets hit a load balancer, it is probably even *likely* that the UDP and TCP packets end up on different things. So, if I get a PTB from a router somewhere, I can probably guess that other packets to the same destination address will also follow that path, but I cannot know that for sure. I'm fine to decrease MTU towards that destination IP, but is that what this is suggesting? If so, please say that. If not, please let me know what I should do. The above is even more tricky / fun when I'm using flow id as the flow identifier -- if I get a PTB for flow 0x1234, what do I do? <br><br> 5: Sec 5.3: "Once a minute, a timer-driven procedure runs through all cached PMTU values, and for each PMTU whose timestamp is not "reserved" and is older than the timeout interval ...". Please consider providing clarifications here. The wording implies that I should set a timer to fire on the minute, and trigger the behavior. If all of the (NTP synced!) machines in my datacenter do this, and all try send bigger packets (on 1/10th of long flows) their first hop router will get many, many over-sized packets and it will severely rate-limit the PTBs. <br><br><br>Nits (Some of these are purely academic.)<br>I understand that you are trying to limit the changes, so feel free to ignore these:<br><br>1: "A node sending packets much smaller than the Path<br>MTU allows is wasting network resources and probably getting<br>suboptimal throughput." - the "much" confuses me. If I'm using anything less than the MTU I'm wasting network resources and getting suboptimal throughput - I might not care, but if (used MTU) &lt; (path MTU) I'm wasting resources.<br><br>2: "Nodes implementing Path MTU Discovery and sending packets larger than<br>the IPv6 minimum link MTU are susceptible to problematic connectivity<br>if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted." The "implementing Path MTU Discovery and" seems redundant. ALL nodes sending packets larger than minimum MTU are "susceptible to problematic connectivity if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted.". I get what you are trying to say, but my OCD tendencies would not allow me to ignore this... <br><br>3: "In the case of multipath routing (e.g., Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP),"- this is vague / confusing -- (Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP) makes it sound like either ECMP is an acronym for Equal Cost Multipath Routing, or that ECMP is something different to Equal Cost Multipath Routing.<br>I'd suggest just dropping the "ECMP" (or, "Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing", but that seems clumsy)</div></td>

I understand the desire to only deal with the changed parts of the specification; but the current process as I understand it is that bis versions of document are expected to be "brought up to code" according to modern IETF document practices. Perhaps we should have a conversation about whether that practice is in need of revising, but I'm not sure making piecemeal exceptions is the best way to go about starting that conversation. In any case, I believe that current practice is that new RFCs cite 2119 and adhere to its definitions when using these specific terms in all-caps; and that this will be published as a new RFC.<br><br>Minor technical comment: Like others, I also had a really hard time with the paragraph in section 4 concluding with "MUST force the Path MTU Discovery process to end." It's difficult to read this as anything *other* than "you get one Path Too Big, and just shut down discovery," but that's clearly not what the rest of the document says. (I'll also note that if we are treating capital "MUST" as normative, then "MUST attempt to" is kind of meaningless).<br><br>Minor technical comment: Section 5.4 has three paragraphs, starting "Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response to a notification" that propose a more aggressive means of dealing with packets lost to PMTU issues; most of this text is a warning about how this can go awry and (if you'll excuse a bit of hyperbole) melt the Internet. Given that the first alternative works just fine and appears to be much safer, is this alternative actually something we want to recommend for today's implementations?<br><br>The remainder of my comments are editorial.<br><br>The second-to-last paragraph of the introduction uses the phrase "such messages" in a way that makes the antecedant difficult to find. I spent a while trying to figure out how PMTUD used TCP three-way-handshakes or blackholed TCP packets to determine PMTU. Suggest: "..relies on ICMPv6 messages to determine..."<br><br>The abbreviation "PTB" appears in the second paragraph of section 4. I would ordinarily suggest expanding on first use; but as this is this first and only use, I suggest simply replacing it with the long form used in the rest of the document.<br><br>Section 5.1 introduces the term MMS_S, and relates it to EMTU_S. I note that the former is not in the terminology section, while the latter is -- I suspect that they should both be present.<br><br>Section 5.2 uses the acronym "ECMP". I would suggest citing the related document in which ECMP is defined and optionally expanding the acronym.<br><br>Section 5.2 indicates:<br><br>&nbsp;  Also, the instance that sent the packet that elicited the Packet Too<br>&nbsp;  Big message should be notified that its packet has been dropped, even<br>&nbsp;  if the PMTU estimate has not changed, so that it may retransmit the<br>&nbsp;  dropped data.<br><br>It is quite nonintuitive how this situation could arise: if the packet is of size X, and the PMTU has not changed, then it follows that X &lt;= PMTU (as the packet would have been reduced in size otherwise). If the PMTU has not changed, it also follows that PMTU &lt;= MTU (from the Packet Too Big message). it follows that X &lt;= MTU (from the Packet Too Big message), and so it really should not have been dropped unless the corresponding router has an implementation flaw of some kind. More importantly, it would seem that an attempt to transmit another packet of size X at this point would run an overwhelmingly high chance of triggering another Packet Too Big for whatever errant reason caused the first one to be sent.<br><br>I'm sure this naïve explanation overlooks whatever nonintuitive situation is envisioned by this paragraph. It would be quite helpful if such a situation were described: I, as an implementor, would look at this and say "What? No. I'm not doing that. It's extra work for no benefit."<br><br>I suspect it will be dealt with by the RFC editor, but the first normative reference seems to have some kind of issue with the production of the authors' names.<br><br>I see several acknowledgements in section B.1 that will be removed prior to publication. The authors may wish to consider moving these names to section 7 for the sake of posterity.</div></td>

Perhaps s/such/ICMPv6/ (or PTB).<br><br>2: Sec 3: "Upon receipt of such a message, the<br>&nbsp;  source node reduces its assumed PMTU for the path based on the MTU of<br>&nbsp;  the constricting hop as reported in the Packet Too Big message" -- this says that it reduces it *for the path*. But (as somewhat alluded to later in the draft) the nodes doesn't know what the path *is* -- it can decrease for the destination, or flow, or even interface, but (unless it is strict source routing) it doesn't control or really know the path (see also #4)<br><br>3: Sec 4: "The recommended setting for this timer is twice its minimum value (10 minutes)." - as above. This was from 1996 - were these metrics discussed at all during the -bis? I suspect that the average flow is much shorter these days (more web traffic, fatter pipes, etc) and so a flow of 10 minutes seems really long (to me at least). <br><br>4: Sec 5.2: "The packetization layers must be notified about decreases in the<br>&nbsp;  PMTU.&nbsp; Any packetization layer instance (for example, a TCP<br>&nbsp;  connection) that is actively using the path must be notified if the<br>&nbsp;  PMTU estimate is decreased.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: even if the Packet Too Big message contains an Original<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Packet Header that refers to a UDP packet, the TCP layer must be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; notified if any of its connections use the given path."<br> - this is related to #2 -- I don't know *which* path my packets take - once I launch them into the void, they may be routed purely based upon destination IP address, or they may be hashed based upon some set of header fields to a particular ECMP link or LSP. Once packets hit a load balancer, it is probably even *likely* that the UDP and TCP packets end up on different things. So, if I get a PTB from a router somewhere, I can probably guess that other packets to the same destination address will also follow that path, but I cannot know that for sure. I'm fine to decrease MTU towards that destination IP, but is that what this is suggesting? If so, please say that. If not, please let me know what I should do. The above is even more tricky / fun when I'm using flow id as the flow identifier -- if I get a PTB for flow 0x1234, what do I do? <br><br> 5: Sec 5.3: "Once a minute, a timer-driven procedure runs through all cached PMTU values, and for each PMTU whose timestamp is not "reserved" and is older than the timeout interval ...". Please consider providing clarifications here. The wording implies that I should set a timer to fire on the minute, and trigger the behavior. If all of the (NTP synced!) machines in my datacenter do this, and all try send bigger packets (on 1/10th of long flows) their first hop router will get many, many over-sized packets and it will severely rate-limit the PTBs. <br><br><br>Nits (Some of these are purely academic.)<br>I understand that you are trying to limit the changes, so feel free to ignore these:<br><br>1: "A node sending packets much smaller than the Path<br>MTU allows is wasting network resources and probably getting<br>suboptimal throughput." - the "much" confuses me. If I'm using anything less than the MTU I'm wasting network resources and getting suboptimal throughput - I might not care, but if (used MTU) &lt; (path MTU) I'm wasting resources.<br><br>2: "Nodes implementing Path MTU Discovery and sending packets larger than<br>the IPv6 minimum link MTU are susceptible to problematic connectivity<br>if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted." The "implementing Path MTU Discovery and" seems redundant. ALL nodes sending packets larger than minimum MTU are "susceptible to problematic connectivity if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted.". I get what you are trying to say, but my OCD tendencies would not allow me to ignore this... <br><br>3: "In the case of multipath routing (e.g., Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP),"- this is vague / confusing -- (Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP) makes it sound like either ECMP is an acronym for Equal Cost Multipath Routing, or that ECMP is something different to Equal Cost Multipath Routing.<br>I'd suggest just dropping the "ECMP" (or, "Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing", but that seems clumsy)</div></td>

If all of the (NTP synced!) machines in my datacenter do this, and all try send bigger packets (on 1/10th of long flows) their first hop router will get many, many over-sized packets and it will severely rate-limit the PTBs. <br><br><br>Nits (Some of these are purely academic.)<br>I understand that you are trying to limit the changes, so feel free to ignore these:<br><br>1: "A node sending packets much smaller than the Path<br>MTU allows is wasting network resources and probably getting<br>suboptimal throughput." - the "much" confuses me. If I'm using anything less than the MTU I'm wasting network resources and getting suboptimal throughput - I might not care, but if (used MTU) &lt; (path MTU) I'm wasting resources.<br><br>2: "Nodes implementing Path MTU Discovery and sending packets larger than<br>the IPv6 minimum link MTU are susceptible to problematic connectivity<br>if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted." The "implementing Path MTU Discovery and" seems redundant. ALL nodes sending packets larger than minimum MTU are "susceptible to problematic connectivity if ICMPv6 [ICMPv6] messages are blocked or not transmitted.". I get what you are trying to say, but my OCD tendencies would not allow me to ignore this... <br><br>3: "In the case of multipath routing (e.g., Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP),"- this is vague / confusing -- (Equal Cost Multipath Routing, ECMP) makes it sound like either ECMP is an acronym for Equal Cost Multipath Routing, or that ECMP is something different to Equal Cost Multipath Routing.<br>I'd suggest just dropping the "ECMP" (or, "Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing", but that seems clumsy)</div></td>

This discuss concerns a few sentence all over the document and most parts of section 5.4. Details proposals below:<br><br>I propose to either remove this sentence, or at least reword to the following (or something similar):<br>OLD:<br>"Retransmission should be done for only for those packets that are<br>&nbsp;  known to be dropped, as indicated by a Packet Too Big message."<br>NEW:<br>"The IP layer may indicate loss to the upper layer protocol of those packets that are<br>&nbsp;  known to be dropped, as indicated by a Packet Too Big message."<br>Or MAY or SHOULD or MUST...?<br><br>Subsequently the following sentence should be removed as well:<br>"An upper layer must not retransmit data in response to an increase in<br>&nbsp;  the PMTU estimate, since this increase never comes in response to an<br>&nbsp;  indication of a dropped packet."<br><br>And here is the bigger change in section 5.4:<br>OLD<br>"When a Packet Too Big message is received, it implies that a packet<br>&nbsp;  was dropped by the node that sent the ICMPv6 message.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  sufficient to treat this in the same way as any other dropped<br>&nbsp;  segment, and will be recovered by normal retransmission methods.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  the Path MTU Discovery process requires several steps to find the<br>&nbsp;  PMTU of the full path, this could delay the connection by many round-<br>&nbsp;  trip times.<br><br>&nbsp;  Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response<br>&nbsp;  to a notification that the Path MTU has changed, but only for the<br>&nbsp;  specific connection specified by the Packet Too Big message.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  packet size used in the retransmission should be no larger than the<br>&nbsp;  new PMTU."<br>NEW<br>"When a Packet Too Big message is received, it implies that a packet<br>&nbsp;  was dropped by the node that sent the ICMPv6 message.&nbsp; A reliable <br>&nbsp;  upper layer protocol will detect the loss of this segment, and recover<br>&nbsp;  it by its normal retransmission methods.&nbsp; Depending on the loss <br>&nbsp;  detection method that is used by the upper layer protocol, this <br>&nbsp;  could delay the connection by many round-trip times.<br><br>&nbsp;  Alternatively, the retransmission could be done in immediate response<br>&nbsp;  to a notification that the Path MTU was decreased, but only for the<br>&nbsp;  specific connection specified by the Packet Too Big message.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  packet size used in the retransmission should be no larger than the<br>&nbsp;  new PMTU."<br><br>I don't understand the following paragraph. Can this be removed?<br>"Note: A packetization layer must not retransmit in response to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; every Packet Too Big message, since a burst of several oversized<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; segments will give rise to several such messages and hence several<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; retransmissions of the same data.&nbsp; If the new estimated PMTU is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; still wrong, the process repeats, and there is an exponential<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; growth in the number of superfluous segments sent."<br><br>The following text is fine but probably is not needed if the whole document is reworded accordingly to ensure that retransmissions are solely the responsibility of the upper layer protocol: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "Retransmissions can increase network load in response to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; congestion, worsening that congestion.&nbsp; Any packetization layer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that uses retransmission is responsible for congestion control of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its retransmissions.&nbsp; See [<a href="/doc/rfc8085/">RFC8085</a>] for more information."<br><br>This can also be removed, because a reliable protocol that detected loss and decided to send a retransmission, should and will do the same processing as for all other retransmissions, e.g. reset the retransmission time in TCP. Mentioning this separately is rather confusing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This means that the TCP layer must be able to recognize when a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Packet Too Big notification actually decreases the PMTU that it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; has already used to send a packet on the given connection, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should ignore any other notifications."<br><br>And this is even incorrect. Slow start means that you will increase the connection window exponentially. Only sending one segment means setting the congestion/sending window to one. I propose the following change:<br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  "Many TCP implementations incorporate "congestion avoidance" and<br>&nbsp;  "slow-start" algorithms to improve performance [CONG].&nbsp; Unlike a<br>&nbsp;  retransmission caused by a TCP retransmission timeout, a<br>&nbsp;  retransmission caused by a Packet Too Big message should not change<br>&nbsp;  the congestion window.&nbsp; It should, however, trigger the slow-start<br>&nbsp;  mechanism (i.e., only one segment should be retransmitted until<br>&nbsp;  acknowledgements begin to arrive again)."<br>NEW<br>"A loss caused by a PMTU probe indicated by the reception of a Packet Too Big message MUST NOT be considered as a congestion notification and hence the congestion window may not change."<br><br>And I also don't understand this sentence:<br>"TCP performance can be reduced if the sender's maximum window size is<br>&nbsp;  not an exact multiple of the segment size in use (this is not the<br>&nbsp;  congestion window size)."</div></td>

Maybe you can be more explicit here and even say something like pmtu discovery should/must only be used if the upper layer protocol provides means for validation of the icmp payload (like a sequence number in TCP)…?<br><br>Further also note that if the upper layer does the validation while the IP layer maintains EMTU_S, there must be an interface from the upper layer to the IP layer to tell if a packet is valid or not before the IP layer updates the MTU estimate. This seems actually more complicated than this one sentences indicates.<br><br>2) Also as Ekr says, I also have problems to fully understand this normative text in section 4:<br>"After receiving a Packet Too Big message, a node MUST attempt to<br>&nbsp;  avoid eliciting more such messages in the near future.&nbsp; The node MUST<br>&nbsp;  reduce the size of the packets it is sending along the path.&nbsp; Using a<br>&nbsp;  PMTU estimate larger than the IPv6 minimum link MTU may continue to<br>&nbsp;  elicit Packet Too Big messages.&nbsp; Since each of these messages (and<br>&nbsp;  the dropped packets they respond to) consume network resources, the<br>&nbsp;  node MUST force the Path MTU Discovery process to end.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nodes using Path MTU Discovery MUST detect decreases in PMTU as fast<br>&nbsp;  as possible."<br>I especially don't understand the first part, given that a PTB message may still indicate a MTU that is larger than the minimum link MTU which then may cause another PTB message later on the path. This text reads like if you receive one PTB message you should better end discovery and fall back to the minimum link MTU to avoid any further PTB message and not waist any resources. I don't think that's the intention and as such I don't understand when it is recommended to end discovery here...?<br><br>3) Section 5.2 seems to be written with only single homed hosts in mind. It might be good to advise that the pmtu information should always be stored on a per interface basis...?<br><br>4) Also section 5.2:<br>You only advise to store information per flow ID, however, if the flow label is not used, wouldn't it make really sense to just use the 5-tuple instead? Also note that EMCP is often done based on the 5-tuple or even 6-tuple (with the ToS field).<br><br>5) And more in section 5.2:<br>"When a Packet Too Big message is received, the node determines which<br>&nbsp;  path the message applies to based on the contents of the Packet Too<br>&nbsp;  Big message. "<br>MAYBE:<br>"When a valid Packet Too Big message is received, the node determines which<br>&nbsp;  path the message applies to based on the contents of the Packet Too<br>&nbsp;  Big message."<br>And further on:<br>"If the tentative PMTU is less than the existing PMTU estimate, the<br>&nbsp;  tentative PMTU replaces the existing PMTU as the PMTU value for the<br>&nbsp;  path."<br>This doesn't cover the case where a pmtu probe with a larger size was send and the PTB message returns a larger value then stored. Maybe state this explicitly.<br><br>This applies similar to this sentence in section 6:<br>OLD<br>"A node, however, should never raise its estimate of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PMTU based on a Packet Too Big message, so should not be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vulnerable to this attack.“<br>NEW<br>"A node, however, MUST NOT raise its estimate of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PMTU based on a Packet Too Big message that is not a (validated) response to a PMTU probe that was previously send by this node, so should not be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vulnerable to this attack."<br><br>6) Further section 5.2:<br>Should this statement be maybe upper case MUST:<br>"The packetization layers must be notified about decreases in the PMTU. "<br><br>7) Technical comment on section 5.3 in general:<br>There is a difference between aging if a flow is active or not. While I maybe don't want to probe again for this connection because my application already decided to use a mode where it can live with the current pmtu and it's too much effect to switch, I really want to probe at the beginning of the next connection again to check if I can use a different mode now. While the IP layer does not have a notion of connection it can observe if packets are frequently send with the same 5-tuple and reset the cached pmtu after a certain idle time.<br><br>8) Section 5.4: should this maybe be normative, at least the last MUST NOT (be fragmented):<br>"A packetization layer (e.g., TCP) must track the PMTU for the path(s)<br>&nbsp;  in use by a connection; it should not send segments that would result<br>&nbsp;  in packets larger than the PMTU, except to probe during PMTU<br>&nbsp;  discovery (this probe packet must not be fragmented to the PMTU).

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes Path MTU Discovery for IP version 6.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  largely derived from <a href="/doc/rfc1191/">RFC 1191</a>, which describes Path MTU Discovery for<br>&nbsp;  IP version 4.&nbsp; It obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was<br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where<br>the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  The 6MAN working started working on advancing the IPv6 core<br>&nbsp;  specifications to Internet Standard at IETF93 July 2015.&nbsp; See:<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/slides/slides-93-6man-3.pdf">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/slides/slides-93-6man-3.pdf</a> The<br>&nbsp;  working group identified three RFCs to update (<a href="/doc/rfc2460/">RFC2460</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc4291/">RFC4291</a>, and<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>) by incorporating updates from other RFCs and Errata, and<br>&nbsp;  three to advance in place <a href="/doc/rfc4443/">RFC4443</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3596/">RFC3596</a>, and <a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC4941</a>.&nbsp; After<br>&nbsp;  further analysis, the w.g. decided to not reclassify <a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC4941</a> at this<br>&nbsp;  time.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The working followed the requirements in <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC6410</a> for advancing a Draft<br>&nbsp;  Standard to Internet Standard.&nbsp; While <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC6410</a> describes how to handle<br>&nbsp;  Errata, it doesn't say anything about Updated-By RFCs.&nbsp; The working<br>&nbsp;  group, with the advice of our AD, incorporated the changes from the<br>&nbsp;  the Updated-By RFC and verified there was interoperability of the<br>&nbsp;  updates.<br><br>&nbsp;  All of the Updated-By and errata were brought into the new draft in<br>&nbsp;  small steps to allow thorough review of all of the changes.&nbsp; A summary<br>&nbsp;  and link to diff from the previous version was sent to the mailing<br>&nbsp;  list.&nbsp; All of the changes to each draft were also discussed in detail<br>&nbsp;  at IETF94, IETF95, IETF96, and IETF97.&nbsp; All of the changes from<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a> are summarized in Appendix B and are ordered by the Internet<br>&nbsp;  Draft that brought the change in.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document is an update to <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a> that was published prior to<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> being published.&nbsp; Consequently while it does use "should/must"<br>&nbsp;  style language in upper and lower case, the document does not cite the<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> definitions.&nbsp; Since the changes in this update were very<br>&nbsp;  limited, the w.g. concluded to not change any of this language.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  A working group last call for moving this and the other two documents<br>&nbsp;  to Internet Standard was started on 30 May 2016.&nbsp; Reviews were also<br>&nbsp;  requested.&nbsp; Issues found during the last call and reviews were entered<br>&nbsp;  into the 6MAN ticket system.&nbsp; These are now closed.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)?

If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has<br>indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No concerns.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  No IPR.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has had extensive review in the 6MAN working group and<br>&nbsp;  there is broad support to this version of the IPv6 specification as an<br>&nbsp;  Internet Standard.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No appeals have been threatened. <br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis will be submitted for Internet<br>&nbsp;  Standard with this draft.&nbsp; Also, this document uses capitalized MUST,<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD, etc. language, but doesn't reference <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> because it was<br>&nbsp;  originally written prior to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a>.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,<br>such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  The only normative reference this is not an RFC, is a reference to<br>&nbsp;  draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis. This draft is also being submitted to the<br>&nbsp;  IESG for Internet standard around the same time as this document.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing other than <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis/">draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis</a> discussed in the<br>&nbsp;  previous section.<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>. This is indicated in the header and<br>&nbsp; abstract.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.<br>Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed<br>specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations<br>procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name<br>for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not make any new assignments.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.

Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page<br>header?<br><br>&nbsp;  Internet Standard<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a> is currently at Draft Standard, the 6MAN working group has<br>&nbsp;  reached a consensus that it’s time to elevate the Path MTU Discovery<br>&nbsp;  for IP version 6 specification to Internet Standard.<br><br>&nbsp;  The header indicates “Standards Track”.<br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes Path MTU Discovery for IP version 6.&nbsp; It is<br>&nbsp;  largely derived from <a href="/doc/rfc1191/">RFC 1191</a>, which describes Path MTU Discovery for<br>&nbsp;  IP version 4.&nbsp; It obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was<br>there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where<br>the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  The 6MAN working started working on advancing the IPv6 core<br>&nbsp;  specifications to Internet Standard at IETF93 July 2015.&nbsp; See:<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/slides/slides-93-6man-3.pdf">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/93/slides/slides-93-6man-3.pdf</a> The<br>&nbsp;  working group identified three RFCs to update (<a href="/doc/rfc2460/">RFC2460</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc4291/">RFC4291</a>, and<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>) by incorporating updates from other RFCs and Errata, and<br>&nbsp;  three to advance in place <a href="/doc/rfc4443/">RFC4443</a>, <a href="/doc/rfc3596/">RFC3596</a>, and <a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC4941</a>.&nbsp; After<br>&nbsp;  further analysis, the w.g. decided to not reclassify <a href="/doc/rfc4941/">RFC4941</a> at this<br>&nbsp;  time.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The working followed the requirements in <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC6410</a> for advancing a Draft<br>&nbsp;  Standard to Internet Standard.&nbsp; While <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC6410</a> describes how to handle<br>&nbsp;  Errata, it doesn't say anything about Updated-By RFCs.&nbsp; The working<br>&nbsp;  group, with the advice of our AD, incorporated the changes from the<br>&nbsp;  the Updated-By RFC and verified there was interoperability of the<br>&nbsp;  updates.<br><br>&nbsp;  All of the Updated-By and errata were brought into the new draft in<br>&nbsp;  small steps to allow thorough review of all of the changes.&nbsp; A summary<br>&nbsp;  and link to diff from the previous version was sent to the mailing<br>&nbsp;  list.&nbsp; All of the changes to each draft were also discussed in detail<br>&nbsp;  at IETF94, IETF95, IETF96, and IETF97.&nbsp; All of the changes from<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a> are summarized in Appendix B and are ordered by the Internet<br>&nbsp;  Draft that brought the change in.<br><br>&nbsp;  A working group last call for moving this and the other two documents<br>&nbsp;  to Internet Standard was started on 30 May 2016.&nbsp; Reviews were also<br>&nbsp;  requested.&nbsp; Issues found during the last call and reviews were entered<br>&nbsp;  into the 6MAN ticket system.&nbsp; These are now closed.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  IPv6 is implemented on most platforms (hosts, routers, servers, etc.),<br>&nbsp;  including proprietary and open source.&nbsp; A list of products that have<br>&nbsp;  received the IPV6 Ready logo can be found at:<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/public/?o=4">https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/public/?o=4</a><br><br>&nbsp;  Most major ISP now support IPv6, as well as many mobile<br>&nbsp;  operators.<br><br>&nbsp;  Google’s IPv6 stats at<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html">https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html</a> show they are<br>&nbsp;  seeing now about 15% of their overall user traffic is IPv6. Country<br>&nbsp;  adoption is 29% in the US, Germany 27%, Finland 12%, Japan 14%, Brazil<br>&nbsp;  11%.&nbsp; IPv6 users per AS can be found at<br>&nbsp;  <a href="http://stats.labs.apnic.net/aspop">http://stats.labs.apnic.net/aspop</a><br><br>&nbsp;  The University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH)<br>&nbsp;  analyzed the incorporated updates to insure they were implemented and<br>&nbsp;  interoperable.&nbsp; No problems were found.&nbsp; Their report can be found at:<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-6man-2.pdf">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-6man-2.pdf</a><br><br>&nbsp;  No MIB, Media, or other expert reviews are required.<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Document Shepherd: Ole Trøan<br>&nbsp;  Responsible AD: Suresh Krishnan<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document was reviewed by the Document Shepherd and believes it is<br>&nbsp;  ready for publication.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has<br>indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No concerns.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  No IPR.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has had extensive review in the 6MAN working group and<br>&nbsp;  there is broad support to this version of the IPv6 specification as an<br>&nbsp;  Internet Standard.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No appeals have been threatened. <br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing serious.&nbsp; A few miscellaneous warning about line spacing and<br>&nbsp;  notice that the reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis/">draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis</a> is a down<br>&nbsp;  reference. Draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis will be submitted for Internet<br>&nbsp;  Standard with this draft.&nbsp; Also, this document uses capitalized MUST,<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD, etc. language, but doesn't reference <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> because it was<br>&nbsp;  originally written prior to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a>.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,<br>such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  The only normative reference this is not an RFC, is a reference to<br>&nbsp;  draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis. This draft is also being submitted to the<br>&nbsp;  IESG for Internet standard around the same time as this document.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nothing other than <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis/">draft-ietf-6man-rfc2460bis</a> discussed in the<br>&nbsp;  previous section.<br>&nbsp;  <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br><br><br>&nbsp; This document obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc1981/">RFC1981</a>. This is indicated in the header and<br>&nbsp; abstract.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.<br>Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed<br>specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations<br>procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name<br>for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not make any new assignments.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful<br>in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A<br><br><br></div></td>
