it's good to see this type of functional<br>requirements get written out clearly.&nbsp; That said, I'm not sure I<br>understand why this document is aiming for Proposed Standard status.&nbsp; It<br>seems to make normative requirements for DHCPv6 relay behavior, but does<br>not have an "Updates:" relationship with <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a> to indicate that<br>additional requirements are present.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are no<br>new protocol mechanisms to indicate that it is a protocol that would be<br>implemented on its own.&nbsp; Is it intended to play the role of an<br>Applicability Statement?<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;  The mechanisms for a relay to inject routes (including aggregated<br>&nbsp;  ones), on its network-facing interface based on prefixes learned from<br>&nbsp;  a server via DHCP-PD are out of scope of the document.<br><br>Just to check my understanding: the context suggests that the<br>"network-facing interface" here is the one on the DHCPv6 client side of<br>the relay, vs the server side.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; (Is the<br>"network-facing" terminology a term of art?)<br><br>&nbsp;  Delegating relay A delegating relay acts as an intermediate device,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forwarding DHCPv6 messages containing IA_PD/IAPREFIX<br><br>(I agree with Murray that clarification is in order here.)<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp;  It is an operational reality that client devices with duplicate MAC<br>&nbsp;  addresses and/or DUIDs exist and have been deployed.&nbsp; In this<br>&nbsp;  situation, the operational costs of locating and swapping out such<br>&nbsp;  devices are prohibitive.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  It should be noted that in some access networks, the MAC address and/<br>&nbsp;  or DUID are used as part of device identification and authentication.<br>&nbsp;  In such networks, enforcing MAC address/DUID uniqueness is a<br>&nbsp;  necessary function and not considered a problem.<br><br>It's not entirely clear to me that these two statements are entirely<br>consistent with each other -- are the costs prohibitive, or not a<br>problem?&nbsp; (Putting a caveat on the first statement that it also only<br>applies to "some" networks, would resolve the apparent disparity.)<br><br>Section 3.5<br><br>[that loop sounds pretty nasty; I look forward to seeing how it's<br>resolved]<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  G-6:&nbsp; &nbsp; The relay MUST implement a mechanism to limit the maximum<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  number of active prefix delegations on a single port for all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  client identifiers and IA_PDs.&nbsp; This value MUST be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  configurable.<br><br>This mechanism is important as a security/anti-DoS mechanism; I hope we<br>note that somewhere.<br><br>&nbsp;  G-8:&nbsp; &nbsp; The delegating relay MUST update the lease lifetimes based on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the Client Reply messages it forwards to the client and only<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  expire the delegated prefixes when the valid lifetime has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  elapsed.<br><br>(The string "Client Reply" does not appear in <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a>; I'm not sure why<br>it's capitalized as if it's a term of art.)<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  R-2:&nbsp; &nbsp; The delegating relay's routing entry MUST use the same prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  length for the delegated prefix as given in the IA_PD.<br><br>Could this requirement ever interfere with an aggregation scenario?<br>(What is it trying to prevent?)<br><br>&nbsp;  R-3:&nbsp; &nbsp; The relay MUST provide a mechanism to dynamically update<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ingress filters permitting ingress traffic sourced from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  client delegated leases and blocking packets from invalid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  source prefixes.&nbsp; This is to implement anti-spoofing as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP38</a>].&nbsp; The delegating relay's ingress filter<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  entry MUST use the same prefix length for the delegated<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  prefix as given in the IA_PD.<br><br>Is this imposing a more stringent requirement than <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP38</a> itself (which,<br>as far as I can tell, restricts itself to "all providers of Internet<br>connectivity are urged to implement filtering described in this<br>document" with no normative requirement.&nbsp; (To be clear, I'm not opposed<br>to this trend, just wondering if we should note the change more<br>prominently.)<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  O-1:&nbsp; &nbsp; The relay SHOULD implement an interface allowing the operator<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  to view the active delegated prefixes.&nbsp; This SHOULD provide<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  information about the delegated lease and client details such<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  as client identifier, next-hop address, connected interface,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and remaining lifetimes.<br><br>Is this something that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-yang/">draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-yang</a> would provide (and<br>thus merit an informative reference)?<br><br>Section 7<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not add any new security considerations beyond<br>&nbsp;  those mentioned in Section 22 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8213/">RFC8213</a>].<br><br>Thanks for queuing up the reference fix per the secdir review.<br>I guess both Section 22 of <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a> and all of <a href="/doc/rfc8213/">RFC 8213</a> are relevant?<br>Though perhaps the las paragraph of the section is intended to provide<br>the needed <a href="/doc/rfc8213/">RFC 8213</a> reference...<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8213/">RFC8213</a>] describes a method for securing traffic between the relay<br>&nbsp;  agent and server by sending DHCP messages over an IPsec tunnel.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  this case the IPsec tunnel is functionally the server-facing<br>&nbsp;  interface and DHCPv6 message snooping can be carried out as<br>&nbsp;  described.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that this is implemented by the<br>&nbsp;  delegating relay.<br><br>I do not see any reference to message snooping in <a href="/doc/rfc8213/">RFC 8213</a>; please<br>clearify.<br><br>Section 8.2<br><br>The discussion at<br><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/</a><br>combined with the way in which <a href="/doc/rfc4443/">RFC 4443</a> is referenced ("An ICMPv6 Type<br>1, Code 6 (Destination Unreachable, reject route to destination) error<br>message MAY be sent as per [<a href="/doc/rfc4443/">RFC4443</a>], section 3.1." suggest that <a href="/doc/rfc4443/">RFC<br>4443</a> would be more properly classified as a normative reference.</div></td>

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As document shepherd, I reviewed this document (or updated sections) many<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; times to assure that it is following the WG consensus and discussions and is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of good quality. In my opinion, the document is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. The document had good review in multiple WGs (primarily in dhc and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; v6ops).

If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No, there is no IPR filed against this document and hence there was no IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussion in the WG.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document has consensus from many, and many that tend to most<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; active. There were no indications that anyone disagrees with any of its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; material.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As document shepherd, I reviewed this document (or updated sections) many<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; times to assure that it is following the WG consensus and discussions and is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of good quality. In my opinion, the document is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. The document had good review in multiple WGs (primarily in dhc and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; v6ops). There was a lot of good discussion and debate on several issues to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; assure the requirements were correct and clearly communicated.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. It had the DHCP and IPv6 review based on the working groups involved<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in reviews and discussions.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no concerns or issues with any of the material.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp;  Almost, I have received confirmation (as of this writing, 11/20/2020) confirmation<br>&nbsp;  from 3 of the 4 authors; I should receive confirmation from the 4th shortly and<br>&nbsp;  will update this document when I do.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No, there is no IPR filed against this document and hence there was no IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussion in the WG.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document has consensus from many, and many that tend to most<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; active. There were no indications that anyone disagrees with any of its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; material.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The ID nits tool (in verbose mode) did not find any issues. My review of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; document did not find any issues.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no need for any formal review of this kind for this document.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. And, I agree with how the references were categorized.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  There are no downward normative references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This document has an IANA considerations section, but it states that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; it makes no requests to IANA - which is correct.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There were none and none are applicable.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It does not contain any YANG module.<br></div></td>
