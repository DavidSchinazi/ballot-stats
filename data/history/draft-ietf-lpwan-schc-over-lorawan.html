As I note inline in<br>the Section 5.6.3.5.1 comments, it seems like we might have internally<br>inconsistent guidance about whether a non-SCHC-ACK message indicates<br>receipt of the ACK (and thus that the device can discard the saved SCHC<br>ACK message).<br><br>It is interesting that we give (e.g., in §5.6.2.4, 5.6.3.4) the<br>Receiver-Abort format but not the Sender-Abort format.<br><br>It seems like we are perhaps playing a little fast and loose with the<br>requirements imposed by <a href="/doc/rfc8742/">RFC 8742</a>, in that it attempts to require various<br>aspects to be specified for each ruleID for each profile, but we do not<br>specify the full set of Rule IDs.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be worth a blanket<br>statement that the procedures we specify apply to all rule IDs using<br>this profile (unless otherwise specified by the configuration that<br>establishes the static context on both parties to the communication).<br><br>Section 2<br><br>Please expand EUI on first use, as it's not marked as "well-known" at<br><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt">https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt</a> .<br><br>Section 3<br><br>It seems like it might be useful to indicate in the figure where the<br>LoRaWAN network boundary is.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  LoRaWAN end-devices use a 32-bit network address (devAddr) to<br>&nbsp;  communicate with the Network Gateway over-the-air, this address might<br>&nbsp;  not be unique in a LoRaWAN network; devices using the same devAddr<br>&nbsp;  are distinguished by the Network Gateway based on the cryptographic<br>&nbsp;  signature appended to every LoRaWAN frame.<br><br>nit: the first comma is a comma splice, but the sentence already has a<br>semicolon.&nbsp; I think this paragraph should become at least two sentences.<br><br>&nbsp;  To communicate with the SCHC gateway, the Network Gateway MUST<br>&nbsp;  identify the devices by a unique 64-bit device identifier called the<br>&nbsp;  DevEUI.<br><br>Baking in a persistent identifier like this has privacy considerations.<br>Is DevEUI randomization going to be possible?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  As SCHC defines its own acknowledgment mechanisms, SCHC does not<br>&nbsp;  require to use LoRaWAN Confirmed frames.<br><br>nit: s/require to use/require use of/<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Data: MAC and application data.&nbsp; Application data are protected<br>&nbsp;

Is the FPort<br>contents enough, or would there be some other data needed as well?<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>Thank you for condsidering the <a href="/doc/rfc8064/">RFC 8064</a>/8065 risks and using ephemeral<br>IIDs tied to the application session!<br><br>Using the AppSKey for a purpose other than protecting LoRaWAN<br>application traffic is not great cryptographic hygiene.&nbsp; That said, I<br>recognize that it's chosen because we don't expect all LoRaWAN devices<br>to have any kind of cryptographic hash available and that limits the<br>options for key derivation.&nbsp; I would need to think a bit harder to tell<br>whether even something as simple as prepending a fixed constant block<br>before the DevEUI as CMAC input would provide any additional benefit.<br><br>[I did not attempt to verify the IID-generation example.]<br><br>Section 5.6.2<br><br>It might be nice to list the F/R parameters in the same order that <a href="/doc/rfc8742/">RFC<br>8742</a> (Section 8.2.4 or 8.4.3) does.<br><br>Also, a forward reference to the subsections that provide the layout of<br>the various fields would be appreciated.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; DTag: Size is 0 bit, not used.<br><br>We should probably say specifically that T is 0 bits.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Window index: encoded on W = 2 bits.&nbsp; So 4 windows are available.<br><br>Likewise, M is 2 bits.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; RCS: Use recommended calculation algorithm in [<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>].<br><br>It might be helpful to give a section reference into 8724 (and likewise<br>in §5.6.3).<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Retransmission timer: Set by the implementation depending on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; application requirements.<br><br>Can we give a default value that would be usable in many situations?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Last tile: it can be carried in a Regular SCHC Fragment, alone in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an All-1 SCHC Fragment or with any of these two methods.<br><br>So receivers have to be able to cope with receiving either version, too?<br><br>&nbsp;  For battery powered devices, it is RECOMMENDED to use the ACK<br>&nbsp;  mechanism at the end of each window instead of waiting until the end<br>&nbsp;  of all windows:<br><br>This is the Uplink section; won't whether/when to ACK be under the<br>control of the SCHC gateway, that may or may not know if the device is<br>battery-powered or not?<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; the SCHC sender SHOULD wait for the SCHC ACK from the SCHC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; receiver before sending tiles from the next window.&nbsp; If the SCHC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ACK is not received, it SHOULD send a SCHC ACK REQ up to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MAX_ACK_REQUESTS times, as described previously.<br><br>If no ACK is elicited, does it continue on to the next window or fail<br>the transmission?<br><br>&nbsp;  SCHC implementations MUST be compatible with both behaviors, and this<br>&nbsp;  selection is part of the rule context.<br><br>This is attaching a new property to each rule at the very end of the<br>section, which is easily ignored; I strongly recommend adding a<br>prominent note at the top of the section that "in addition to the<br>per-rule context parameters specified in [<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>], for uplink rules an<br>additional context parameter is added: whether or not to ack after each<br>window".<br><br>Section 5.6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; SCHC fragmentation reliability mode:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Unicast downlinks: ACK-Always.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Multicast downlinks: No-ACK, reliability has to be ensured by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the upper layer.&nbsp; This feature is OPTIONAL and may not be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  implemented by SCHC gateway.<br><br>I think you should say that the subsequent parameters only apply to the<br>ACK-Always case, since the No-ACK case does not need (I think?) any of<br>them except the rule ID.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; DTag: Size is 0 bit, not used.<br><br>Should probably mention T, again.<br><br>&nbsp;  Class A devices can only receive during an RX slot, following the<br>&nbsp;  transmission of an uplink.&nbsp; Therefore the SCHC gateway cannot<br>&nbsp;  initiate communication (e.g., start a new SCHC session).&nbsp; In order to<br>&nbsp;  create a downlink opportunity it is RECOMMENDED for Class A devices<br>&nbsp;  to send an uplink every 24 hours when no SCHC session is started,<br>&nbsp;  this is application specific and can be disabled.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Just to walk through this, if the SCHC gateway has more than 2 frames to<br>send to the device, after the device-initiated (every 24 hour)<br>transmission, the SCHC gateway will send the first two frames, and then<br>... each ACK from the device will also open up two receive slots, so the<br>exchange continues fairly synchronously until the SCHC gateway does not<br>have more data to transmit?&nbsp; Are there any cases (multiple losses) where<br>we might be reduced to a trickle of 20 bytes every 24 hours?<br><br>Section 5.6.3.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  _Note_: The device MUST keep this SCHC ACK message in memory until it<br>&nbsp;  receives a downlink SCHC Fragmentation Message (with FPort ==<br>&nbsp;  FPortDown) that is not a SCHC ACK REQ: it indicates that the SCHC<br>&nbsp;  gateway has received the SCHC ACK message.<br><br>I'm not sure that I understand how this works -- the previous paragraph<br>seemed to indicate that we had SCHC_ACK_REQ_DN_OPPORTUNITY greater than<br>one to allow for non-ACK-REQ (i.e., potentially higher priority) traffic<br>to get sent, which I assumed meant intermingled with the ACK REQs.&nbsp; But<br>the paragraph I quote here implies that any such intermingling would be<br>misinterpreted as receipt of the ACK.&nbsp; So, what is the expected behavior<br>when the SCHC gateway is retransmitting ACK REQ and also has other<br>downlink traffic to send?<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>This seems to just be reiterating behaviors stated in <a href="/doc/rfc8742/">RFC 8742</a>, with<br>specific numbers corrsponding to this profile.&nbsp; If so, it's not entirely<br>clear how much value there is in keeping the calculationsin the final<br>archival RFC.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>It's a little unfortunate that [lora-alliance-spec] doesn't have much in<br>the way of a security considerations section, which would cover that the<br>quality of RNG on device and join server is quite relevant for the<br>strength of the session keys.&nbsp; (Also, what Roman said.)<br><br>Please also add a mention of the privacy considerations for using the<br>persistent DevEUI as an identifier for communications between the SCHC<br>gateway and network gateway.&nbsp; (I assume that this is encrypted at least<br>as well as the regular LoRaWAN traffic, so there is not huge exposure,<br>but it seems like it is still worth documenting.)<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>Why is <a href="/doc/rfc8064/">RFC 8064</a> normative but not <a href="/doc/rfc8065/">RFC 8065</a>?&nbsp; We cite them in exactly the<br>same circumstances, so they should receive identical treatment.<br><br>Sectino 10.2<br><br>I think [lora-alliance-spec] should probably be listed as normative;<br>even if you try to implement LoRaWAN SCHC as a separate module than the<br>core LoRaWAN stack, you still need to know about integrating with the<br>FPort.<br><br>Similarly, since the <a href="/doc/rfc4493/">RFC 4493</a> AES-CMAC is used for generating the IID<br>(which is a MUST-level requirement), <a href="/doc/rfc4493/">RFC 4493</a> needs to be a normative<br>reference.&nbsp; (I note that <a href="/doc/rfc4493/">RFC 4493</a> is already listed at<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref/</a> so there is no process concern<br>in doing so.)<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>&nbsp;  In following examples "applicative payload" refers to the IPv6<br>&nbsp;  payload sent by the application to the SCHC layer.<br><br>This is a slightly unfortunate terminology choice, since we also use the<br>unadorned term "payload" to refer to (what I assume is) the IPv6<br>payload, i.e., the actual application data.<br><br>Appendix A.2<br><br>Compressing a 478 byte IPv6 packet down to 283 bytes is quite<br>impressive, almost unrealistically so, considering that the base IPv6<br>header is 40 bytes and we can only get a few more from (e.g.) UDP port<br>numbers and such.<br><br>Appendix A.3<br><br>This is again an impressive compression result for only IPv6+UDP input.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br>Proposed Standard. This matches the title page header (from -v10 onward).<br>This RFC specifies a profile for using SCHC (<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>) over the LoRaWAN networks: it picks some options and defines some parameters left open in the generic SCHC specification.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> has specified a generic framework for Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC), designed with Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) in mind.<br>LoRaWAN(R) is one such LPWAN technology.<br>This document describes parameters and modes of operation for efficiently using <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> over the LoraWAN networks.<br> <br>Working Group Summary:<br>There was no particular controversy or rough consensus to be noted.<br>The authors are affiliated with two companies that have a strong involvement both in the IETF LPWAN WG and in the LoRa Alliance.<br>Feedback and design considerations were received from other companies primarily involved in the LoRa Alliance.<br>Information has been delivered both ways between the two SDOs, so we beleive the interests of the LoRa Alliance are well addressed by this document.<br>There were technical discussions and design iterations regarding features allowing <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> to efficiently operate over quasi-bidirectional links, which were constructive and professional.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Implementations are under way at the companies the authors are affiliated with, and others.<br>There were thorough reviews of the document done by companies that are prominent members of the LoRa Alliance. This lead to slight adjustements to the protocol to operate efficiently over the quais-bidirectional links of LoRaWAN Class A devices, as mentioned above.<br>Several WG interim meetings and even a few dedicated telecoference were devoted to discussing this adjustments.<br>There were several thorough reviews done by the document shepherd, who happens to be a co-author of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>. This lead to the full exploitation of the potential of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, and even to some litlle changes to <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> itself during its last design stages.<br>No MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review was done nor needed. <br><br>Personnel:<br>The Sepherd is Dominique Barthel.<br>The Responsible Area Director is Eric Vincke. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br>As a co-author of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, the Shepherd has constantly monitored and commented on this document, which is the first to specify a profile for <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, from its inception.<br>In addition, the Shepherd specifically performed a thorough review of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-over-lorawan/00/">draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-over-lorawan-00</a> (may 2019) and -05 (dec 2019), as well as of all diffs between successive versions of this documents, checking for compliance with <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, completeness and adequation to LoRaWAN.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>No concern. This document was reviewed by the individuals most intimately familiar with <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> or with LoRaWAN.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br>No such review neded.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br>No such specific concern or issue.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Yes, each author has confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br>There has been one IPR disclosed regarding this draft. The disclosure happened before the end of the WGLC.<br>It has not generated any publicly visible discussion. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br>This document is the product of the work by a part of the LPWAN WG (the part that has an interest in using SCHC over LoRaWAN), but it has been followed and understood by other parts of the WG, which have interest in using SCHC over different but similar technologies, such as Sigfox.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>No threat of appeal or other extreme discontent<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br>The ID nit tool run on Aug 1st 2020 on draft version -08 shows 4 ASCII art drawing with lines too long, mostly by just a few characters.<br>The ID nit tool output does not show the severity of this issue, i.e., if this is considered an Error, a Flaw, a Warning or a Comments.<br>The shepherd therefore proceeds with the submission, while requesting the authors to rework the offending ASCII art.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br>None of content in this document.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br>All normative references are to published RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br>No downward normative reference.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>This document does not change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br>This document makes no requirement to IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br>This document makes no requirement to IANA.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br>No formal language section in this document.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br>No YANG module in this document.<br></div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br>Informational. This matches the title page header.<br>This RFC specifies a profile for using SCHC (<a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>) over the LoRaWAN networks: it picks some options and defines some parameters left open in the generic SCHC specification.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> has specified a generic framework for Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC), designed with Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) in mind.<br>LoRaWAN(R) is one such LPWAN technology.<br>This document describes parameters and modes of operation for efficiently using <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> over the LoraWAN networks.<br> <br>Working Group Summary:<br>There was no particular controversy or rough consensus to be noted.<br>The authors are affiliated with two companies that have a strong involvement both in the IETF LPWAN WG and in the LoRa Alliance.<br>Feedback and design considerations were received from other companies primarily involved in the LoRa Alliance.<br>Information has been delivered both ways between the two SDOs, so we beleive the interests of the LoRa Alliance are well addressed by this document.<br>There were technical discussions and design iterations regarding features allowing <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> to efficiently operate over quasi-bidirectional links, which were constructive and professional.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Implementations are under way at the companies the authors are affiliated with, and others.<br>There were thorough reviews of the document done by companies that are prominent members of the LoRa Alliance. This lead to slight adjustements to the protocol to operate efficiently over the quais-bidirectional links of LoRaWAN Class A devices, as mentioned above.<br>Several WG interim meetings and even a few dedicated telecoference were devoted to discussing this adjustments.<br>There were several thorough reviews done by the document shepherd, who happens to be a co-author of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>. This lead to the full exploitation of the potential of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, and even to some litlle changes to <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> itself during its last design stages.<br>No MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review was done nor needed. <br><br>Personnel:<br>The Sepherd is Dominique Barthel.<br>The Responsible Area Director is Eric Vincke. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br>As a co-author of <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, the Shepherd has constantly monitored and commented on this document, which is the first to specify a profile for <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, from its inception.<br>In addition, the Shepherd specifically performed a thorough review of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-over-lorawan/00/">draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-over-lorawan-00</a> (may 2019) and -05 (dec 2019), as well as of all diffs between successive versions of this documents, checking for compliance with <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a>, completeness and adequation to LoRaWAN.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>No concern. This document was reviewed by the individuals most intimately familiar with <a href="/doc/rfc8724/">RFC8724</a> or with LoRaWAN.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br>No such review neded.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br>No such specific concern or issue.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Yes, each author has confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br>There has been one IPR disclosed regarding this draft. The disclosure happened before the end of the WGLC.<br>It has not generated any publicly visible discussion. <br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br>This document is the product of the work by a part of the LPWAN WG (the part that has an interest in using SCHC over LoRaWAN), but it has been followed and understood by other parts of the WG, which have interest in using SCHC over different but similar technologies, such as Sigfox.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>No threat of appeal or other extreme discontent<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br>The ID nit tool run on Aug 1st 2020 on draft version -08 shows 4 ASCII art drawing with lines too long, mostly by just a few characters.<br>The ID nit tool output does not show the severity of this issue, i.e., if this is considered an Error, a Flaw, a Warning or a Comments.<br>The shepherd therefore proceeds with the submission, while requesting the authors to rework the offending ASCII art.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br>None of content in this document.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br>All normative references are to published RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br>No downward normative reference.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br>This document does not change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br>This document makes no requirement to IANA.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br>This document makes no requirement to IANA.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br>No formal language section in this document.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br>No YANG module in this document.<br></div></td>
