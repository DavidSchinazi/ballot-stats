 A TCP implementation MUST use the above type of "clock" for clock-<br>&nbsp;  driven selection of initial sequence numbers (MUST-8), and SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  generate its Initial Sequence Numbers with the expression:<br><br>&nbsp;  ISN = M + F(localip, localport, remoteip, remoteport, secretkey)<br><br>and:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  +&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> [37] section 5 describes a potential blind data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; injection attack, and mitigation that implementations MAY<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; choose to include (MAY-12).&nbsp; TCP stacks that implement<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> MUST add an input check that the ACK value is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br><br>What prevents us from making a MUST-level requirement for randomized<br>ISNs?&nbsp; Is it just the fact that it was only a SHOULD in <a href="/doc/rfc6528/">RFC 6528</a> and a<br>perception that promoting to a MUST would be incompatible with retaining<br>Internet Standard status?<br><br>Likewise, what prevents using stronger normative language (e.g., MUST)<br>for the <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> protections?<br><br>It seems to me that these mechanisms are of general applicability and<br>provide significant value for use of TCP on the internet, even though<br>they are not fully robust and do not use cryptographic mechanisms.&nbsp; If<br>there are scenarios where their use is harmful or even just not<br>applicable, that seems like an exceptional case that should get<br>documented so as to strengthen the general recommendation for the<br>non-exception cases.<br><br><br>(2) I think this is just a process question to ensure that the IESG<br>knows what we are approving at Internet Standard maturity, though it<br>is certainly possible that I misunderstand the situation.<br><br>In Section 3.7.3 we see the normative statement (SHLD-6) that "when the<br>when the effective MTU of an interface varies packet-to- packet, TCP<br>implementations SHOULD use the smallest effective MTU of the interface<br>to calculate the value to advertise in the MSS option".&nbsp; This seems to<br>originate in <a href="/doc/rfc6691/">RFC 6691</a> (being obsoleted by this document), but <a href="/doc/rfc6691/">RFC 6691</a><br>is only an Informational document and has not had an opportunity to<br>"accumulate experience at Proposed Standard before progressing", to<br>paraphrase <a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC 6410</a>.<br><br>Similarly, Section 3.9.2 has (SHLD-23) "Generally, an application SHOULD<br>NOT change the DiffServ field value during the course of a connection<br>(SHLD-23)."&nbsp; This is a bit harder to track down, as the DiffServ field<br>was not always known by that name.&nbsp; I actually failed to find a directly<br>analogous previous statement of this guidance (presumably my error), and<br>thus don't know if it had any experience at the PS level or not.<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6410/">RFC 6410</a> seems pretty clear that some revisions are okay in Internet<br>Standards without such "bake time" at PS, but it does seem like<br>something that should be done consciously rather than by accident.<br><br>(3) This is also a process point for explicit consideration by the IESG.<br><br>Appendix A.2 appears to discuss a few (rare) scenarios in which the<br>technical mechanisms of this document fail catastrophically (e.g.,<br>getting stuck in a SYN|ACK loop and failing to complete the handshake).<br>Does this meet the "resolved known design choices" and "no known<br>technical omission" bar required by <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> even for *proposed*<br>standard?<br><br>(Note that <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> explicitly says that the IESG may waive this<br>requirement, at least for PS.)<br><br><br>(AFAICT one such scenario is reported at<br><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=3305">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=3305</a> , which the change<br>log for this document calls out as "not applicable due to other<br>changes"; I am not sure which "other changes" are intended, for this<br>case.)<br><br>(4) Another point mostly just to get explicit IESG acknowledgment<br>(elevating one of Lars' comments to DISCUSS level, essentially).<br><br>As the changelog (and gen-art reviewer!) notes:<br><br>&nbsp;

I'm happy to note that<br>FreeBSD is using siphash for this purpose, which should be more than<br>adequate.&nbsp; I expect that Linux and other major TCP stacks are already<br>doing something similar, so the guidance to use MD5 may be dated in<br>practice as well as in utility.<br><br>I don't have a great proposal for where to put some updated guidance<br>(unless there's already some work underway in tcpm?);

 effective MTU minus the fixed IP and TCP headers.&nbsp; By ignoring both<br>&nbsp;  IP and TCP options when calculating the value for the MSS option, if<br>&nbsp;  there are any IP or TCP options to be sent in a packet, then the<br>&nbsp;  sender must decrease the size of the TCP data accordingly.&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc6691/">RFC 6691</a><br>&nbsp;  [42] discusses this in greater detail.<br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/rfc6691/">RFC 6691</a> is obsoleted by this document; it seems to me that<br>if we think there is useful content still in that document, we should<br>include such content in this document instead of referring to a document<br>we are calling obsolete.&nbsp; (This is not the only place we do so, to be<br>clear, but I will try to mention it just once.&nbsp; I do see the note that<br>we only claim to incorporate the normative portions of most of the<br>obsoleted specs, leaving the informational content alone.)<br><br>Section 3.8.4<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation SHOULD send a keep-alive segment with no data<br>&nbsp;  (SHLD-12); however, it MAY be configurable to send a keep-alive<br>&nbsp;  segment containing one garbage octet (MAY-6), for compatibility with<br>&nbsp;  erroneous TCP implementations.<br><br>Such misbehaved TCP impelementations were misbehaved even in 1989 when<br><a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC 1122</a> was published -- do we have a sense for whether they are still<br>around to any significant degree?<br><br>Section 3.8.5<br><br>&nbsp;  As a result of implementation differences and middlebox interactions,<br>&nbsp;  new applications SHOULD NOT employ the TCP urgent mechanism (SHLD-<br>&nbsp;  13).&nbsp; However, TCP implementations MUST still include support for the<br>&nbsp;  urgent mechanism (MUST-30).&nbsp; Details can be found in <a href="/doc/rfc6093/">RFC 6093</a> [38].<br><br>This "SHOULD NOT employ" has been in force for over a decade (<a href="/doc/rfc6093/">RFC 6093</a><br>is dated January 2011).&nbsp; How long do we have to wait until there are<br>sufficiently few implementations employing the urgent mechanism that it<br>no longer needs to be implemented?<br><br>Section 3.9.2.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An incoming SYN with an invalid source address MUST be ignored<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; either by TCP or by the IP layer (MUST-63) (Section 3.2.1.3 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [18]).<br><br>Requirements of the form "A or B must do X" that are ambiguous about<br>whether A or B takes the action leave the risk that both will expect the<br>other party to take the action, and the action will fail to occur.&nbsp; If<br>we're in a position to specifically require one (or both!) to check,<br>that leads to a more robust and verifiable system.&nbsp; (I assume we're not<br>in such a position, but it can't hurt to check.)<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  TCP endpoint is willing to receive.&nbsp; Thus, the local TCP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  endpoint considers that segments overlapping the range<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RCV.NXT to RCV.NXT + RCV.WND - 1 carry acceptable data or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  control.&nbsp; Segments containing sequence numbers entirely<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  outside of this range are considered duplicates and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  discarded.<br><br>Duplicates or injection attacks (when the sequence numbers in the<br>segment are too large).<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  The collection of applicable RFC Errata that have been reported and<br>&nbsp;  either accepted or held for an update to <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> were incorporated<br>&nbsp;  (Errata IDs: 573, 574, 700, 701, 1283, 1561, 1562, 1564, 1565, 1571,<br>&nbsp;

 The more secure Initial Sequence Number generation algorithm from <a href="/doc/rfc6528/">RFC<br>&nbsp;  6528</a> was incorporated.&nbsp; See <a href="/doc/rfc6528/">RFC 6528</a> for discussion of the attacks<br>&nbsp;  that this mitigates, as well as advice on selecting PRF algorithms<br>&nbsp;  and managing secret key data.<br><br>(As I mentioned up in §3.4, that guidance is no longer current.)<br><br>Section 9.1<br><br>It's not clear to me that <a href="/doc/rfc2675/">RFC 2675</a> ([5]) needs to be classified as<br>normative.<br><br>The guidance at<br><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/">https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/normative-informative-references/</a><br>would suggest that <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> ([37]) should be classified as normative,<br>since we replicate its MUST-level requirements with the condition that<br>"TCP stacks that implement <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> MUST [...]", which would appear to<br>make that behavior an "optional feature".<br><br>Appendix A.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;

 combined to serve as the core specification for TCP [48].&nbsp; Over time,<br>&nbsp;  a number of errata have been filed against <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a>, as well as<br>&nbsp;  deficiencies in security, performance, and many other aspects.&nbsp; The<br><br>A naive parse would say that this means a number of errata have been<br>filed against deficiencies.&nbsp; I suspect the transition between errata and<br>deficiencies should refer to deficiencies having been "discovered" or<br>similar.<br><br>&nbsp;  The purpose of this document is to bring together all of the IETF<br>&nbsp;  Standards Track changes that have been made to the base TCP<br>&nbsp;  functional specification and unify them into an update of <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a>.<br><br>It's a little surprising to see this described as an "update of <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a>"<br>(vs. a "replacement of" or "updated version of") since the relationship<br>is Obsoletes, not Updates.&nbsp; I might even consider "into a single<br>consolidated specification".<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Options: [TCP Option]; Options#Size == (DOffset-5)*32; present<br>&nbsp;  only when DOffset &gt;

 maintenance of a TCP connection requires the remembering of several<br>&nbsp;  variables.&nbsp; We conceive of these variables being stored in a<br><br>"the remembering of" is a fairly awkward phrase, where something like<br>just "remembering" or "maintaining state for" would flow more naturally.<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp;

 explanation for this specification is given.&nbsp; TCP implementors may<br>&nbsp;  violate the "quiet time" restriction, but only at the risk of causing<br>&nbsp;  some old data to be accepted as new or new data rejected as old<br>&nbsp;  duplicated by some receivers in the internet system.<br><br>Maybe "old duplicated data"?&nbsp; The current phrasing feels like it's<br>missing a word.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hosts that prefer to avoid waiting are<br>&nbsp;  willing to risk possible confusion of old and new packets at a given<br>&nbsp;  destination may choose not to wait for the "quiet time".<br><br>I think this needs an "and", for "prefer to avoid waiting and are<br>willing to risk".<br><br>&nbsp;  To summarize: every segment emitted occupies one or more sequence<br>&nbsp;  numbers in the sequence space, the numbers occupied by a segment are<br>&nbsp;  "busy" or "in use" until MSL seconds have passed, upon rebooting a<br>&nbsp;  block of space-time is occupied by the octets and SYN or FIN flags of<br>&nbsp;  the last emitted segment, if a new connection is started too soon and<br>&nbsp;  uses any of the sequence numbers in the space-time footprint of the<br>&nbsp;  last segment of the previous connection incarnation, there is a<br>&nbsp;  potential sequence number overlap area that could cause confusion at<br>&nbsp;  the receiver.<br><br>This list seems to be missing an "and".<br>(Also, is it really only the last emitted segment that could cause<br>problems?)<br><br>Section 3.5<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; If an incoming segment has a security level, or compartment that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; does not exactly match the level and compartment requested for the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connection, a reset is sent and the connection goes to the CLOSED<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.&nbsp; The reset takes its sequence number from the ACK field of<br><br>The comma in the first line is no longer needed (it was part of the list<br>when precedence was still part of the list).<br><br>Section 3.6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; outgoing segment queue.&nbsp; No further SENDs from the user will be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accepted by the TCP implementation, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.&nbsp; RECEIVEs are allowed in this state.&nbsp; All segments<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; preceding and including FIN will be retransmitted until<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; acknowledged.&nbsp; When the other TCP peer has both acknowledged the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first TCP peer can ACK this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FIN.&nbsp; Note that a TCP endpoint receiving a FIN will ACK but not<br>&nbsp;

 Note that there are several current practices that further lead to a<br>&nbsp;  reduced number of ACKs, including generic receive offload (GRO), ACK<br>&nbsp;  compression, and ACK decimation [26].<br><br>Reference [26] seems reasonable for ACK decimation and ACK compression,<br>but doesn't seem to cover GRO at all.<br><br>Section 3.9.1<br><br>&nbsp;

Thanks also for the clear and illuminating shepherd write-up.<br><br>Below are some comments I hope will be helpful.<br><br>1. Regarding in §1,<br><br>&nbsp; The purpose of this document is to bring together all of the IETF<br>&nbsp; Standards Track changes that have been made to the base TCP<br>&nbsp; functional specification and unify them into an update of [<a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a>].<br><br>It also incorporates Informational documents, right? For example, <a href="/doc/rfc6691/">RFC 6691</a> is Informational, as is 6429. So, these are being elevated, by virtue of their incorporation, to Standards Track. I'm not saying that's a problem, but the quoted text, while technically accurate I suppose (it doesn't say "exclusively Standards Track changes" after all) is misleading.<br><br>2. Regarding, in §3.4,<br><br>&nbsp; A new acknowledgment (called an "acceptable ack"), is one for which<br>&nbsp; the inequality below holds:<br><br>&nbsp;  SND.UNA &lt; SEG.ACK =&lt; SND.NXT<br><br>I’m having a hard time seeing why the first part of the inequality is &lt; and not =&lt;. Wouldn’t =&lt; be the case when a single new byte is being acknowledged? (Based on the definition that SND.UNA is the “oldest unacknowledged sequence number” and therefore, presumably needs to be acknowledged.) I do see this text is unchanged from <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> so I am very likely wrong, but I’d appreciate knowing WHY I’m wrong…<br><br>3. Regarding, in §3.4,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  even if data rates escalate to 10's of megabits/sec. At 100<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  megabits/sec, the cycle time is 5.4 minutes, which may be a little<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  short, but still within reason.<br><br>I realize this is, again, inherited from <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> but it seems hopelessly quaint in 2021 and not suitable for publication today. I mean, my unexceptional commodity home connection is 1 Gbps and it just goes up from there. At 100 Gbps we’re down to a cycle time of ~300 msec which no longer seems so easy to brush off as "still within reason". I’m not suggesting this document has to fix the problem, and indeed I’m aware there are other documents for this purpose — but does the outdated text have to be retained? <br><br>4. The parenthetical reference to “User Telnet” in §3.8.3 seemed equally anachronistic. Seems like it could just be removed. <br><br>5. It made me sad while reviewing the document, that certain sections were stingy with subsection numbering. In particular §3.4 has the unnumbered subheadings "Initial Sequence Number Selection", "Knowing When to Keep Quiet", and "The TCP Quiet Time Concept", and §3.5 has "Half-Open Connections and Other Anomalies", "Reset Generation", and "Reset Processing". I think it would make the document more usable if these were numbered, as we tend to do in the modern era, and as the rest of the document does do. (I may have missed some, the list above isn't necessarily exhaustive.)<br><br>Nits:<br><br>6. I found it odd that figure 11 uses Z and X as the sequence numbers, whereas all the previous illustrations used actual numbers. It works of course, but it's inconsistent.<br><br>7. In §3.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  The control bits are also know as "flags"<br><br>&nbsp;  S/know/known/<br><br>8. In §3.1, “one’s complement” should be “ones’ complement”. <br><br>9. In §3.3.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  transitions are not not explicitly shown<br><br>&nbsp;  Presumably the double negation isn’t isn't deliberate. :-)<br><br>10. In §3.4:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; next sequence number expected on an incoming segments<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Should be segment, singular. <br><br>11. In §3.4:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; sequence space occupying controls<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I think this needs, or at least would be better with, a hyphen: “sequence space-occupying controls”<br><br>12. In several places, "anyways" should probably be "anyway". (At least my dictionary suggests the change.)<br><br>13. In §3.4:<br><br>&nbsp; Hosts that prefer to avoid waiting are<br>&nbsp; willing to risk possible confusion of old and new packets at a given<br>&nbsp; destination may choose not to wait for the "quiet time".<br><br>“Are willing” should be “and are willing”<br><br>14. In §3.6:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the user can terminate his side gracefully<br><br>Perhaps consider a non-gendered pronoun such as "their"?<br><br>15.

Perhaps “<a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC 1122</a> required implementation of Van Jacobson’s congestion control algorithms, slow start, and congestion avoidance, together with“?<br><br>16. “Internet” is inconsistently capitalized throughout, probably corresponding to age of the text. But I suppose the RFCEd will fix this.</div></td>

It has been long since I read the whole TCP specification, I refreshed myself a lot when reviewing this. Thanks for that experience.<br><br>I have some comments/questions below. By addressing those, I hope will improve the document even better:<br><br>* Section 3.1 : says --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that the list of options may be shorter than the data offset field might imply. The content of the header beyond the End-of-Option option must be header padding (i.e., zero). <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  Should this be a normative MUST?<br><br>* Passive open and active open should be defined/described. Even if these are well known terms in the community, a verbose description of passive/active open will be much appreciated in this document context. if they are defined somewhere else then I have missed that, in that case a reference would be more appropriate.<br><br>* Section 3.4 : says --<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are security issues that result if an off-path attacker is able to predict or guess ISN values. <br><br>&nbsp;  A reference to this claim would be highly appreciated. May be we can reuse some ref from 41?<br>&nbsp;  I also think "Initial Sequence Number Selection", "Knowing When to Keep Quiet" and "The TCP Quiet Time Concept" should be numbered subtitles.<br><br>* Section 3.5 : can we put some reference for "security level or compartment"? A pointer to the appendix A.1 should be enough here.<br><br>* Section 3.8.1 : says --<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> contains an early example procedure for computing the RTO. This was then replaced by the algorithm described in <a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC 1122</a>, and subsequently updated in <a href="/doc/rfc2988/">RFC 2988</a>, and then again in <a href="/doc/rfc6298/">RFC 6298</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; I am not sure what am I supposed to do with this information. Suggest to remove this paragraph.<br><br>* Section 3.8.5 : describes --<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; A TCP implementation MUST support a sequence of urgent data of any length (MUST-31). [18]<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; I am not sure what is the reference for? if this is to say this MUST is taken from [18] as described there then to me this reference also should be normative.</div></td>

If approved, the document should replace <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> as "STD 7".<br><br><br>2. Review and Consensus<br><br>The TCPM working group has worked on this document for more than 6 years, and many TCPM contributors have reviewed the specification during that time. In particular, many TCP implementers have provided detailed comments based on operational experience. The document was relatively stable in the latest versions. During and after WGLC, several comprehensive reviews flagged some open issues that all got resolved.<br><br>793bis improves the specification of TCP but it does not modify the TCP protocol. TCP is a complex protocol and even minor wording details in the protocol specification can matter. Given the restriction to TCP changes that already have IETF consensus, there has never been any major controversy about the main content.<br><br>Nonetheless, several questions were non-trivial and triggered longer discussions in TCPM. These issues can roughly be subdivided in three categories:<br><br>1/ Being published in 1981, <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> defines several protocol mechanisms that have become outdated and may not be implemented at all in a modern TCP/IP stack. However, in some cases the corresponding specification in <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> never got updated or obsoleted and is still formally valid. Appendix A.1 summarizes some of these issues. The TCPM consensus for those cases is to document the issues in 793bis, but not to change the TCP standards. The required changes to the TCP standards should be handled by dedicated, narrow-focused RFCs that would have to reach IETF consensus first. This de-risk strategy ensures that each TCP protocol change can be properly and comprehensively reviewed.<br><br>2/ There are some known issues in the standards-track specification of TCP that exist but only matter in corner cases. An example is documented in Appendix A.2. In Internet usage of TCP, these conditions are rarely occurring. Common operating systems include different alternative mitigations, and the standard has not been updated yet to codify one of them. Also, there is no known best approach. Given the lack of practical relevance, the TCPM consensus is to describe these known problems, but not to change the TCP standards in 793bis. Again, these problems could be solved by future, dedicated, narrow-focused RFCs that would have to reach IETF consensus first. <br><br>3/ There are known deviations between mandatory-to-implement requirements in the TCP standard and some widely deployed implementations. An example are some details in Section 3.8.3, such as the numerical value in MUST-23. Those cases typically do not affect interoperability with other implementations. The TCPM working group has discussed whether to change the standard in such cases (e.g., downgrade MUST-23 to a SHOULD), but finally refrained from going down that road in 793bis, given the huge installed base with a very large variety of TCP implementations. Similar like in the previous cases, 793bis may get updated by narrow-focused RFCs.<br><br>There is one important exception to the decision not to include new guidance in 793bis. The exception is Section 3.8.2 "TCP Congestion Control". TCP congestion control was developed after publication of <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> and the state-of-the-art has evolved a lot as compared to <a href="/doc/rfc1122/">RFC 1122</a>. While there are numerous RFCs that specify TCP congestion control, there is no clear normative guidance on the required minimum in all TCP implementations that would be appropriate for 793bis. However, 793bis cannot just stay silent on congestion control. Given the lack of other applicable wording in existing standards, Section 3.8.2 includes new text and is therefore different to the rest of the document. Section 3.8.2 was comprehensively reviewed by the TCPM working group and in particular by TCP implementers. The section is short and straightforward, and the wording was chosen very carefully to reflect existing TCP standards and operational experience in the Internet. Also, given ongoing research, TCP congestion control will most likely further evolve in future. Section 3.8.2 enables such a further evolution while defining important base requirements.<br><br>Running code exists - in billions of devices across numerous TCP/IP stacks. Given the very limited scope of modifications in the 793bis document, all TCP implementations that are already compliant to the TCP standards before publication of 793bis should be compliant to 793bis as well.<br><br>The shepherd believes that the 793bis document has unanimous support from the entire TCPM working group.<br><br><br>3. Intellectual Property<br><br>The editor has stated that his direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document has already been disclosed, in conformance with BCPs 78 and 79. The editor is not aware of any IPR relevant for the base TCP protocol. Since 793bis does not change the TCP protocol, relevant IPR would have to be disclosed already for the existing RFCs included in 793bis.<br><br>There is a Cisco IPR disclosure from year 2004 related to the Internet-Draft that resulted in <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/</a>). <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> is one source of changes included in 793bis.

The document shepherd has verified on the TCPM mailing list that the TCPM working group is fine with the proposed text in 793bis related to <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a>. In the TCPM working group there are no known concerns regarding this IPR disclosure related to an optional mechanism.<br><br><br>4.

These are all false positives. The document refers to some obsolete documents to provide historical context.<br><br>The IANA section includes many actions:<br>(1) Update the structure of the TCP flags registry to include a new column called "Assignment Notes" <br>(2) Rename "Bit" column of the TCP flags registry to "Bit Offset"<br>(3) Update the TCP flags registry to include all assigned TCP flags, not only those initially assigned in <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>. 10-15 values are assigned. <br>(4) Move the existing TCP flags registry to be as sub-registry of the TCP registry.<br>There was unanimous consensus in TCPM with these changes. The modifications neither change any allocation nor any policy in the IANA registry. <br><br>All errata to <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> and related RFCs have been considered in this "bis" document.<br><br>When Wes started working on a 793bis document in 2013, the document shepherd, as well as many other TCPM contributors, were pretty convinced that writing a 793bis document is an impossible endeavor.

The section is short and straightforward, and the wording was chosen very carefully to reflect existing TCP standards and operational experience in the Internet. Also, given ongoing research, TCP congestion control will most likely further evolve in future. Section 3.8.2 enables such a further evolution while defining important base requirements.<br><br>Running code exists - in billions of devices across numerous TCP/IP stacks. Given the very limited scope of modifications in the 793bis document, all TCP implementations that are already compliant to the TCP standards before publication of 793bis should be compliant to 793bis as well.<br><br>The shepherd believes that the 793bis document has unanimous support from the entire TCPM working group.<br><br><br>3. Intellectual Property<br><br>The editor has stated that his direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document has already been disclosed, in conformance with BCPs 78 and 79. The editor is not aware of any IPR relevant for the base TCP protocol. Since 793bis does not change the TCP protocol, relevant IPR would have to be disclosed already for the existing RFCs included in 793bis.<br><br>There is a Cisco IPR disclosure from year 2004 related to the Internet-Draft that resulted in <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/</a>). <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> is one source of changes included in 793bis. In all places in 793bis where the recommendations from <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> are mentioned, 5961 is prominently referenced. <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> mostly affects MAY-12 in 793bis, i.e., the changes described in <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a> are optional and not mandatory-to-implement.<br><br>It has been suggested that the owner of the IPR disclosed in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/421/</a> updates the IPR disclosure to make clear whether it applies to 793bis, or not.<br><br>The TCPM working group is aware of the IPR disclosure related to <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a>, which is known already for a long time. The document shepherd has verified on the TCPM mailing list that the TCPM working group is fine with the proposed text in 793bis related to <a href="/doc/rfc5961/">RFC 5961</a>. In the TCPM working group there are no known concerns regarding this IPR disclosure related to an optional mechanism.<br><br><br>4. Other Points<br><br>The intended status listed in the document is "Proposed Standard". As all main TCP implementations are supposed to comply with 793bis, the document may fulfill the requirements of an "Internet Standard" according to <a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc7127/">RFC 7127</a>. <br><br>idnits reports some warnings, such as obsolete references. These are all false positives. The document refers to some obsolete documents to provide historical context.<br><br>The IANA section includes many actions:<br>(1) Update the structure of the TCP flags registry to include a new column called "Assignment Notes" <br>(2) Rename "Bit" column of the TCP flags registry to "Bit Offset"<br>(3) Update the TCP flags registry to include all assigned TCP flags, not only those initially assigned in <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">RFC 3168</a>. 10-15 values are assigned. <br>(4) Move the existing TCP flags registry to be as sub-registry of the TCP registry.<br>There was unanimous consensus in TCPM with these changes. The modifications neither change any allocation nor any policy in the IANA registry. <br><br>All errata to <a href="/doc/rfc793/">RFC 793</a> and related RFCs have been considered in this "bis" document.<br><br>When Wes started working on a 793bis document in 2013, the document shepherd, as well as many other TCPM contributors, were pretty convinced that writing a 793bis document is an impossible endeavor. Well, after many years, we are proven wrong. Many thanks to Wes as editor!<br></div></td>
