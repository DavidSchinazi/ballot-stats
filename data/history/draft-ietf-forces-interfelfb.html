While you may not be changing<br>the protocol much, you are sending PDUs over a network where they<br>previously were processed within one machine. IIRC, earlier ForCES<br>documents called for IPSec or TLS as mandatory-to-implement (MTI)<br>for anything where ForCES stuff was being sent "off the box." That<br>is clearly being done here, so I don't get how MACsec is now<br>regarded as optional to implement. Can you explain? That may be me<br>recalling incorrectly, or perhaps there is a good reason, but if the<br>above logic were correct there would have been no reason to have<br>said earlier that security was MTI so I'm confused.<br><br>(2) I'm also unsure that just saying "use MACsec" is enough to get<br>interop and security for this. For example, is it likely that<br>separate keys would be setup just for ForCES use here?&nbsp; If so,<br>saying that's needed would be good. If not, I wonder what threats<br>might arise with spoofing ForCES traffic from a box that has the<br>right MACsec keys. Has someone implemented/tested with MACsec and<br>considered those issues?</div></td>

There were discussion between a<br>couple of members of the working group, but all issues have been addressed<br>prior to this document being accepted as a working group document without any consensus issues.<br>At least one implementation has validated the features described in the document.&nbsp; <br>There were no issues reported during the last call and therefore we believe the<br>working group is solidly behind this document. <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; There is at least one implementation that has validated the features described<br>&nbsp; in the document. At least one vendor has implemented the specification.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Evangelos Haleplidis and the Responsible Area Director<br>&nbsp; is Alia Atlas.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>This document is ready for publication. <br>The author addressed all of the comments as well as incorporated satisfactory David Black's suggestions for congestion control.<br>There are minor nits that can be fixed during the RFC editor phase. There are also two notes for the editor. Both notes refer to the Ethertype value which should be given with the acceptance of this document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>No. The document has been reviewed, commented and revised several times. <br>In addition it has undergone further review from congestion control experts, the AD, the routing directorate and the Gen-ART reviewer.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No. The XML has been verified by the schema both by software as well as by ForCES model experts.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no concerns.<br>Regarding the congestion control applicability section, the authors have satisfactory defined the applicability of this document to belong strictly to Controlled Environment as per draft-ietf-tsvwg-rfc5405bis-10. In addition the authors have provided suggestions to mitigate potential issues with congestion traffic due to UDP usage.<br>"the Inter-FE LFB MUST only be deployed within a single<br>&nbsp;  network (with a single network operator) or networks of an adjacent<br>&nbsp;  set of cooperating network operators where traffic is managed to<br>&nbsp;  avoid congestion"<br>Both the AD and the Gen-ART reviewer made a notice about the Ethertype which was resolved using the proper IETF process for ethertypes within the text.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>The authors have confirmed that there is no IPR disclosures.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>While the WG no longer exists, before the shutting down of the WG, the WG was solidly behind the document. <br>The document was reviewed and there were some discussions at the early stages of the document, which were addressed.<br>At the first Last Call, there was no issues reported, therefore it is the Shepherd's view<br>that the whole WG understood and agreed on the document.<br><br>The document underwent a second IETF last call after the wg was closed. Some editorial changes were requested by Alia Atlas (AD) and Russ Housely (Gen-Art reviewer), which will be address by the author prior to proceeding for publication.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.
