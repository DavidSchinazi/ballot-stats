Let's engage in the discussion.<br><br>Status of the draft: Not ready (publication wise), Almost ready (technical basis)<br><br>Overall comment: First of all, as a long-term supporter of the OLSR work I am very happy to see this experimental draft that seeks to provide clear proof points of the MT-OLSR-v2 work.&nbsp; I believe the MT-OLSR-v2 can provide substantial benefit in the industry.&nbsp;  My comments should be taken as a way to help the experiment provide real data points to IETF and to the industry on the successful.&nbsp; Real data will help the long term debate over the ADOV-v2 and OLSR-v2 work.&nbsp; Almost 10 years ago Don Fedyk show me some very limited theoretical analysis on where early version of these protocol fit within 802.11s work.&nbsp; Experimental work is critical to expansion of this work as new 802.11 and new mobile radios continue to make MANET’s work relevant for future networks.<br><br> <br><br>Summary of Comments:<br><br>My comments have 6 major issues, and a set of editorial changes.&nbsp; Five of my major points have to do with adding more details to the draft to judge the experiment valuable.&nbsp; One way to resolve these comments is to create document providing details on the test that will be run.&nbsp; A second way to resolve these comments on experiment is to provide additional high-level guidance in this document.<br><br> <br><br>The 6th major technical point is that you have not done the IANA Section to match previous RFCs (7181, 7188).&nbsp; I believe Barry Lieba and IANA have already noted this issue as well.&nbsp;  The format of the IANA section should be changed to include all the IANA registration issues.<br><br> <br><br>I have other editorial comments but since I have indicated a substantial section re-write due to major comments, I will be glad to review the document for final editorial comments in a second pass.&nbsp; <br><br> <br><br>Technical summary: Basically – it is a good extension of existing work.&nbsp; It is useful for Wireless and MANET for mobile. The authors did a good job of focusing on just the revisions.&nbsp; However, I am recommending more detail on the experiments will help the protocol and help to create knobs for configuration and management of the protocol.<br><br> <br><br>Here are the main points of the review:<br><br> <br><br>Status: Almost ready, but has 5 major points that will help define the experiment as a success.<br><br>1 Major point about the IANA Section.<br><br> <br><br>Major 1 issues are the exact definition of the tests that make it a successful experiment.&nbsp;  (p. 7, section 4, section 5, parameters<br><br>This draft needs to have the clarity of setting expectations for if the experiments succeeds.&nbsp; The recommended tests in major concern 1-4 could be created in a separate draft.&nbsp;  If so, this draft should reference that draft.<br><br> <br><br>A few things that should be in the tests are:<br><br> <br><br>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Topologies that prove the OLSR-v2 and MT-OLSR “doesn’t break” either protocol.&nbsp; As previous tests of link-state protocols have shown, it is the topologies and the changes between the topologies that cause failures.&nbsp; Changes to topologies include migrating between topologies due to link failures or link flapping.&nbsp; In the OLSR-v2 and MT-OLSR world this is extremely important as mobile nodes may have radios or Wifi that fades in and out. <br><br> <br><br>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scaling tests – what happens if the arrays round out of space?&nbsp; Does the route calculation for each metric type cause problems?<br><br>Are there efficiencies that some implementations use to improve scaling?<br><br> <br><br>3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interoperability tests with the previous versions OSLR-v2 (can you crash an older OLSR-V2 version)?&nbsp; These tests should be not just two boxes but topologies of nodes connected by Wifi (802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11k (if ready)) and other mobile radios (software defined radios, military, and others).<br><br> <br><br>4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Failure tests/Error conditions (section 5) – E.g. what happens parameter arrays have repetitions in the IFACE_METRIC_TYPES. What happens if the ordering of the LINK_METRIC_TYPE.metric type does not include the ROUTER_METRIC_TYPE First?<br><br> <br><br>Other tests should be described.&nbsp; All these tests should have topologies, parameters, and results.&nbsp; OSLR-2 tests should pick up the theory from the benchmarking WG for testing OSPF and ISIS depends on the types of topologies that are given.&nbsp; For other authors, I would give more precise details.&nbsp; However, due to the expertise of the two authors – I gave just this high level guidance.&nbsp; I will be glad to work through scenarios with the authors.<br><br> <br><br>Major 2: Should the be a negotiation of resources sizing or just an overload bit flag when it fails?<br><br> <br><br>We know that overload bits have problems.&nbsp; So, does this experiment try to fix this in the MT-OLSR2?&nbsp; If not, as it goes to from scalar to arrays – how will peers know when it fails in one MT-Topology versus another?&nbsp; Is this experiment restricted to fate-sharing among the MT-OLSR-v2 topologies due to resources on a single?&nbsp; Should the negotiation of the types in the Hello have a resource constraint in the MPR-WILLING TLV?&nbsp; This negotiation for MT-OLSRv2 is different than the simple upgrade from OLSR to OLSRv2.&nbsp; It is important to know how the overload works in MT-OLSR-v2 only, and combined MT-OLSRv2 and OLSR-v2.&nbsp; This overload should be tested in a variety of topologies with parameters, topologies, and routing flow carefully detailed. Again, see the benchmarking drafts on OSPF and ISIS.<br><br> <br><br>Again, what I pose is questions that I feel the authors should consider in an experiment for this type of work.&nbsp; These expert authors have the capability to place additional high-level in this document (or more detail in a different document).&nbsp; Again, I will gladly provide the authors with feedback and review<br><br> <br><br>Major 3:&nbsp; It is not clear that the experiment is consider whether the MPR calculation per TE-metric will consume significant resources.<br><br>A good benchmarking (see Major 1) would be useful.&nbsp; The theoretical assurance that:<br><br> <br><br>“Each router may make its own decision as to whether or not to use a<br><br>link metric, or link metrics, for flooding MPR calculation, and if so<br><br>which and how. This decision MUST be made in a manner that ensures<br><br>that flooded messages will reach the same symmetric 2-hop neighbors<br><br>as would be the case for a router not supporting MT-OLSRv2 (section 10, paragraph)<br><br> <br><br>Is not really strongly there. If this is experimental, it is important to test this point in the benchmarking.&nbsp; I do not really see it in the experiment.&nbsp; This applies to the 1-hop neighbors (both those not considered (symmetric links)) and those considered in the 2-hop consideration.<br><br> <br><br>The experiment should again set benchmarks for success on the MPR calculation for MT-OLSR-v2, and combined MT-OLSR-v2 and OLSR-v2 which contain several topologies, careful parameter setting, and methods to record convergence time. <br><br> <br><br>Major comment 4:&nbsp; The link between NHDP and this standard’s experiment with MPR is not clear.<br><br> <br><br>I expected some comment on how NHDP interacts with the MPR Tests above.&nbsp; This may simply be a revision of the text for the use case for MPR calculation.&nbsp; I expected some comment because&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7466/">RFC 7466</a> states in its abstract:<br><br>&nbsp;  Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop<br><br>&nbsp;  neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is<br><br>&nbsp;  below an acceptable threshold while still retaining the corresponding<br><br>&nbsp;  link information as acquired from the HELLO message exchange.&nbsp; This<br><br>&nbsp;  allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link<br><br>&nbsp;  quality later improves sufficiently.<br><br> <br><br>&nbsp;  NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.<br><br>&nbsp;  However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor<br><br>&nbsp;  ceases being symmetric, including while "ignored" (as described<br><br>&nbsp;  above), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.<br><br>&nbsp;  This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being<br><br>&nbsp;  permanently removed (until further HELLO message received) if<br><br>&nbsp;  the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the<br><br>&nbsp;  acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.&nbsp; <br><br> <br><br>Major concern 5:&nbsp; Experiments should drive to create operational guidelines for deployment, configuration knobs, and use cases (ADOV-2, OLSR-v2, MT-OLSR-v2)<br><br> <br><br>While all these major issues are not directly operations, early experiments will help the operations people to set the management variables in section 10:&nbsp; <br><br>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reasonable TE metrics,<br><br>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Detecting that MANET is sufficiently connected,<br><br>3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Providing guidance to deployments on performance of route sets for diff-serv in different environments (Wifi and other mobile radio nodes),<br><br>4)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Determine how the mixture of OLSR-v2 and MT-OLSR-v2 work in different environments.<br><br>5)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Determine how to design for OLSR-v2 and MT-OLSR-v2 networks for better MPR assignment with NHDP&nbsp; <br><br> <br><br>Major 6: The IANA section does not answer all the IANA questions. <br><br>It has most of the information, but I think it is not up to the latest IANA format and information.&nbsp;  Barry Leiba and others have noted that the <a href="/doc/rfc7181/">RFC 7181</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc7188/">RFC7188</a> do not match this IANA section.&nbsp; Rather than repeat these comments, I will simple state the data needs to be consistent and the format match IANA’s comments.</div></td>

They need to hear:<br>- go to registry named foo<br>- go to sub-registry named bar<br>- make the following change to the registry...<br><br>Everything else is a distraction to them and needs to come out of the<br>document completely or be moved to another section.<br><br>- - - <br><br>But first, two meta questions:<br><br>1. In some of the sub-registries where you are assigning new Type <br>&nbsp;  Extensions, there is already scope for "Experimental Use."&nbsp; Why do<br>&nbsp;  you feel the need to have Expert Review assignments rather than using<br>&nbsp;  experimental values (the latter would not have their values recorded<br>&nbsp;  against this RFC nor have the values recorded in this RFC)?<br><br>&nbsp;  I should add here that you *are* allowed to have Expert Review <br>&nbsp;  assignments for Experimental RFCs (if the experts so agree).<br><br>2. I am fixing (on this week's IESG telechat) the fact that many of <br>&nbsp;  these sub-registries are missing their Designated Experts. That's a<br>&nbsp;  formality, and the WG chairs can stand in these roles.<br><br>&nbsp;  However, I suspect that the DEs have not explicitly made clear that<br>&nbsp;  they are OK with the assignments in this document. That's OK, but I<br>&nbsp;  just need to know (normally in the Shepherd write-up) and to let you<br>&nbsp;  know that IANA will ping the DEs at some point to get them to sign<br>&nbsp;  off, so making sure that they are happy in advance is a good way to<br>&nbsp;  avoid surprises.<br><br>&nbsp;  (The guidance to DEs in 5444/6.1 seems very clear.)<br><br>- - -<br><br>Section 13.1 as far as I can tell does not change the guidelines to the<br>Designated Experts that have already been established. So I think you <br>can safely delete this section. In particular, this section does not <br>give IANA any information.<br><br>- - -<br><br>Section 13.2<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; This specification replaces Table 11 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7181/">RFC7181</a>].<br><br>This reads like you are Updating 7181 (i.e. changing that specification).<br>I don't believe that is your intention<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br>&gt;&nbsp; That specified a<br>&gt;&nbsp; Message MPR Type described as MPR_WILLING, for which only Type<br>&gt;&nbsp; Extension 0 was defined.&nbsp; This specification reserves that name<br>&gt;&nbsp; MPR_WILLING for Type Extension 0,<br><br>I think you mean "retains". "Reserve" has a specific IANA meaning of<br>"not available for use".<br><br>However, it appears that you are updating the text for the MPR_WILLING/0<br>value in the "MPR_WILLING Message Type Extensions" sub-registry found at<br><a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/manet-parameters.xhtml#mpr-willing-message-type-extension">https://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/manet-parameters.xhtml#mpr-willing-message-type-extension</a><br><br>This you observe in the next sentence where you say:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; It also changes the Value field<br>&gt;&nbsp; specification of the MPR_WILLING TLV.<br><br>You need to show IANA the old text and the new text. I think that the <br>text in your Table 2 may be useful to retain in this document (in <br>another section) but is too much text for IANA to include in their<br>registry.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; defines a new Type Extension 1, with a new name MPR_TYPES,<br><br>I don't think you can do this!<br>Type 7 is already entirely known as MPR_WILLING (see the "Message TLV <br>Types" sub-registry).<br><br>So your choice here is to use a new Message TLV or to retain the same<br>name for the new Type Extension.<br><br>As far as IANA is concerned, you need to tell them:<br>- in which sub-registry to include Type Extension 1<br>- what text to include with it<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; and leaves the remaining Type Extensions<br>&gt;&nbsp; of this TLV Type unnamed. <br><br>"Unnamed"? Maybe you mean "Unassigned"?<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Specifications of these TLVs are in Table 2.&nbsp; Each of these TLVs MUST<br>&gt;&nbsp; NOT be included more than once in a Message TLV Block.<br><br>I don't think that IANA needs to see this table, and certainly doesn't<br>need to know about the protocol rules.<br><br>- - -<br><br>Section 13.3<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Table 16 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7181/">RFC7181</a>] is replaced by Table 3.&nbsp; Note that the only<br>&gt;&nbsp; change is to the description of the Value field.<br><br>If you are replacing a table in 7181 then you are updating 7181. But is<br>that what this draft is doing?<br><br>Anyway, I don't think IANA is interested in this point. They want to <br>know what changes to make to the "GATEWAY Address Block TLV Type <br>Extensions" sub-registry at<br><a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/manet-parameters.xhtml#gateway-address-block-tlv-type-extension">https://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/manet-parameters.xhtml#gateway-address-block-tlv-type-extension</a><br><br>Again, just old and new text.<br><br>If you want to include Table 3 in this document, then please put it<br>outside this section.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Table 13 of [<a href="/doc/rfc7181/">RFC7181</a>] is replaced by Table 4.&nbsp; Note that the only<br>&gt;&nbsp; change is to allocate 8 Type Extensions as assigned by administrative<br>&gt;&nbsp; action, in order to support administratively determined multi-<br>&gt;&nbsp; topologies.<br><br>Pretty much exactly the same considerations.<br><br>- - -<br><br>If you can answer all this quickly, I can go ahead with the rest of my<br>review. I suspect that the answers will need a revised I-D, but we can <br>batch that with the rest of my review once I know what the answers are.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Adrian</div></td>
