It was and is badly needed, and <br>as noted, roaming, network access authentication, and the use of <br>NAIs is growing and there is an obvious need to make sure <br>internationalised identifiers in particular work correctly. And as we <br>understand now, <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC 4282</a> indeed didn't provide a satisfactory <br>answer on that issue.<br><br>However, I have a couple observations of the text in the comment<br>section and one question that I would like to discuss before<br>recommending an approval of this draft.<br><br>The question:<br><br>I noticed the change from 4282 in terms of the bang syntax. This<br>isn't my favourite syntax, but conditions for its use were specified<br>in 4282. As far as I can see, the same conditions still exist in the<br>draft, but the draft adds that the usage is NOT RECOMMENDED,<br>and adds some rationale for this. Stating that the usage is<br>historical. The draft also removes the processing rules from<br>what they were in 4282:<br><br>&nbsp;  In this case, the part before the (non-escaped) '!'&nbsp; MUST be a realm<br>&nbsp;  name as defined in the ABNF in Section 2.1.&nbsp; This realm name is an<br>&nbsp;  "IDN-unaware domain name slot", just like the realm name after the<br>&nbsp;  "@" character; see Section 2.4 for details.&nbsp; When receiving such an<br>&nbsp;  NAI, the other realm MUST convert the format back to<br>&nbsp;  "<a href="mailto:user@homerealm.example.net">user@homerealm.example.net</a>" when passing the NAI forward, as well as<br>&nbsp;  applying appropriate AAA routing for the transaction.<br><br>I have two questions related to this.<br><br>First, has the WG been aware of existing, not historical usage, <br>of this syntax? Quick search reveals that 3GPP networks use<br>a routing convention with the syntax, see<br><a href="http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23003.htm">http://www.3gpp.org/DynaReport/23003.htm</a> and<br><a href="http://www.qtc.jp/3GPP/Specs/24302-a70.pdf">http://www.qtc.jp/3GPP/Specs/24302-a70.pdf</a> (note that I'm not<br>the expert on these types of usage and there might be additional<br>examples, or the experts might understand the situation better<br>than what we can gain merely by looking at the existing specs).<br><br>Also, <a href="/doc/rfc5729/">RFC 5729</a> discusses the use of decorated NAIs in<br>Diameter context.<br><br>In any case, I think the WG should be aware of existing realities<br>of deployed usage.<br><br>Secondly, does that usage change any of your recommendations?<br>Perhaps one could argue that when you understand your<br>situation and have good justification, you can go against a SHOULD <br>or RECOMMEND. Or perhaps one could argue that specific<br>conventions (such as the 3GPP usage) where the routing<br>table distribution is not an issue are safe. And finally, it seems<br>that deprecating processing rules (regardless of the recommendation<br>about general use of decoration) seems problematic if there are<br>existing systems that rely on this.<br><br>Thoughts?</div></td>

Recent examples can be <br>found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval <br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is<br>&nbsp;  necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to<br>&nbsp;  identify each other's users.&nbsp; This document defines the syntax for<br>&nbsp;  the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by<br>&nbsp;  the client prior to accessing resources. This document is a revised<br>&nbsp;  version of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC 4282</a>, which addresses issues with international<br>&nbsp;  character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the<br>&nbsp;  previous document.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The preceding <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> was primarily written for the concrete use case of network <br>access. Over time however, many services made use of the concept defined therein; <br>see Citation information at <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html">http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html</a> for <br>a complete list of IETF work; other standardization bodies or other documents not <br>counted.<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> thus had to make modest modifications in order not to create <br>incompatibilities with these existing uses. It also took care to define the NAI in a <br>protocol-agnostic manner to encourage such re-use.<br><br>One particular issue which was discussed at length was the question: which entity <br>should (be allowed to) normalise or re-encode the realm portions of NAIs; and what to <br>do if such a re-encoding is needed, but not possible. In the core scenario of network <br>access, i.e use with RADIUS and Diameter, character encoding and normalisation <br>information may not be available to any RADIUS/Diameter endpoint at all (the encoding <br>information may get lost at a preceding stage, before the NAI reaches the RADIUS <br>client). In other scenarios, the encoding information may be available at all points in the<br>conversation. The working group finally converged on the text in section 2.6, which <br>puts a bias on endpoints doing all conversions, and intermediate entities doing <br>conversions only inside their local state; not modifying the NAI on the wire.<br><br>Another aspect that was discussed is that the notion of User-Name in AAA protocols <br>and the term NAI are not an exact match; while User-Name often is used to transmit a <br>NAI, it can also be used to transmit arbitrary strings which do not follow the NAI <br>conventions of either <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> or draft-ietf-radext-nai. The working group concluded <br>that this is a fact of life that can't be changed, and that implementations which inspect a <br>User-Name can't blindly assume to get a NAI; they need to care about their own <br>fallback/failure handling. Such handling is outside the scope of draft-ietf-radext-nai.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The concept of NAIs is not new, and the definitions of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are <br>compatible with implementations of NAIs in the "ASCII" subset. Field evidence <br>suggests that <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>'s provisions for dealing with characters from outside ASCII <br>were with an overwhelming majority not implemented at all or even violated <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> <br>and did what <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> is now suggesting anyway; so existing <br>implementations do not conflict with the new encoding rules parts that are introduced with draft-ietf-radext-nai. It's thus a reasonable assumption that NAIs as defined in<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are as widely implemented as the NAIs of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>.<br><br>The encoding and normalisation questions triggered an i18n review; the person doing <br>that review was Pete Resnick . The review comments <br>were one of the inputs to the discussion and were taken into account in the latest <br>revision of the draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Stefan Winter . <br>The responsible area directors of the Operations and Management area are Benoit Claise &lt;​<a href="mailto:bclaise@cisco.com">bclaise@cisco.com</a>&gt; and Joel Jaeggli &lt;​<a href="mailto:joelja@bogus.com">joelja@bogus.com</a>&gt;.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I was active in the discussion of the draft throughout its lifetime (at the time not being a <br>co-chair but a working group participant). I have read all revisions of the draft and have <br>given the revision which was originally put forward for PROTO Write-up (-05) another <br>thorough read. I found some minor issues, which were subsequently resolved in the<br>current -08. The document is now ready for publication.<br><br>(There is still a minor wordsmithing glitch which is being tracked in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176">http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176</a> ; it will be fixed with the IETF Last Call comments or during the publication process )<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>This draft has gotten significant exposure; it was commented on by many working <br>group members and also experts from outside the working group. I have no concerns <br>about the breadth and depth of the review process.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>Internationalisation is the big topic of this follow-up to <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>; it introduces new ways <br>of handling internationalisation and puts recommendations on end systems. The end <br>systems need to make sure user input from UI or configuration items are in UTF-8 or <br>will be converted to UTF-8 before sending them on the wire; they should also perform <br>normalisation. The internationalisation review by Pete Resnick was called for in an <br>ad-hoc, informal manner by a WG participant, and was for an earlier revision of the <br>draft (-02). It might be useful to flag the document in its current state to i18n experts <br>again for a thorough review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The big items of discussion were outlined earlier in the write-up. There is no perfect <br>way to define NAI, normalisation, and encoding in the complex multi-protocol usage <br>that is the deployed reality. The working group reached a consensus which appears to <br>be the most useful way of dealing with the topics in question. I thus have no concerns <br>with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>There is only one author, and he has submitted the draft with the pre-2008 boiler plate <br>text. There are large passages of text pulled-in from <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> and other documents, <br>which could not be worked around; nor did the original authors agree on changing the <br>IPR. This justifies the pre-2008 boilerplate.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There are no known IPR disclosures surrounding this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?

I believe the WG<br>as a whole stands behind this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>There were no threats of appeal. There was friction in the contentious points I <br>mentioned earlier in the write-up, but in the absence of a perfect solution, the document <br>as-is found support by a high majority of participants.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

This document is a revised<br>&nbsp;  version of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC 4282</a>, which addresses issues with international<br>&nbsp;  character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the<br>&nbsp;  previous document.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The preceding <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> was primarily written for the concrete use case of network <br>access. Over time however, many services made use of the concept defined therein; <br>see Citation information at <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html">http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html</a> for <br>a complete list of IETF work; other standardization bodies or other documents not <br>counted.<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> thus had to make modest modifications in order not to create <br>incompatibilities with these existing uses. It also took care to define the NAI in a <br>protocol-agnostic manner to encourage such re-use.<br><br>One particular issue which was discussed at length was the question: which entity <br>should (be allowed to) normalise or re-encode the realm portions of NAIs; and what to <br>do if such a re-encoding is needed, but not possible. In the core scenario of network <br>access, i.e use with RADIUS and Diameter, character encoding and normalisation <br>information may not be available to any RADIUS/Diameter endpoint at all (the encoding information may get lost at a preceding stage, before the NAI reaches the RADIUS <br>client). In other scenarios, the encoding information may be available at all points in the<br>conversation. The working group finally converged on the text in section 2.6, which <br>puts a bias on endpoints doing all conversions, and intermediate entities doing <br>conversions only inside their local state; not modifying the NAI on the wire.<br><br>Another aspect that was discussed is that the notion of User-Name in AAA protocols <br>and the term NAI are not an exact match; while User-Name often is used to transmit a <br>NAI, it can also be used to transmit arbitrary strings which do not follow the NAI <br>conventions of either <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> or draft-ietf-radext-nai. The working group concluded <br>that this is a fact of life that can't be changed, and that implementations which inspect a <br>User-Name can't blindly assume to get a NAI; they need to care about their own <br>fallback/failure handling. Such handling is outside the scope of draft-ietf-radext-nai.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The concept of NAIs is not new, and the definitions of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are <br>compatible with implementations of NAIs in the "ASCII" subset. Field evidence <br>suggests that <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>'s provisions for dealing with characters from outside ASCII <br>were with an overwhelming majority not implemented at all or even violated <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> <br>and did what <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> is now suggesting anyway; so existing <br>implementations do not conflict with the new encoding rules parts that are introduced with draft-ietf-radext-nai. It's thus a reasonable assumption that NAIs as defined in<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are as widely implemented as the NAIs of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>.<br><br>The encoding and normalisation questions triggered an i18n review; the person doing <br>that review was Pete Resnick .

I have no concerns <br>about the breadth and depth of the review process.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>Internationalisation is the big topic of this follow-up to <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>; it introduces new ways <br>of handling internationalisation and puts recommendations on end systems. The end <br>systems need to make sure user input from UI or configuration items are in UTF-8 or <br>will be converted to UTF-8 before sending them on the wire; they should also perform <br>normalisation. The internationalisation review by Pete Resnick was called for in an <br>ad-hoc, informal manner by a WG participant, and was for an earlier revision of the <br>draft (-02). It might be useful to flag the document in its current state to i18n experts <br>again for a thorough review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The big items of discussion were outlined earlier in the write-up. There is no perfect <br>way to define NAI, normalisation, and encoding in the complex multi-protocol usage <br>that is the deployed reality.

The<br>category is indicated in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is<br>&nbsp;  necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to<br>&nbsp;  identify each other's users.&nbsp; This document defines the syntax for<br>&nbsp;  the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by<br>&nbsp;  the client prior to accessing resources. This document is a revised<br>&nbsp;  version of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC 4282</a>, which addresses issues with international<br>&nbsp;  character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the<br>&nbsp;  previous document.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The preceding <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> was primarily written for the concrete use case of network access. Over time however, many services made use of the concept defined therein; see Citation information at <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html">http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html</a> for a complete list of IETF work; other standardization bodies or other documents not counted.<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> thus had to make modest modifications in order not to create incompatibilities with these existing uses. It also took care to define the NAI in a protocol-agnostic manner to encourage such re-use.<br><br>One particular issue which was discussed at length was the question: which entity should (be allowed to) normalise or re-encode the realm portions of NAIs; and what to do if such a re-encoding is needed, but not possible. In the core scenario of network access, i.e use with RADIUS and Diameter, character encoding and normalisation information may not be available to any RADIUS/Diameter endpoint at all (the encoding information may get lost at a preceding stage, before the NAI reaches the RADIUS client). In other scenarios, the encoding information may be available at all points in the conversation. The working group finally converged on the text in section 2.6, which puts a bias on endpoints doing all conversions, and intermediate entities doing conversions only inside their local state; not modifying the NAI on the wire.<br><br>Another aspect that was discussed is that the notion of User-Name in AAA protocols and the term NAI are not an exact match; while User-Name often is used to transmit a NAI, it can also be used to transmit arbitrary strings which do not follow the NAI conventions of either <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> or draft-ietf-radext-nai. The working group concluded that this is a fact of life that can't be changed, and that implementations which inspect a User-Name can't blindly assume to get a NAI; they need to care about their own fallback/failure handling. Such handling is outside the scope of draft-ietf-radext-nai.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The concept of NAIs is not new, and the definitions of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are compatible with implementations of NAIs in the "ASCII" subset. Field evidence suggests that <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>'s provisions for dealing with characters from outside ASCII were with an overwhelming majority not implemented at all or even violated <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> and did what <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> is now suggesting anyway; so existing implementations do not conflict with the new encoding rules parts that are introduced with draft-ietf-radext-nai. It's thus a reasonable assumption that NAIs as defined in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are as widely implemented as the NAIs of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>.<br><br>The encoding and normalisation questions triggered an i18n review; the person doing that review was Pete Resnick . The review comments were one of the inputs to the discussion and were taken into account in the latest revision of the draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Stefan Winter . The responsible area directors of the Operations and Management area are Benoit Claise &lt;​<a href="mailto:bclaise@cisco.com">bclaise@cisco.com</a>&gt; and Joel Jaeggli &lt;​<a href="mailto:joelja@bogus.com">joelja@bogus.com</a>&gt;.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I was active in the discussion of the draft throughout its lifetime (at the time not being a co-chair but a working group participant). I have read all revisions of the draft and have given the revision which was originally put forward for PROTO Write-up (-05) another thorough read. I found some minor issues, which were subsequently resolved in the current -08. The document is now ready for publication.<br><br>(There is still a minor wordsmithing glitch which is being tracked in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176">http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176</a> ; it will be fixed with the IETF Last Call comments or during the publication process )<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>This draft has gotten significant exposure; it was commented on by many working group members and also experts from outside the working group. I have no concerns about the breadth and depth of the review process.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>Internationalisation is the big topic of this follow-up to <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>; it introduces new ways of handling internationalisation and puts recommendations on end systems. The end systems need to make sure user input from UI or configuration items are in UTF-8 or will be converted to UTF-8 before sending them on the wire; they should also perform normalisation. The internationalisation review by Pete Resnick was called for in an ad-hoc, informal manner by a WG participant, and was for an earlier revision of the draft (-02). It might be useful to flag the document in its current state to i18n experts again for a thorough review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The big items of discussion were outlined earlier in the write-up. There is no perfect way to define NAI, normalisation, and encoding in the complex multi-protocol usage that is the deployed reality. The working group reached a consensus which appears to be the most useful way of dealing with the topics in question. I thus have no concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>There is only one author, and he has submitted the draft with the pre-2008 boiler plate text. There are large passages of text pulled-in from <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> and other documents, which could not be worked around; nor did the original authors agree on changing the IPR. This justifies the pre-2008 boilerplate.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There are no known IPR disclosures surrounding this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The number of people who discussed this draft is comparatively high. I believe the WG as a whole stands behind this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>There were no threats of appeal. There was friction in the contentious points I mentioned earlier in the write-up, but in the absence of a perfect solution, the document as-is found support by a high majority of participants.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>-- Obsolete informational reference (is this intentional?): <a href="/doc/rfc5335/">RFC 5335</a><br><br>After checking back with the author, this obsolete reference *is* intentional. The RFC contains an ABNF production for email headers which the current document refers to; the successor to <a href="/doc/rfc5335/">RFC5335</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc6532/">RFC6532</a>) does not contain that ABNF any more.<br><br>The document contains a non-ASCII example. That's not a nit, but raises the question if this document should be published as UTF-8 text. It would certainly help readability.<br><br>It occured to me that the normative reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5234/">RFC5234</a> does not mention that this RFC is also <a href="/doc/std68/">STD68</a>. I don't know if this is something the author has to fix (references are usually auto-generated and add the "STDxy" if appropriate; wondering why that didn't happen here).<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The document did not have to go through MIB Doctor, Media Type, nor URI type reviews because it does not assign any of these.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All normative references are issued RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>The references to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc6365/">RFC6365</a> are BCPs. I do not believe that to be problematic though.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>. This is reflected in the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction (section 1.4).<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> had an extensive section called IANA Considerations but which had no actual actions for IANA. The text has now been moved to its own section; and the IANA Considerations are empty. This is the intended state.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>There are no new IANA registries created by this document.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>I read and reviewed the BNFs, but did not verify them with an automated parser.</div></td>

Are the results of the normalisation only used locally, such<br>as for routing? Or is the normalised result somehow passed onwards (such<br>as when passing the RADIUS request to the next entity)?

In 2.4<br>you say that the username can be omitted or be<br>anonymous and that other protocols can support that<br>which is fine. But shouldn't you also consider that<br>sometimes (parts of) the realm part might also be<br>sensitive and handled similarly? E.g. if the "real" NAI<br>was "<a href="mailto:joebloggs@sensitive.example.org">joebloggs@sensitive.example.org</a>" then (assuming<br><a href="http://example.org">example.org</a> is sufficient for routing) wouldn't it be<br>nice if "@example.org" or "@anonymous.example.org"<br>could be sent as the visible NAI with the full NAI<br>being protected elsewhere in the protocol? For example<br>replacing the string sensitive in that NAI with the<br>name of a disease or counselling service might be a<br>real use case. Did the WG discuss this possibility?<br>(Note: I'm not trying to insist that this be done, I'd<br>just like to chat about it since it could be easy<br>enough to allow for here even recognising that it might<br>not be possible in some important use-cases if the<br>"protected" other protocol field is only expected to<br>contain the username part of the NAI.) <br><br>- I agree with Barry's discuss and Aliss's concerns and<br>would like to see the follow up discussion on that and<br>suspect that involving the WG in that discussion would<br>be good. Even if the document is perhaps not "pushing"<br>the idea of using the same identifier everywhere, I do<br>think that an analysis of the impacts of doing so, and<br>of how to usefully not do so, should be done, whether<br>or not all of that analysis output is needed in this<br>document.&nbsp; That is, I could buy the concept that the<br>WG might take on the task of analysing the consequences<br>of (not)reuse of NAIs in multiple contexts in a<br>separate document, if the WG would really do that in a<br>timely manner. And if the WG waned to do that, then<br>some simple qualifiers added here and there might <br>be sufficient to handle Barry and Alissa's points.<br><br>- Generally, I'd prefer if the term "identifier" was<br>used throughout, and the term "identity" was never<br>used, or only very carefully. The abstract does not do<br>that IMO. Other text seems pretty good though but<br>I didn't check fully.<br><br>- Intro: " We suggest that this re-use is good<br>practice." needs a qualifier to handle the privacy<br>issues. (Recommending the format is fine, which goes to<br>Alissa's discuss.)<br><br>- 1.3: Same point: "as there is no need to maintain<br>multiple identifiers for one user" needs a qualifier.<br><br>- 1.3, 2nd last sentence: do you mean sybil attacks<br>here or something else? If the former saying so would<br>be good (or adding a ref), if the latter can you tell<br>me what you mean?<br><br>- 2.4, last para: saying "is typically required" seems<br>a bit weak, I wonder why you cannot require that the<br>realm part be routable or some such?</div></td>

It does not specify the particular contents of the identifier for any specific protocol or usage, nor does it specify any semantic rules for the construction of such identifiers (e.g., "the same user should always use the same identifier").<br><br>However, the document repeatedly makes the case -- in sections 1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.7, 2.8 -- that "the NAI" (whether the actual identifier or the format, it's not clear) should be the universal identifier of choice for all situations and protocols, because it "simplifie[s] the management of credentials," allows other protocols to "leverage AAA for user authentication," removes the need to "maintain multiple identifiers for one user," etc. The claims in all of these sections seem to conflate a single user's use of the same identifier with a single user's use of the same identifier *format*. I thought what is being defined in this document is a format and nothing more.<br><br>I'm perfectly fine with encouraging the use of a standard format across protocols and applications (although I still don't see the need to repeat the same recommendation over and over again in the document). That has basically happened already in lots of places.<br><br>I'm not fine at all with a blanket recommendation to use a single identifier for the same user everywhere. The ability to authenticate to different services (and even to different networks!) using different identities is a fundamental building block for privacy on the Internet. The message from this document seems to be that we should erase that protection.<br><br>I note that although the stated motivation for this document relates to internationalization, pretty much all of the text recommending One Identifier to Rule Them All is new. So perhaps there were multiple motivations for this document update?<br><br>I could offer a bunch of detailed text suggestions, but first I'd like to understand what this document is actually trying to do, and whether the term "the NAI" is meant to refer to an identifier or an identifier format. <br><br>= Section 2.4 =<br>"Therefore, the utf8-username portion SHOULD be treated<br>&nbsp;  as opaque data when processed by nodes that are not a part of the<br>&nbsp;  authoritative domain (in the sense of Section 4) for that realm."<br><br>What does it mean to treat a cleartext username as opaque data? Should the nodes outside the realm not log these usernames, or not process them in any way?<br><br>"Omitting the username part is RECOMMENDED over using a fixed username<br>&nbsp;  part, such as "anonymous", since it provides an unambiguous way to<br>&nbsp;  determine whether the username is intended to uniquely identify a<br>&nbsp;  single user."<br><br>I don't understand why this is true, other than by convention. If I process a bunch of authentication transactions that use "@example.com" as the NAI, how am I supposed to know that each of those was intended to identify a single user? Is the usage of an NAI to authenticate a group of users discussed somewhere?<br><br>In general, I'm uncomfortable with the approach this document takes of making a few notes about how the username part could be constructed without providing a more thorough analysis of threats and mitigations related to identifiability, uniqueness and persistence. This also comes up with the example in Section 2.8, where uniqueness is discussed in the context of the example, but there is no generalized discussion about uniqueness in identifier construction. This might get back to my larger point above about format versus content -- if this document is just specifying a format, it probably shouldn't be commenting on the identifier content or the consequences of it (although being able to omit the username part is certainly a format issue).</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>The document is a Proposed Standard (Standards track). This is an appropriate choice because its purpose is to obsolete another RFC on standards track (<a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>). The category is indicated in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>In order to provide inter-domain authentication services, it is<br>&nbsp;  necessary to have a standardized method that domains can use to<br>&nbsp;  identify each other's users.&nbsp; This document defines the syntax for<br>&nbsp;  the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by<br>&nbsp;  the client prior to accessing resources. This document is a revised<br>&nbsp;  version of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC 4282</a>, which addresses issues with international<br>&nbsp;  character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the<br>&nbsp;  previous document.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The preceding <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> was primarily written for the concrete use case of network access. Over time however, many services made use of the concept defined therein; see Citation information at <a href="http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html">http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/citations-rfc4282.html</a> for a complete list of IETF work; other standardization bodies or other documents not counted.<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> thus had to make modest modifications in order not to create incompatibilities with these existing uses. It also took care to define the NAI in a protocol-agnostic manner to encourage such re-use.<br><br>One particular issue which was discussed at length was the question: which entity should (be allowed to) normalise or re-encode the realm portions of NAIs; and what to do if such a re-encoding is needed, but not possible. In the core scenario of network access, i.e use with RADIUS and Diameter, character encoding and normalisation information may not be available to any RADIUS/Diameter endpoint at all (the encoding information may get lost at a preceding stage, before the NAI reaches the RADIUS client). In other scenarios, the encoding information may be available at all points in the conversation. The working group finally converged on the text in section 2.6, which puts a bias on endpoints doing all conversions, and intermediate entities doing conversions only inside their local state; not modifying the NAI on the wire.<br><br>Another aspect that was discussed is that the notion of User-Name in AAA protocols and the term NAI are not an exact match; while User-Name often is used to transmit a NAI, it can also be used to transmit arbitrary strings which do not follow the NAI conventions of either <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> or draft-ietf-radext-nai. The working group concluded that this is a fact of life that can't be changed, and that implementations which inspect a User-Name can't blindly assume to get a NAI; they need to care about their own fallback/failure handling. Such handling is outside the scope of draft-ietf-radext-nai.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The concept of NAIs is not new, and the definitions of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are compatible with implementations of NAIs in the "ASCII" subset. Field evidence suggests that <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>'s provisions for dealing with characters from outside ASCII were with an overwhelming majority not implemented at all or even violated <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> and did what <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> is now suggesting anyway; so existing implementations do not conflict with the new encoding rules parts that are introduced with draft-ietf-radext-nai. It's thus a reasonable assumption that NAIs as defined in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-radext-nai/">draft-ietf-radext-nai</a> are as widely implemented as the NAIs of <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>.<br><br>The encoding and normalisation questions triggered an i18n review; the person doing that review was Pete Resnick . The review comments were one of the inputs to the discussion and were taken into account in the latest revision of the draft.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>The document shepherd is Stefan Winter . The responsible area directors of the Operations and Management area are Benoit Claise &lt;​<a href="mailto:bclaise@cisco.com">bclaise@cisco.com</a>&gt; and Joel Jaeggli &lt;​<a href="mailto:joelja@bogus.com">joelja@bogus.com</a>&gt;.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>I was active in the discussion of the draft throughout its lifetime (at the time not being a co-chair but a working group participant). I have read all revisions of the draft and have given the revision which was originally put forward for PROTO Write-up (-05) another thorough read. I found some minor issues, which were subsequently resolved in the current -08. The document is now ready for publication.<br><br>(There is still a minor wordsmithing glitch which is being tracked in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176">http://tools.ietf.org/wg/radext/trac/ticket/176</a> ; it will be fixed with the IETF Last Call comments or during the publication process )<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>This draft has gotten significant exposure; it was commented on by many working group members and also experts from outside the working group. I have no concerns about the breadth and depth of the review process.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>Internationalisation is the big topic of this follow-up to <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>; it introduces new ways of handling internationalisation and puts recommendations on end systems. The end systems need to make sure user input from UI or configuration items are in UTF-8 or will be converted to UTF-8 before sending them on the wire; they should also perform normalisation. The internationalisation review by Pete Resnick was called for in an ad-hoc, informal manner by a WG participant, and was for an earlier revision of the draft (-02). It might be useful to flag the document in its current state to i18n experts again for a thorough review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The big items of discussion were outlined earlier in the write-up. There is no perfect way to define NAI, normalisation, and encoding in the complex multi-protocol usage that is the deployed reality. The working group reached a consensus which appears to be the most useful way of dealing with the topics in question. I thus have no concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>There is only one author, and he has submitted the draft with the pre-2008 boiler plate text. There are large passages of text pulled-in from <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> and other documents, which could not be worked around; nor did the original authors agree on changing the IPR. This justifies the pre-2008 boilerplate.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There are no known IPR disclosures surrounding this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The number of people who discussed this draft is comparatively high. I believe the WG as a whole stands behind this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>There were no threats of appeal. There was friction in the contentious points I mentioned earlier in the write-up, but in the absence of a perfect solution, the document as-is found support by a high majority of participants.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>-- Obsolete informational reference (is this intentional?): <a href="/doc/rfc5335/">RFC 5335</a><br><br>After checking back with the author, this obsolete reference *is* intentional. The RFC contains an ABNF production for email headers which the current document refers to; the successor to <a href="/doc/rfc5335/">RFC5335</a> (<a href="/doc/rfc6532/">RFC6532</a>) does not contain that ABNF any more.<br><br>The document contains a non-ASCII example. That's not a nit, but raises the question if this document should be published as UTF-8 text. It would certainly help readability.<br><br>It occured to me that the normative reference to <a href="/doc/rfc5234/">RFC5234</a> does not mention that this RFC is also <a href="/doc/std68/">STD68</a>. I don't know if this is something the author has to fix (references are usually auto-generated and add the "STDxy" if appropriate; wondering why that didn't happen here).<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>The document did not have to go through MIB Doctor, Media Type, nor URI type reviews because it does not assign any of these.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All normative references are issued RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>The references to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC2119</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc6365/">RFC6365</a> are BCPs. I do not believe that to be problematic though.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a>. This is reflected in the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction (section 1.4).<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4282/">RFC4282</a> had an extensive section called IANA Considerations but which had no actual actions for IANA. The text has now been moved to its own section; and the IANA Considerations are empty. This is the intended state.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>There are no new IANA registries created by this document.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>I read and reviewed the BNFs, but did not verify them with an automated parser.</div></td>
