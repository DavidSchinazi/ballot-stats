The consensus behind publication of this <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  document as an Proposed Standard RFC appears solid.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of <br>vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers<br>that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in <br>important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If<br>there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are multiple implementations.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No MIB doctor, Media Type or other expert reviews have been done.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Ulrich Herberg.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Responsible Area Director is Adrian Farrel.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document<br>Shepherd.

If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not need reviews beyond those normally done during<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AD and IESG processing.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this <br>document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? <br>For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, <br>or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has <br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, <br>detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The document shepherd has no specific concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required <br>for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been <br>filed.

If so, summarize <br>any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No IPR disclosures have been filed, referencing this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a <br>whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There has been solid WG consensus with understanding and agreement <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the whole WG. There were some concerns regarding a missing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quantitative evaluation of the performance improvement of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified optimization from Abdussalam Baryun. Nobody else shared <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his concerns, and he can therefore be considered to be "in the rough".<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If <br>so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this <br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No appeals have been threatened.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No extreme discontent has been indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If such normative references exist, what is the <br>plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All normative references are to already published RFC at the same,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or on a higher, maturity level.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list <br>these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are no downward references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs?

If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, <br>and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the <br>other RFCs is discussed.

There were some concerns regarding a missing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quantitative evaluation of the performance improvement of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; specified optimization from Abdussalam Baryun. Nobody else shared <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; his concerns, and he can therefore be considered to be "in the rough".<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If <br>so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The link quality mechanism of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protocol (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop neighbors if the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; threshold, while still retaining the corresponding link information<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as acquired from HELLO message exchange.&nbsp; This allows immediate<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; improves sufficiently.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ceases being symmetric, including while "ignored" as described above,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.&nbsp; This may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; threshold, even if only for a moment.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This specification updates <a href="/doc/rfc6130/">RFC6130</a> "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)", and <a href="/doc/rfc7181/">RFC7181</a> "The Optimized<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)" to permit retaining,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; threshold.&nbsp; This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more "robust".<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were no particular points of contention in the WG process, and the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; consensus behind publication of this document as an Proposed Standard RFC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appears solid.<br><br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?

In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are multiple implementations.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No MIB doctor, Media Type or other expert reviews have been done.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This document does not need reviews beyond those normally done during<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AD and IESG processing.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The document shepherd has no specific concerns with this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.
