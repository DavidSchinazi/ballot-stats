Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this writeup to give helpful context to Last Call and<br>Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your diligence in<br>completing it, is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a broad consensus on WG adoption with a smaller number (6-12 non-authors)<br>&nbsp;  commenting and supporting publication.&nbsp; <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  We had a great discussion of the use cases and terminology and, as a result, <br>&nbsp;  there will be changes in the version submitted for publication. One individual<br>&nbsp;  WG member strongly suggested a solution that wouldn't interoperate with routers<br>&nbsp;  not supporting Flex Algo. However, it is not uncommon for this WG member to be<br>&nbsp;  in the minority. <br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  Cisco IOS-XR has an implementation that is shipping for IS-IS. Juniper<br>&nbsp;  has an implementation that has not yet shipped. <br><br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br> <br>&nbsp;  No. A Routing Directorate review is in progress. <br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A. <br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A. <br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  It will be ready with the next revision. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard. This level is required for protocol interoperability. <br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are six authors and all have contributed to the document and will be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; engaged during the review and publication process. While the IETF discussion<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; mainly involved Ron, Shraddha, and Peter, LSR list discussions, William, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Parag, and Rajesh were responsible for the initial encodings and prototyping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; through multiple iterations. <br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp;  ISO Spec? <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. The base flex algo document has already been submitted for publication. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA allocations have been reviewed and allocated through the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; early allocation process. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A - only additions to existing IANA registries. </div></td>

Among the responsibilities is<br>answering the questions in this writeup to give helpful context to Last Call and<br>Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your diligence in<br>completing it, is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a broad consensus on WG adoption with a smaller number (6-12 non-authors)<br>&nbsp;  commenting and supporting publication.&nbsp; <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  We had a great discussion of the use cases and terminology and, as a result, <br>&nbsp;  there will be changes in the version submitted for publication. One individual<br>&nbsp;  WG member strongly suggested a solution that wouldn't interoperate with routers<br>&nbsp;  not supporting Flex Algo. However, it is not uncommon for this WG member to be<br>&nbsp;  in the minority. <br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  Cisco IOS-XR has an implementation that is shipping for IS-IS. Juniper<br>&nbsp;  has an implementation that has not yet shipped. <br><br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br> <br>&nbsp;  No. A Routing Directorate review is in progress. <br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A. <br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A. <br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  It will be ready with the next revision. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard. This level is required for protocol interoperability. <br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; There are six authors and all have contributed to the document and will be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; engaged during the review and publication process. While the IETF discussion<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; mainly involved Ron, Shraddha, and Peter, LSR list discussions, William, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Parag, and Rajesh were responsible for the initial encodings and prototyping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; through multiple iterations. <br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp;  ISO Spec? <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. The base flex algo document has already been submitted for publication. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA allocations have been reviewed and allocated through the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; early allocation process. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A - only additions to existing IANA registries. </div></td>

The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a broad consensus on WG adoption with a smaller number (6-12 non-authors)<br>&nbsp;  commenting and supporting publication.&nbsp; <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  We had a great discussion of the use cases and terminology and, as a result, <br>&nbsp;  there will be changes in the version submitted for publication. One individual<br>&nbsp;  WG memember strongly suggested a solution that wouldn't interoperate with routers<br>&nbsp;  not supporting Flex Algo. However, it is not uncommon for this WG member to be<br>&nbsp;  in the minority. <br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  Cisco IOS-XR has an implementation that is shipping for IS-IS. Juniper<br>&nbsp;  has an implementation that has not yet shipped. <br><br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br> <br>&nbsp;  No. A Routing Directorate review is in progress. <br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A. <br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A. <br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  It will be ready with the next revision. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard. This level is required for protocol interoperability. <br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed?

The full role of the shepherd is further<br>described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2], and informally. You will need the cooperation of<br>authors to complete these checks.<br><br>Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure<br>to answer all of them.<br><br>## Document History<br><br>1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a<br>&nbsp;  few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?<br><br>&nbsp;  There was a broad consensus on WG adoption with a smaller number (6-12 non-authors)<br>&nbsp;  commenting and supporting publication.&nbsp; <br><br>2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where<br>&nbsp;  the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  We had a great discussion of the use cases and terminology and, as a result, <br>&nbsp;  there will be changes in the version submitted for publication. <br><br><br>3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If<br>&nbsp;  so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the<br>&nbsp;  responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this<br>&nbsp;  questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of<br>&nbsp;  the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated<br>&nbsp;  plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,<br>&nbsp;  either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere<br>&nbsp;  (where)?<br><br>&nbsp;  There are plans to implement but none generally available.&nbsp; <br><br>### Additional Reviews<br><br>5. Does this document need review from other IETF working groups or external<br>&nbsp;  organizations? Have those reviews occurred?<br> <br>&nbsp;  No. A Routing Directorate review is in progress. <br><br>6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,<br>&nbsp;  such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  N/A. <br><br>7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module<br>&nbsp;  been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and<br>&nbsp;  formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is<br>&nbsp;  the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module<br>&nbsp;  comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A. <br><br>8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the<br>&nbsp;  final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,<br>&nbsp;  BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; N/A. <br><br>### Document Shepherd Checks<br><br>9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this<br>&nbsp;  document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready<br>&nbsp;  to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  It will be ready with the next revision. <br><br>10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reviewers encounter][6]. Do any such issues remain that would merit specific<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; attention from subsequent reviews?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the proper type of RFC? Do all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed standard. This level is required for protocol interoperability. <br><br>12. Has the interested community confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; disclosures required by [<a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>][7] and [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][8] have been filed? If not,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; explain why. If yes, summarize any discussion and conclusion regarding the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; intellectual property rights (IPR) disclosures, including links to relevant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; emails.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes. <br><br>13. Has each Author or Contributor confirmed their willingness to be listed as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; such? If the number of Authors/Editors on the front page is greater than 5,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; please provide a justification.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes - discussion of six authors in progress. <br><br>14. Identify any remaining I-D nits in this document. (See [the idnits tool][9]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and the checkbox items found in Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Simply running the idnits tool is not enough; please review the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guidelines document.<br><br>15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa?<br><br>&nbsp;  No. <br><br>16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the community have sufficient access to review any such normative<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; references?<br><br>&nbsp;  ISO Spec? <br><br>17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][10],<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP 97</a>][11])? If so, list them.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. <br><br>18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If they exist, what is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No. The base flex algo document has already been submitted for publication. <br><br>19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br><br>20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][12]).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The IANA allocations have been reviewed and allocated through the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; early allocation process. <br><br>21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; N/A - only additions to existing IANA registries. </div></td>
