 To extract more than one ECE indication per RTT, a ConEx sender could<br>&nbsp;  set the CWR flag continuously to force the receiver to signal only<br>&nbsp;  one ECE per CE mark.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the use of delayed ACKs<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5681/">RFC5681</a>] (which is common) will prevent feedback of every CE mark;<br>&nbsp;  if a CWR confirmation is received before the ECE can be sent out on<br>&nbsp;  the next ACK, ECN feedback information could get lost (depeding on<br><br>[O] depeding<br>[P] depending<br>[R] spelling<br><br>&nbsp;

All<br>&nbsp;  packets carrying payload MUST be marked with the X flag set,<br>&nbsp;  including retransmissions.&nbsp; Only if no congestion feedback<br>&nbsp;  information is (currently) available, the X flag SHOULD be zero, such<br>&nbsp;

Setting the E or the L Flag<br><br>&nbsp;  As described in section Section 3.1, the sender needs to maintain a<br>&nbsp;  CEG counter and might maintain a LEG counter.&nbsp; If no LEG is used, all<br>&nbsp;  retransmission will be marked with the L flag.<br><br>&nbsp;  Further, as long as the LEG or CEG counter is positive, the sender<br>&nbsp;  marks each ConEx-capable packet with L or E respectively, and<br>&nbsp;  decreases the LEG or CEG counter by the TCP payload bytes carried in<br>&nbsp;  the marked packet (assuming headers are not being counted because<br>&nbsp;  packet sizes are regular).&nbsp; No matter how small the value of LEG or<br>&nbsp;  CEG, if it is positive, the sender MUST NOT defer packet marking to<br>&nbsp;  ensure ConEx signals are timely.&nbsp; Therefore the value of LEG and CEG<br><br>[O] No matter how small the value of LEG or<br><br>&nbsp;

If a credit signal is also pending<br>&nbsp;  (see next section), the C flag can be set as well.<br><br>4.2.&nbsp; Setting the Credit Flag<br>...<br><br>&nbsp;  Recall that CSC will be decreased whenever congestion occurs,<br>&nbsp;

 In TCP Slow Start, the congestion window might grow much larger than<br>&nbsp;  during the rest of the transmission.&nbsp; Likely, a sender could consider<br>&nbsp;  sending fewer than F credits but risking being penalized by an audit<br>&nbsp;  function.&nbsp; However, the credits should at least cover the increase in<br>&nbsp;  sending rate.&nbsp; Given the exponential increase as implemented in the<br>&nbsp;  TCP Slow Start algorithm which means that the sending rate doubles<br>&nbsp;  every RTT, a ConEx sender should at least cover half the number of<br>&nbsp;  packets in flight by credits.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the number of losses or markings within one RTT does not<br>&nbsp;  solely depend on the sender's actions.&nbsp; In general, the behavior of<br>&nbsp;  the cross traffic, whether active queue management (AQM) is used and<br>&nbsp;  how it is parameterized influence how many packets might be dropped<br>&nbsp;  or marked.&nbsp; As long as any AQM encountered is not overly aggressive<br>&nbsp;  with ECN marking, sending half the flight size as credits should be<br>&nbsp;  sufficient whether congestion is signaled by loss or ECN.<br><br>&nbsp;

Loss of ConEx information<br><br>&nbsp;  Packets carrying ConEx signals could be discarded themselves.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  will be a second order problem (e.g. if the loss probability is 0.1%,<br>&nbsp;  the probability of losing a ConEx L signal will be 0.1% of 0.1% =<br>&nbsp;  0.01%).&nbsp; Further, the penality an audit induces should be propotional<br><br>[O] Further, the penality an audit induces should be propotional<br>[P] Further, the penalty an audit induces should be proportionate<br>[R] spelling x 2<br><br>&nbsp;

 problem, accepting instead the risk that an audit function might<br>&nbsp;  wrongly penalize a flow.<br><br>&nbsp;  Nonetheless, a ConEx sender is responsible to always signal<br><br>[O]&nbsp; responsible to always signal<br>[P] responsible for always signalling<br>[R] grammar<br><br>&nbsp;  sufficient congestion feedback and therefore SHOULD remember which<br>&nbsp;  packet was marked with either the L, the E or the C flag.&nbsp; If one of<br>&nbsp;  these packets is detected as lost, the sender SHOULD increase the<br>&nbsp;  respective gauge(s), LEG or CEG, by the number of lost payload bytes<br>&nbsp;  in addition to increasing LEG for the loss.<br><br>6.&nbsp; Timeliness of the ConEx Signals<br><br>&nbsp;  ConEx signals will only be useful to a network node within a time<br>&nbsp;  delay of about one RTT after the congestion occurred.&nbsp; To avoid<br>&nbsp;  further delays, a ConEx sender SHOULD send the ConEx signaling on the<br>&nbsp;  next available packet.<br><br>&nbsp;  Any or all of the ConEx flags can be used in the same packet, which<br>&nbsp;  allows delay to be minimised when multiple signals are pending.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  need to set multiple ConEx flags at the same time, can occur if e.g<br><br>[O] at the same time, can occur<br>[P] at the same time can occur<br>[R] unnecessary comma; grammar<br><br>&nbsp;  an ACK is received by the sender that simultaneously indicates that<br>&nbsp;  at least one ECN mark was received, and that one or more segements<br><br>[O] segements<br>[P] segments<br>[R] spelling<br><br>&nbsp;

 lost, so that a subsequent ACK carries summary information not<br>&nbsp;  previously available to the sender.<br><br>&nbsp;  If a flow becomes application-limited, there could be insufficient<br>&nbsp;  bytes to send to reduce the gauges to zero or below.&nbsp; In such cases,<br>&nbsp;  the sender cannot help but delay ConEx signals.&nbsp; Nonetheless, as long<br>&nbsp;  as the sender is marking all outgoing packets, an audit function is<br>&nbsp;  unlikely to penalize ConEx-marked packets.&nbsp; Therefore, no matter how<br>&nbsp;  long a gauge has been positive, a sender MUST NOT reduce the gauge by<br>&nbsp;  more than the ConEx marked bytes it has sent.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the CEG or LEG counter is negative, the respective counter MAY be<br>&nbsp;  reset to zero within one RTT after it was decreased the last time or<br>&nbsp;  one RTT after recovery if no further congestion occurred.<br><br>7.&nbsp; Open Areas for Experimentation<br><br>&nbsp;  All proposed mechanisms in this document are experimental, and<br>&nbsp;  therefore further large-scale experimentation in the Internet is<br>&nbsp;  required to evaluate if the signaling provided by these mechanisms is<br>&nbsp;  accurate and timely enough to produce value for ConEx-based (traffic<br>&nbsp;  management or other) mechanisms.<br><br>&nbsp;  The current ConEx specifications assume that congestion is counted in<br>&nbsp;

However,<br>&nbsp;  there are also devices that may allocate a certain amount of memory<br>&nbsp;  per packet, no matter how larger a packet is.&nbsp; These devices get<br>&nbsp;  congested based on the number of packets in their memory and<br>&nbsp;  therefore in this case congestion is determined by the number of<br>&nbsp;  packets that have been lost or marked.&nbsp; Furthermore, a transport<br>&nbsp;  layer endpoint, such as a TCP sender or receiver, might not know the<br>&nbsp;  exact number of bytes that a lower layer was carrying.&nbsp; Therefore a<br>&nbsp;  TCP endpoint may only be able to estimate the exact number of<br>&nbsp;  congested bytes (assuming that all lower layer header have the same<br>&nbsp;

Review by Wes Eddy:<br><br><br>1) I was very curious about implementation status, and saw<br>that this part of the shepherd write-up had not been filled<br>out, so I'm still curious whether it has been implemented.<br><br>2) In the first paragraph of section 1, I think it should be<br>more clear whether the intent is to describe modifications to<br>ConEx, to TCP, or to both.&nbsp; This would just help to make the<br>scope more clear early on.<br><br>3) It's confusing that section 2 has a MUST for implementing<br>SACK and ECN, but that the algorithms described in the document<br>do not actually require SACK or ECN to be in use in order to<br>basically work.&nbsp; It seems that this really should be a "SHOULD"<br>rather than a "MUST", because it obviously makes sense to do,<br>but proper operation doesn't actually require SACK and ECN.<br><br>4) Instead of "preferably with AccECN feedback" in section 2,<br>I think this is a classical case where using "SHOULD" would<br>be appropriate.<br><br>5) The second to last paragraph in section 2 has a "should"<br>(lowercase) that might be better as a SHOULD, though it's<br>not really clear to me.&nbsp; How exact the ConEx signal has to<br>be in order to produce value for the network or flow(s) is<br>not very clear, and probably an open research topic that<br>would be good to mention, as this is going for Experimental<br>and not all the answers are known.&nbsp; Some of the guidance in<br>the document seems to be based purely on some trains of logic<br>and reasoning rather than from measurements or experience<br>that might (or might not) differ from logic and reason.<br><br>6) In section 3, the discussion of equal-sized packets seems<br>like it would be of dubious use or clarity to someone<br>implementing this.&nbsp; It seems to me like it would be pretty<br>tough to figure out in the TCP code whether or not equal-sized<br>packets or even equally distributed packet sizes are valid<br>assumptions ahead of time for a given connection.&nbsp; At least,<br>I can't imagine how this logic would work in general, beyond<br>toy cases.<br><br>7) The last paragraph before section 3.1 (starting with<br>"Otherwise, if a sender") is a really confusing paragraph for me,<br>at least.&nbsp; I think the whole thing needs to be restructured and<br>clarified.&nbsp; For instance "memorize or estimate" are two very<br>different things, and it's not clear which is recommended or<br>whether it's really the number of packets or of bytes in those<br>packets that's relevant, the way other text is worded.<br><br>In this section, in general, some high level simple equations,<br>diagrams, or more clear sketch about the relation of the signals<br>that show up in packets, the counters that are being kept, and<br>the estimated or actual numbers of header and data bytes and<br>packets being tracked.<br><br>8) Section 3.2.2 seems like it should be split up a bit.&nbsp; Part<br>of it is purely describing how to perform the counter tracking,<br>but much of it is just a handwaving argument about a possible way<br>to get more than one ECE indication per CE mark by setting CWR<br>continuously.&nbsp; While I think it's probably correct, it's really<br>a confusing discussion without some diagram or walk-though<br>scenarios, and unfortunately I don't think someone fresh that<br>took up this document in order to write some code would have a<br>good feeling about what they just should specifically do or not<br>do after reading this section once or twice.&nbsp; It seems to me like<br>a separate section or appendix could hold the discussion about<br>this and note it as future research for experimentation.<br><br>9) Section 4.2 has "Howver" instead of "However".<br><br>10) In section 4.2, 5th paragraph, there are other flavors of<br>startup behavior than just slow start, even published as RFCs<br>(Limited Slow Start, Quick-Start, etc), and others in widespread<br>implementations.&nbsp; Probably this means that the guidance in Section<br>4.2 should be phrased generically based on the behavior of startup<br>and probing algorithms in general and not specific to the slow-start<br>doubling.<br><br>11) I think "halve" should be "half" in 2 places in section 4.2.<br><br>12) There should definitely be a "Future Research" topics section,<br>or something like this that identifies clearly why this has been<br>brought as Experimental rather than Standards Track and suggests<br>productive future work in some of the areas where the document<br>waffles.<br><br>13) I know as an author, I may be biased, but I think the problem<br>of loss estimation is not exactly the same as that of detecting<br>and correcting from spurious retransmission events; some simple<br>algorithms for loss estimation on a TCP sender are described and<br>measured in an old paper:<br><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=974038&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=678407041&amp;CFTOKEN=41231580">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=974038&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=678407041&amp;CFTOKEN=41231580</a><br>The guidance in section 3.1 of this I-D about a sender using some<br>heuristics to detect spurious retransmissions and account for them<br>seems too unspecific to me, and I would guess that recommending a<br>particular algorithm or construction for specifically measuring or<br>estimating packet losses is more appropriate for implementers to<br>understand what they need to do.<br><br>14) In general, I do think it can be read and understood, but I<br>would also think it will not be easy to directly implement for<br>someone without a lot of time to do their own research and<br>look into the many tradeoffs or several open-ended parts of this<br>document.&nbsp; It reads more like a general discussion of how to<br>implement ConEx for TCP than a precise specification.</div></td>

This document proposes some concrete algorithms for <br>determining how much credit to signal during congestion avoidance and <br>slow start. The wider goal of ConEx is to reflect the 'cost' of the risk of <br>causing congestion on those that contribute most to it. Experimentation <br>is encouraged to improve or maintain performance while reducing the <br>risk of causing congestion <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform<br>&nbsp;  the network about expected congestion based on congestion feedback<br>&nbsp;  from previous packets in the same flow.&nbsp; This document describes the<br>&nbsp;  necessary modifications to use ConEx with the Transmission Control<br>&nbsp;  Protocol (TCP).<br><br>Working Group Summary<br>&nbsp; This draft has been a working group document for about 4 years and <br>&nbsp; has been well reviewed. There are no major issues open on the contents<br>&nbsp; of this draft.&nbsp; <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Suresh Krishnan is the document shepherd. Martin Stiemerling is the<br>&nbsp; responsible area director.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; I have reviewed the document and I believe that it is ready to be <br>&nbsp; sent to the IESG for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>No.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br> The conex working group has not been very active recently. I would<br>&nbsp; characterize the consensus behind this document to be strong, based<br>&nbsp; on the strong concurrence of few individuals with others being silent.<br>&nbsp;  <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No. <br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>The document does not require any IANA action.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.
