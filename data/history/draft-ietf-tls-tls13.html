The Gen-ART reviewer wrote a lengthy review that I encourage the author/WG to look at. Many of his comments relate to stylistic preferences in the text and some of them might have been more actionable earlier in the process (e.g., the suggestion for a minor error code, which I like but wouldn't hold this up over), but they are worth reviewing. For example, I was also confused about the use of "fatal alert" versus "error alert," and I also found the invocation of the SNI check in 4.6.1 to be introduced abruptly.</div></td>

It's a surprisingly understandable document, given its length and the complexity of the subject. I am balloting yes, but I have a few minor comments and nits. None of these are showstoppers, so please do with them as you will.<br><br>*** Substantive Comments:<br><br>§4.1.2, first paragraph: " When a client first connects to a server, it is REQUIRED to send the<br>&nbsp;  ClientHello as its first message. "<br><br>Is that intended to prohibit the use of STARTTLS or similar application layer patterns?<br>(To be clear, this is not an objection, just a clarification request.)<br><br>§4.1.2, legacy_compression_methods: "Note that TLS 1.3 servers might receive TLS 1.2 or prior<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ClientHellos which contain other compression methods and MUST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; follow the procedures for the appropriate prior version of TLS."<br><br>Is that intended to require TLS 1.3 servers to always be willing and able to negotiate 1.2? §4.2.1<br>has a similar assertion:<br><br>"If this extension is not present, servers which are compliant with<br>&nbsp;  this specification MUST negotiate TLS 1.2 or prior as specified in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>], even if ClientHello.legacy_version is 0x0304 or later."<br><br>But §4.2.3 says:<br><br> "Note that TLS 1.2 defines this extension differently.&nbsp; TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp;  implementations willing to negotiate TLS 1.2 MUST behave in<br>&nbsp;  accordance with the requirements of [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>] when negotiating that<br>&nbsp;  version."<br><br>... which seems inconsistent (noting that this paragraph talks about "implementations"<br>rather than "servers", so perhaps there's a subtle difference? <br><br>§4.2.1.1: The section is marked for removal. Do you expect that RFC implementations <br>will ever need to interop with draft implementations? If so, the information in this section<br>may continue to be useful for some time.<br><br>§D.5: This section has a lot of normative requirements that seem important. I wonder why it has been<br>relegated to an appendix.<br><br><br>*** Editorial Comments and nits:<br><br>§2: "If (EC)DHE key establishment<br>&nbsp;  is in use, then the ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with<br>&nbsp;  the server’s ephemeral Diffie-Hellman share which MUST be in the same<br>&nbsp;  group as one of the client’s shares. "<br><br>missing comma prior to "which".<br><br>§4.1.1: "Note that if the PSK can be used without (EC)DHE then non-<br>&nbsp;  overlap in the "supported_groups" parameters need not be fatal, as it<br>&nbsp;  is in the non-PSK case discussed in the previous paragraph."<br><br>I read "need not be fatal" to mean that it may still be fatal at times. Is that the intent?<br><br>§11: The IANA considerations have a number of constructions similar to "SHALL update/has updated".<br>Is that text expected to collapse to "has updated" at some point?<br><br>§E.2.1: [BDFKPPRSZZ16]&nbsp; : Best citation anchor evar</div></td>

However, I understand that this has been the approach TLS has previously taken and is supported by the way the document is written. Still, I find it especially confusing that also two TLS1.2 extensions are deprecated which are not needed with TLS1.3 anymore but still probably valid to be used with TLS1.2, right? <br>I would recommend for this version to at least already note in the abstract or very early in the intro that it changes the versioning mechanism itself, and thereby basically declares the TLS handshake as an invariant for all future versions and extensibility is only provided using extensions anymore.<br><br>2) Can you provide further explanation (potentially in the draft) why the Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes are provided in an extra/separate extension? <br><br>3) I know previous versions of TLS didn't say that much either, but I find it a bit wired that there are NO requirements for the underlaying transport in this document. Previous version this at least said in the intro that a reliable transport (like TCP) is assumed, but even this minimal information seems to have gotten lost in this document. However, I would usually also expect to seen some minimal text about connection handling, e.g. is it okay to transparently try to reestablish the connection by the underlying transport protocol if it broke for some reason? Or it is okay to use the same TCP connection to first send other data and then start the TLS handshake?<br><br>4) Regarding the registration policies: I assume the intend of changing them is to make it easier to specify and use new extensions/mechanism. However, I am wondering why the policies have been changed to "Specification Required" and not "IETF consensus" or RFC Required"? <br><br>5) I find it a bit strange that basically the whole working group is listed as contributors. My understanding was that Contributors are people that have contributed a "significant" amount of text, while everybody else who e.g. brought ideas in during mailing list discussion would be acknowledged only.</div></td>

In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; There are over 10 interoperable implementations of the<br>&nbsp; protocol from different sources written in different<br>&nbsp; languages.&nbsp; Major web browser vendors and TLS<br>&nbsp; library vendors have draft implementations or have<br>&nbsp; indicated they will support the protocol.&nbsp; In addition to<br>&nbsp; having extensive review in the TLS working group,<br>&nbsp; the protocol has received unprecedented security<br>&nbsp; review by the academic community.&nbsp; Several TRON (TLS<br>&nbsp; Ready or Not) conferences were held in conjunction with<br>&nbsp; the academic community to give them a chance to present<br>&nbsp; their findings for TLS.&nbsp; These conferences resulted in<br>&nbsp; improvements to the protocol.<br><br>&nbsp; Please note that ID-nits complains about the obsoleted/<br>&nbsp; updated RFCs not being listed in the abstract. This is<br>&nbsp; intentional because the abstract is now a concise and<br>&nbsp; comprehensive overview and is free form citations, as<br>&nbsp; per <a href="/doc/rfc7322/">RFC7322</a>.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Sean Turner.<br>&nbsp; The responsible AD is Kathleen Moriarty.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document and believes<br>&nbsp; it is ready for publication<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Extensive review has been performed on this document.<br>&nbsp; Interoperable implementations exist.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; This document has had extensive review form the security and<br>&nbsp; cryptographic community.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The previous AD had concerns with the 0-RTT mode that supports early<br>&nbsp; data.&nbsp; This early data is subject to replay attacks and is only safe to use<br>&nbsp; when the replay of data does not have negative consequences.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp; that s2.3 (page 21) provides a warning about the use of early data and<br>&nbsp; indicates that protocols MUST NOT use it unless there is an application<br>&nbsp; profile for early data’s use.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; A third party IPR disclosure has been filed for the<br>&nbsp; document <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/</a>.&nbsp; The disclosure is<br>&nbsp; the same as for TLS 1.2.&nbsp; The following disclosure<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/</a> states that implementors<br>&nbsp; do not need a license.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from a large number of individuals<br>&nbsp; in the working group.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID Nits complains about missing obsoletes/updates information in<br>&nbsp; the abstract, but see the response to question #16 for information<br>&nbsp; about these nits.<br><br>&nbsp; There are some incorrectly noted missing references; these are part<br>&nbsp; of figures or the presentation syntax. <br><br>&nbsp; Two obsolete informational references are noted, but these should<br>&nbsp; remain because the references work as is; the registries were originally<br>&nbsp; defined in 4346 and 4366, i.e., the fact these RFCs were updated later<br>&nbsp; is irrelevant.<br><br>&nbsp; There are downref-related nits noted, but these are addressed by<br>&nbsp; question #15.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Not Applicable<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reports three possible downrefs: SHS, X690, and X962.<br>&nbsp; None of these are downrefs.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits also reports 8 downrefs: RFCs 2104 and 5869 are<br>&nbsp; already in the downref registry; RFCs 6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017,<br>&nbsp; and 8032 are not; <a href="/doc/rfc8017/">RFC8017</a> was as <a href="/doc/rfc3447/">RFC 3447</a>.&nbsp; 6962 (Certificate<br>&nbsp; Transparency) is an experimental RFC; 6979 is referred to<br>&nbsp; normatively by many other drafts and frankly this is an “algorithm”<br>&nbsp; reference so this is totally normal (algorithms are always<br>&nbsp; informational); 7539, 7749, and 8032 are already referred<br>&nbsp; to normatively by many RFCs so it seems like all of these should<br>&nbsp; already be in the downref registry and shouldn’t be an issue.<br><br>&nbsp; These 5 RFCs (6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017, and 8032) need to<br>&nbsp; be included in the IETF LC and then they need to be added to the<br>&nbsp; downref registry ;)<br><br>&nbsp; Note that references to <a href="/doc/rfc4346/">RFC 4346</a> and 4366 are intentional.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft obsoletes 2 drafts and updates 4.&nbsp; They are listed on the<br>&nbsp; title page, not listed in the abstract, and are discussed in the<br>&nbsp; introduction.&nbsp; The chairs and author feel this is sufficient, i.e., we<br>&nbsp; don’t need it in the abstract.&nbsp; Few people can remember without<br>&nbsp; context what the contents of an RFC are the author and chairs both<br>&nbsp; feel that the explanation in s1 (last para) is sufficient.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp; other appropriate locations also repeat the updates/obsoletes, e.g.,<br>&nbsp; s2.3, s.4.2.6.<br><br>&nbsp; The one interesting obsoletes/updates issue is that this draft does<br>&nbsp; include optional updates for TLS1.2 that a TLS1.3 implementation<br>&nbsp; might want to support to negotiate TLS1.2.&nbsp; It would look odd to<br>&nbsp; include 5246 in both the updates and obsoletes header fields and<br>&nbsp; overall we’re obsoleting 5246 so that’s what was done, i.e., 5246<br>&nbsp; is obsoleted by this document but not updated by it.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The changes to IANA’s TLS-related registries as a result of TLS1.3<br>&nbsp; are quite extensive, but most of them are made in<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/</a>.<br>&nbsp; The changes to registry policies are also reflected in<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/">draft-ietf-tls-tls13</a> when the registry was retained.&nbsp; Note that some<br>&nbsp; registries have been orphaned and some have had space allocated<br>&nbsp; for TLS1.3 and pre-TLS1.3.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft creates one new registry: TLS SignatureScheme Registry.<br>&nbsp; The registry is divided between Specification Required and Private<br>&nbsp; Use space.&nbsp; The registration policies for this space align with similar<br>&nbsp; TLS-related registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There have been numerous published analyses of the security of some<br>&nbsp; or all of TLS 1.3, including at least three using automatic theorem provers<br>&nbsp; (ProVerif, Tamarin, and F*).&nbsp; A detailed list of papers analyzing TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp; can be found in Appendix E.<br></div></td>

This is<br>&nbsp; intentional because the abstract is now a concise and<br>&nbsp; comprehensive overview and is free form citations, as<br>&nbsp; per <a href="/doc/rfc7322/">RFC7322</a>.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Sean Turner.<br>&nbsp; The responsible AD is Kathleen Moriarity.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document and believes<br>&nbsp; it is ready for publication<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Extensive review has been performed on this document.<br>&nbsp; Interoperable implementations exist.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; This document has had extensive review form the security and<br>&nbsp; cryptographic community.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The previous AD had concerns with the 0-RTT mode that supports early<br>&nbsp; data.&nbsp; This early data is subject to replay attacks and is only safe to use<br>&nbsp; when the replay of data does not have negative consequences.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp; that s2.3 (page 21) provides a warning about the use of early data and<br>&nbsp; indicates that protocols MUST NOT use it unless there is an application<br>&nbsp; profile for early data’s use.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; A third party IPR disclosure has been filed for the<br>&nbsp; document <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/</a>.&nbsp; The disclosure is<br>&nbsp; the same as for TLS 1.2.&nbsp; The following disclosure<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/</a> states that implementors<br>&nbsp; do not need a license.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from a large number of individuals<br>&nbsp; in the working group.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID Nits complains about missing obsoletes/updates information in<br>&nbsp; the abstract, but see the response to question #16 for information<br>&nbsp; about these nits.<br><br>&nbsp; There are some incorrectly noted missing references; these are part<br>&nbsp; of figures or the presentation syntax. <br><br>&nbsp; Two obsolete informational references are noted, but these should<br>&nbsp; remain because the references work as is; the registries were originally<br>&nbsp; defined in 4346 and 4366, i.e., the fact these RFCs were updated later<br>&nbsp; is irrelevant.<br><br>&nbsp; There are downref-related nits noted, but these are addressed by<br>&nbsp; question #15.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Not Applicable<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reports three possible downrefs: SHS, X690, and X962.<br>&nbsp; None of these are downrefs.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits also reports 8 downrefs: RFCs 2104 and 5869 are<br>&nbsp; already in the downref registry; RFCs 6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017,<br>&nbsp; and 8032 are not; <a href="/doc/rfc8017/">RFC8017</a> was as <a href="/doc/rfc3447/">RFC 3447</a>.&nbsp; 6962 (Certificate<br>&nbsp; Transparency) is an experimental RFC; 6979 is referred to<br>&nbsp; normatively by many other drafts and frankly this is an “algorithm”<br>&nbsp; reference so this is totally normal (algorithms are always<br>&nbsp; informational); 7539, 7749, and 8032 are already referred<br>&nbsp; to normatively by many RFCs so it seems like all of these should<br>&nbsp; already be in the downref registry and shouldn’t be an issue.<br><br>&nbsp; These 5 RFCs (6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017, and 8032) need to<br>&nbsp; be included in the IETF LC and then they need to be added to the<br>&nbsp; downref registry ;)<br><br>&nbsp; Note that references to <a href="/doc/rfc4346/">RFC 4346</a> and 4366 are intentional.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft obsoletes 2 drafts and updates 4.&nbsp; They are listed on the<br>&nbsp; title page, not listed in the abstract, and are discussed in the<br>&nbsp; introduction.&nbsp; The chairs and author feel this is sufficient, i.e., we<br>&nbsp; don’t need it in the abstract.&nbsp; Few people can remember without<br>&nbsp; context what the contents of an RFC are the author and chairs both<br>&nbsp; feel that the explanation in s1 (last para) is sufficient.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp; other appropriate locations also repeat the updates/obsoletes, e.g.,<br>&nbsp; s2.3, s.4.2.6.<br><br>&nbsp; The one interesting obsoletes/updates issue is that this draft does<br>&nbsp; include optional updates for TLS1.2 that a TLS1.3 implementation<br>&nbsp; might want to support to negotiate TLS1.2.&nbsp; It would look odd to<br>&nbsp; include 5246 in both the updates and obsoletes header fields and<br>&nbsp; overall we’re obsoleting 5246 so that’s what was done, i.e., 5246<br>&nbsp; is obsoleted by this document but not updated by it.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The changes to IANA’s TLS-related registries as a result of TLS1.3<br>&nbsp; are quite extensive, but most of them are made in<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/</a>.<br>&nbsp; The changes to registry policies are also reflected in<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/">draft-ietf-tls-tls13</a> when the registry was retained.&nbsp; Note that some<br>&nbsp; registries have been orphaned and some have had space allocated<br>&nbsp; for TLS1.3 and pre-TLS1.3.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft creates one new registry: TLS SignatureScheme Registry.<br>&nbsp; The registry is divided between Specification Required and Private<br>&nbsp; Use space.&nbsp; The registration policies for this space align with similar<br>&nbsp; TLS-related registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There have been numerous published analyses of the security of some<br>&nbsp; or all of TLS 1.3, including at least three using automatic theorem provers<br>&nbsp; (ProVerif, Tamarin, and F*).&nbsp; A detailed list of papers analyzing TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp; can be found in Appendix E.<br></div></td>

If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; There are over 10 interoperable implementations of the<br>&nbsp; protocol from different sources written in different<br>&nbsp; languages.&nbsp; The Major web browser vendors and TLS<br>&nbsp; libraries vendors have draft implementationsor have<br>&nbsp; indicated they will support the protocol in the future.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp; addition to having extensive review in the TLS working<br>&nbsp; group, the protocol has received unprecedented security<br>&nbsp; review by the academic community.&nbsp; Several TRON (TLS<br>&nbsp; Ready or Not) conferences were held with academic<br>&nbsp; community to give them a chance to present their<br>&nbsp; findings for TLS.&nbsp; This has resulted in improvements to<br>&nbsp; the protocol.<br><br>&nbsp; Please note that ID-nits complains about the obsoleted/<br>&nbsp; updated RFCs not being listed in the abstract. This is<br>&nbsp; intentional because the abstract is now a concise and<br>&nbsp; comprehensive overview and is free form citations, as<br>&nbsp; per <a href="/doc/rfc7322/">RFC7322</a>.<br><br>&nbsp; note<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; This document has had extensive review form the security and<br>&nbsp; cryptographic community.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The previous AD had concerns with the 0-RTT mode that supports early<br>&nbsp; data.&nbsp; This early data is subject to replay attacks and is only safe to use<br>&nbsp; when the replay of data does not have negative consequences.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp; that s2.3 (page 21) provides a warning about the use of early data and<br>&nbsp; indicates that protocols MUST NOT use it unless there is an application<br>&nbsp; profile for early data’s use.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from a large number of individuals<br>&nbsp; in the working group.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID Nits complains about missing obsoletes/updates information in<br>&nbsp; the abstract, but see the response to question #16 for information<br>&nbsp; about these nits.<br><br>&nbsp; There are some incorrectly noted missing references; these are part<br>&nbsp; of figures or the presentation syntax. <br><br>&nbsp; Two obsolete informational references are noted, but these should<br>&nbsp; remain because the references work as is; the registries were originally<br>&nbsp; defined in 4346 and 4366, i.e., the fact these RFCs were updated later<br>&nbsp; is irrelevant.<br><br>&nbsp; There are downref-related nits noted, but these are addressed by<br>&nbsp; question #15.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Not Applicable<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reports three possible downrefs: SHS, X690, and X962.<br>&nbsp; None of these are downrefs.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits also reports 8 downrefs: RFCs 2104 and 5869 are<br>&nbsp; already in the downref registry; RFCs 6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017,<br>&nbsp; and 8032 are not; <a href="/doc/rfc8017/">RFC8017</a> was as <a href="/doc/rfc3447/">RFC 3447</a>.&nbsp; 6962 (Certificate<br>&nbsp; Transparency) is an experimental RFC; 6979 is referred to<br>&nbsp; normatively by many other drafts and frankly this is an “algorithm”<br>&nbsp; reference so this is totally normal (algorithms are always<br>&nbsp; informational); 7539, 7749, and 8032 are already referred<br>&nbsp; to normatively by many RFCs so it seems like all of these should<br>&nbsp; already be in the downref registry and shouldn’t be an issue.<br><br>&nbsp; These 5 RFCs (6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, 8017, and 8032) need to<br>&nbsp; be included in the IETF LC and then they need to be added to the<br>&nbsp; downref registry ;)<br><br>&nbsp; Note that references to <a href="/doc/rfc4346/">RFC 4346</a> and 4366 are intentional.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft obsoletes 2 drafts and updates 4.&nbsp; They are listed on the<br>&nbsp; title page, not listed in the abstract, and are discussed in the<br>&nbsp; introduction.&nbsp; The chairs and author feel this is sufficient, i.e., we<br>&nbsp; don’t need it in the abstract.&nbsp; Few people can remember without<br>&nbsp; context what the contents of an RFC are the author and chairs both<br>&nbsp; feel that the explanation in s1 (last para) is sufficient.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp; other appropriate locations also repeat the updates/obsoletes, e.g.,<br>&nbsp; s2.3, s.4.2.6.<br><br>&nbsp; The one interesting obsoletes/updates issue is that this draft does<br>&nbsp; include optional updates for TLS1.2 that a TLS1.3 implementation<br>&nbsp; might want to support to negotiate TLS1.2.&nbsp; It would look odd to<br>&nbsp; include 5246 in both the updates and obsoletes header fields and<br>&nbsp; overall we’re obsoleting 5246 so that’s what was done, i.e., 5246<br>&nbsp; is obsoleted by this document but not updated by it.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The changes to IANA’s TLS-related registries as a result of TLS1.3<br>&nbsp; are quite extensive, but most of them are made in<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/</a>.<br>&nbsp; The changes to registry policies are also reflected in<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/">draft-ietf-tls-tls13</a> when the registry was retained.&nbsp; Note that some<br>&nbsp; registries have been orphaned and some have had space allocated<br>&nbsp; for TLS1.3 and pre-TLS1.3.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft creates one new registry: TLS SignatureScheme Registry.<br>&nbsp; The registry is divided between Specification Required and Private<br>&nbsp; Use space.&nbsp; The registration policies for this space align with similar<br>&nbsp; TLS-related registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There have been numerous published analyses of the security of some<br>&nbsp; or all of TLS 1.3, including at least three using automatic theorem provers<br>&nbsp; (ProVerif, Tamarin, and F*).&nbsp; A detailed list of papers analyzing TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp; can be found in Appendix E.<br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies version 1.3 of the Transport Layer Security<br>&nbsp;  (TLS) protocol.&nbsp; TLS allows client/server applications to communicate<br>&nbsp;  over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,<br>&nbsp;  tampering, and message forgery.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; The document is the work product of the members of the TLS<br>&nbsp; WG.&nbsp; There is strong consensus in the working group for this<br>&nbsp; document.&nbsp; The area that was most controversial was around<br>&nbsp; the inclusion of a 0-RTT mode that has different security<br>&nbsp; properties than the rest of TLS.&nbsp; s1.3 lists the major differences<br>&nbsp; from TLS1.2, as agreed by the contributors; we do not think<br>&nbsp; that the RFC needs to list the changes that occurred between<br>&nbsp; each draft.<br><br>&nbsp; The draft has had 3 WGLCs to address various issues.&nbsp; At this<br>&nbsp; point there are no known outstanding issue.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; There are over 10 interoperable implementations of the<br>&nbsp; protocol from different sources written in different<br>&nbsp; languages.&nbsp; The Major web browser vendors and TLS<br>&nbsp; libraries vendors have draft implementationsor have<br>&nbsp; indicated they will support the protocol in the future.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp; addition to having extensive review in the TLS working<br>&nbsp; group, the protocol has received unprecedented security<br>&nbsp; review by the academic community.&nbsp; Several TRON (TLS<br>&nbsp; Ready or Not) conferences were held with academic<br>&nbsp; community to give them a chance to present their<br>&nbsp; findings for TLS.&nbsp; This has resulted in improvements to<br>&nbsp; the protocol.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Sean Turner.<br>&nbsp; The responsible AD is Kathleen Moriarity.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document and believes<br>&nbsp; it is ready for publication<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Extensive review has been performed on this document.<br>&nbsp; Interoperable implementations exist.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; This document has had extensive review form the security and<br>&nbsp; cryptographic community.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The previous AD had concerns with the 0-RTT mode that supports early<br>&nbsp; data.&nbsp; This early data is subject to replay attacks and is only safe to use<br>&nbsp; when the replay of data does not have negative consequences.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp; that s2.3 (page 21) provides a warning about the use of early data and<br>&nbsp; indicates that protocols MUST NOT use it unless there is an application<br>&nbsp; profile for early data’s use.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; A third party IPR disclosure has been filed for the<br>&nbsp; document <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/</a>.&nbsp; The disclosure is<br>&nbsp; the same as for TLS 1.2.&nbsp; The following disclosure<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/</a> states that implementors<br>&nbsp; do not need a license.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from a large number of individuals<br>&nbsp; in the working group.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID Nits complains about missing obsoletes/updates information in<br>&nbsp; the abstract, but see the response to question #16 for information<br>&nbsp; about these nits.<br><br>&nbsp; There are some incorrectly noted missing references; these are part<br>&nbsp; of figures or the presentation syntax. <br><br>&nbsp; Two obsolete informational references are noted, but these should<br>&nbsp; remain because the references work as is; the registries were originally<br>&nbsp; defined in 4346 and 4366, i.e., the fact these RFCs were updated later<br>&nbsp; is irrelevant.<br><br>&nbsp; There are downref-related nits noted, but these are addressed by<br>&nbsp; question #15.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Not Applicable<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reports three possible downrefs: SHS, X690, and X962.<br>&nbsp; None of these are downrefs.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits also reports 8 downrefs: RFCs 2104, 3447, and 5869 are<br>&nbsp; already in the downref registry; RFCs 6962, 6979, 7539, 7748,<br>&nbsp; and 8032 are not.&nbsp; 6962 (Certificate Transparency) is an experimental<br>&nbsp; RFC; 6979 is referred to normatively by many other drafts and frankly<br>&nbsp; this is an “algorithm” reference so this is totally normal (algorithms<br>&nbsp; are always informational); 7539, 7749, and 8032 are already referred<br>&nbsp; to normatively by many RFCs so it seems like all of these should<br>&nbsp; already be in the downref registry and shouldn’t be an issue.<br><br>&nbsp; These 5 RFCs (6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, and 8032) need to be included<br>&nbsp; in the IETF LC and then they need to be added to the downref registry ;)<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft obsoletes 2 drafts and updates 4.&nbsp; They are listed on the<br>&nbsp; title page, not listed in the abstract, and are discussed in the<br>&nbsp; introduction.&nbsp; The chairs and author feel this is sufficient, i.e., we<br>&nbsp; don’t need it in the abstract.&nbsp; Few people can remember without<br>&nbsp; context what the contents of an RFC are the author and chairs both<br>&nbsp; feel that the explanation in s1 (last para) is sufficient.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp; other appropriate locations also repeat the updates/obsoletes, e.g.,<br>&nbsp; s2.3, s.4.2.6.<br><br>&nbsp; The one interesting obsoletes/updates issue is that this draft does<br>&nbsp; include optional updates for TLS1.2 that a TLS1.3 implementation<br>&nbsp; might want to support to negotiate TLS1.2.&nbsp; It would look odd to<br>&nbsp; include 5246 in both the updates and obsoletes header fields and<br>&nbsp; overall we’re obsoleting 5246 so that’s what was done, i.e., 5246<br>&nbsp; is obsoleted by this document but not updated by it.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The changes to IANA’s TLS-related registries as a result of TLS1.3<br>&nbsp; are quite extensive, but most of them are made in<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/</a>.<br>&nbsp; The changes to registry policies are also reflected in<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/">draft-ietf-tls-tls13</a> when the registry was retained.&nbsp; Note that some<br>&nbsp; registries have been orphaned and some have had space allocated<br>&nbsp; for TLS1.3 and pre-TLS1.3.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft creates one new registry: TLS SignatureScheme Registry.<br>&nbsp; The registry is divided between Specification Required and Private<br>&nbsp; Use space.&nbsp; The registration policies for this space align with similar<br>&nbsp; TLS-related registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There have been numerous published analyses of the security of some<br>&nbsp; or all of TLS 1.3, including at least three using automatic theorem provers<br>&nbsp; (ProVerif, Tamarin, and F*).&nbsp; A detailed list of papers analyzing TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp; can be found in Appendix E.<br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies version 1.3 of the Transport Layer Security<br>&nbsp;  (TLS) protocol.&nbsp; TLS allows client/server applications to communicate<br>&nbsp;  over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,<br>&nbsp;  tampering, and message forgery.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; The document is the work product of the members of the TLS<br>&nbsp; WG.&nbsp; There is strong consensus in the working group for this<br>&nbsp; document.&nbsp; The area that was most controversial was around<br>&nbsp; the inclusion of a 0-RTT mode that has different security<br>&nbsp; properties than the rest of TLS.&nbsp; s1.3 lists the major differences<br>&nbsp; from TLS1.2, as agreed by the contributors; we do not think<br>&nbsp; that the RFC needs to list the changes that occurred between<br>&nbsp; each draft.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a <br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that <br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp; There are over 10 interoperable implementations of the<br>&nbsp; protocol from different sources written in different<br>&nbsp; languages.&nbsp; The Major web browser vendors and TLS<br>&nbsp; libraries vendors have draft implementationsor have<br>&nbsp; indicated they will support the protocol in the future.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp; addition to having extensive review in the TLS working<br>&nbsp; group, the protocol has received unprecedented security<br>&nbsp; review by the academic community.&nbsp; Several TRON (TLS<br>&nbsp; Ready or Not) conferences were held with academic<br>&nbsp; community to give them a chance to present their<br>&nbsp; findings for TLS.&nbsp; This has resulted in improvements to<br>&nbsp; the protocol.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; The Document Shepherd is Sean Turner.<br>&nbsp; The responsible AD is Kathleen Moriarity.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has reviewed the document and believes<br>&nbsp; it is ready for publication<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Extensive review has been performed on this document.<br>&nbsp; Interoperable implementations exist.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; This document has had extensive review form the security and<br>&nbsp; cryptographic community.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The previous AD had concerns with the 0-RTT mode that supports early<br>&nbsp; data.&nbsp; This early data is subject to replay attacks and is only safe to use<br>&nbsp; when the replay of data does not have negative consequences.&nbsp; Note<br>&nbsp; that s2.3 (page 21) provides a warning about the use of early data and<br>&nbsp; indicates that protocols MUST NOT use it unless there is an application<br>&nbsp; profile for early data’s use.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; A third party IPR disclosure has been filed for the<br>&nbsp; document <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/2900/</a>.&nbsp; The disclosure is<br>&nbsp; the same as for TLS 1.2.&nbsp; The following disclosure<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1044/</a> states that implementors<br>&nbsp; do not need a license.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>&nbsp; There is strong consensus from a large number of individuals<br>&nbsp; in the working group.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; ID Nits complains about missing obsoletes/updates information in<br>&nbsp; the abstract, but see the response to question #16 for information<br>&nbsp; about these nits.<br><br>&nbsp; There are some incorrectly noted missing references; these are part<br>&nbsp; of figures or the presentation syntax. <br><br>&nbsp; Two obsolete informational references are noted, but these should<br>&nbsp; remain because the references work as is; the registries were originally<br>&nbsp; defined in 4346 and 4366, i.e., the fact these RFCs were updated later<br>&nbsp; is irrelevant.<br><br>&nbsp; There are downref-related nits noted, but these are addressed by<br>&nbsp; question #15.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Not Applicable<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp; ID nits reports three possible downrefs: SHS, X690, and X962.<br>&nbsp; None of these are downrefs.<br><br>&nbsp; ID nits also reports 8 downrefs: RFCs 2104, 3447, and 5869 are<br>&nbsp; already in the downref registry; RFCs 6962, 6979, 7539, 7748,<br>&nbsp; and 8032 are not.&nbsp; 6962 (Certificate Transparency) is an experimental<br>&nbsp; RFC; 6979 is referred to normatively by many other drafts and frankly<br>&nbsp; this is an “algorithm” reference so this is totally normal (algorithms<br>&nbsp; are always informational); 7539, 7749, and 8032 are already referred<br>&nbsp; to normatively by many RFCs so it seems like all of these should<br>&nbsp; already be in the downref registry and shouldn’t be an issue.<br><br>&nbsp; These 5 RFCs (6962, 6979, 7539, 7748, and 8032) need to be included<br>&nbsp; in the IETF LC and then they need to be added to the downref registry ;)<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft obsoletes 2 drafts and updates 4.&nbsp; They are listed on the<br>&nbsp; title page, not listed in the abstract, and are discussed in the<br>&nbsp; introduction.&nbsp; The chairs and author feel this is sufficient, i.e., we<br>&nbsp; don’t need it in the abstract.&nbsp; Few people can remember without<br>&nbsp; context what the contents of an RFC are the author and chairs both<br>&nbsp; feel that the explanation in s1 (last para) is sufficient.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp; other appropriate locations also repeat the updates/obsoletes, e.g.,<br>&nbsp; s2.3, s.4.2.6.<br><br>&nbsp; The one interesting obsoletes/updates issue is that this draft does<br>&nbsp; include optional updates for TLS1.2 that a TLS1.3 implementation<br>&nbsp; might want to support to negotiate TLS1.2.&nbsp; It would look odd to<br>&nbsp; include 5246 in both the updates and obsoletes header fields and<br>&nbsp; overall we’re obsoleting 5246 so that’s what was done, i.e., 5246<br>&nbsp; is obsoleted by this document but not updated by it.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The changes to IANA’s TLS-related registries as a result of TLS1.3<br>&nbsp; are quite extensive, but most of them are made in<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates/</a>.<br>&nbsp; The changes to registry policies are also reflected in<br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-tls13/">draft-ietf-tls-tls13</a> when the registry was retained.&nbsp; Note that some<br>&nbsp; registries have been orphaned and some have had space allocated<br>&nbsp; for TLS1.3 and pre-TLS1.3.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; This draft creates one new registry: TLS SignatureScheme Registry.<br>&nbsp; The registry is divided between Specification Required and Private<br>&nbsp; Use space.&nbsp; The registration policies for this space align with similar<br>&nbsp; TLS-related registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; There have been numerous published analyses of the security of some<br>&nbsp; or all of TLS 1.3, including at least three using automatic theorem provers<br>&nbsp; (ProVerif, Tamarin, and F*).&nbsp; A detailed list of papers analyzing TLS 1.3<br>&nbsp; can be found in Appendix E.<br></div></td>
