Names are just that...but it seems that using MP avoids adding one more name for the same thing.<br><br>(2) §1: "The framework is described by mainly referring to P2P...it is equally applicable to P2MP...MP2P...and MP2MP...if the sub-LSPs of these tunnels can be viewed as P2P tunnels."&nbsp; This statement is reflected in one of the requirements in §4.&nbsp; Are there cases where P2MP/MP2P/MP2MP tunnels cannot be treated as p2p?&nbsp; If so, then please add some text about that to scope the applicability.<br><br>(3) §1: "The framework does see the need for extensions of IGPs and service label distribution protocols in some procedures, particularly for supporting protection establishment and context label switching.&nbsp; This document provides guidelines for these extensions, but leaves the specific details to separate documents."&nbsp; Leaving the details to separate documents is fine.&nbsp; However, the document is not clear/straight forward about which procedures might need extensions and which do not.&nbsp; In particular, I think that this document, and future work, would benefit from a clear indication of where particular procedures are documented (which might mean adding a lot of more references), or, even better, a clear indication of the ones that are not already documented.<br><br>(4) §1: "It is RECOMMENDED that the framework SHOULD be used in conjunction with control-plane convergence or global repair..."&nbsp; RECOMMENDED and SHOULD have the same meaning.&nbsp; This sentence is redundant.<br><br>(5) §3: "A protector MAY be physically co-located with or decoupled from a backup egress router..."&nbsp; I think that the MAY is out of place because it isn't specifying anything, just stating a fact.&nbsp;

I expect the answer to be No.&nbsp; I don't think that using Normative Language in this Section is a good thing because it is not being used to require any type of interoperability (as can be argued for the rest of the document), but only to define requirements that should be satisfied in this same document.&nbsp; <br><br>(8) §5.2: "The mechanisms SHOULD be reasonably fast, i.e., faster than control plane failure detection and remote failure detection."&nbsp; When would it be ok for this mechanism to be slower?&nbsp; IOW, why isn't MUST used?<br><br>(9) §5.2: In the list of guidelines a difference between "a reasonably fast mechanism" and "a fast mechanism" seems to be made.&nbsp; The implication (from the previous comment) is that a "fast mechanism" is not fast enough (because it is slower that the control plane).&nbsp;  In the context of this section what seems important is the ability to distinguish between a link failure and an egress node failure, or not...and not whether the mechanism is reasonably fast or simply fast.&nbsp; Suggestion: s//PLR has a mechanism<br><br>(10) §5.2: "treating a link failure as an egress node failure MUST NOT have a negative impact on services"&nbsp; How can the PLR figure the impact on the services beforehand?<br><br>(11) §5.3: "each service destination MUST be dual-homed or have dual paths to the egress router and a backup egress router which serves as the protector."&nbsp; I don't think it is a requirement for the backup to always be the protector.&nbsp; s/backup egress router which serves as the protector/backup egress router which may serve as the protector<br><br>(12) §5.4: "A given egress router E MAY be the tailend of multiple tunnels."&nbsp; The MAY is out of place, the sentence just states a fact. s/MAY/may<br><br>(13) "MAY or MAY not" is used a couple of times to show an optional behavior.&nbsp; MAY already means optional.&nbsp;  In all cases in this document I don't think that Normative language is needed. s/MAY or MAY not/may or may not<br><br>(14) §5.6: s/The bypass tunnel MUST have the property that it MUST NOT be affected by the topology change caused by an egress node failure./The bypass tunnel MUST NOT be affected by the topology change caused by an egress node failure.<br><br>(15) s/IPv4/v6/IPv4/IPv6<br><br>(16) §5.7: "The PLR MAY establish the egress-protection bypass tunnel to P in several manners."&nbsp; The MAY is just stating a fact.&nbsp; s/MAY/may<br><br>(17) Please expand UHP.<br><br>(18) §5.8: "The advertisement MUST be understood by the PLR."&nbsp; On one hand, I think this is an obvious statement, and is not needed.&nbsp; On the other hand, I get the feeling that it was included because there is something else to be considered...but I don't know what, and the text doesn't say.&nbsp; If there is something specific to be considered, please write it down.<br><br>(19) §5.8: "The "context ID label binding" advertisement is defined as IGP mirroring context segment in [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>], [SR-OSPF] and [SR-ISIS]."&nbsp; The mirror context segment is not defined for OSPF.<br><br>(20) §5.8: "...care MUST be taken for the applicability of this approach to a network."&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; How can it be Normatively enforced?&nbsp; It would be nice to spell out the potential pitfalls to be taken into account.&nbsp; The sentence right after says that "the feasibility of each approach in a given network as dependent on the topology, manageability, and available protocols of the network."&nbsp; This statement sounds like it should result in guidance (even if general) on when an approach may be applicable.&nbsp; I would like to see that type of guidance somewhere in the document -- the Operational Considerations sections looks ideal to me.<br><br>(21) §5.9: "An egress-protection bypass tunnel MAY be established via several methods:"&nbsp; I think that all the MAYs in the bullets are not needed because of the one at the top.&nbsp; In fact, I think all of them (including the one at the top) just state a fact (not a Normative action).&nbsp; s/MAY/may<br><br>(22) §5.11: "Specific extensions MAY be needed..."&nbsp; Again, just a fact.&nbsp; s/MAY/may'<br><br>(23) §5.11: "The details of the extensions SHOULD be specified in separate documents."&nbsp;

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

The working<br>&nbsp;  group has been made aware of the disclosures both when the<br>&nbsp;  document was adopted as a working document and at wglc.<br>&nbsp;  No concerns has been raised.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp;  The working group is behind this document, it is viewed as a<br>&nbsp;  necessary extension to other MPLS protection mechanisms.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent?

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not make any requests for IANA actions. Maybe<br>&nbsp;  note to the RFC Editor to remove the IANA section before<br>&nbsp;  publication should be added.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  The publication of this document will not change the status of<br>&nbsp;  any other RFC.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not make any requests for IANA actions.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document specifies fast reroute procedures to protect IP/MPLS<br>&nbsp;  services and MPLS tunnels against egress node and egress link<br>&nbsp;  failures. When an egress node failure occurs the penultimate-hop<br>&nbsp;  router of a tunnel acts as the point of local repair (PLR). When<br>&nbsp;  an egress link failure occurs the egress router of the MPLS tunnel<br>&nbsp;  acts as the PLR. In both cases there is a pre-established bypass<br>&nbsp;  tunnel to a protector. Upon an egress node or link failure, the<br>&nbsp;  PLR does local failure detection and local repair. Packets are<br>&nbsp;  re-routed over the bypass tunnel.<br>&nbsp;  The protector performs context label switching or context IP<br>&nbsp;  forwarding to send the packets to the ultimate destination.7<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; This document is the convergence of several initiatives in the IETF<br>&nbsp; and in the industry in general. The working group and more<br>&nbsp; specifically the authors have invested a huge effort to converge on<br>&nbsp; a single solution.<br><br>&nbsp; The list of authors on the title page include 7 names, more than<br>&nbsp; the recommendation of a maximum of 5. The shepherd is personally<br>&nbsp; convinced that the current number of authors should be kept. In<br>&nbsp; discussion between the authors and wg chairs, the authors have<br>&nbsp; agreed on the following motivation why there should be 7 authors<br>&nbsp; listed,<br><br>&nbsp; "The egress protection framework is a generic framework with an<br>&nbsp;  ambition to addresses protection at both transport tunnel level<br>&nbsp;  and service level, and a broad scope to accommodate services and<br>&nbsp;  transport tunnels of any type. In IETF, it has gone through almost<br>&nbsp;  8 years of extensive and cautious study and discussions, and<br>&nbsp;  through many clashes and merges of ideas, it has finally evolved<br>&nbsp;  from a set of separate solutions for individual services (i.e.<br>&nbsp;  PWE3, Layer-3 VPN) to a unified multi-service and multi-transport<br>&nbsp;  architecture. Outside of IETF, it has also involved both hard<br>&nbsp;  development work on the vendor’s side, and bold actions of<br>&nbsp;  deployment on the service provider’s side. Many people have made<br>&nbsp;  a great amount of effort in this long course. There are also<br>&nbsp;  people who helped to promote and shape of the idea of egress<br>&nbsp;  protection, draw attention to this draft, and bring the draft to<br>&nbsp;  this stage. The current list of authors just reflects their effort<br>&nbsp;  and contribution. Without them, it would impossible for the draft<br>&nbsp;  to achieve its current status. Hence, we’d like request to keep<br>&nbsp;  the author list as it is. Thanks for your understanding."<br><br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For<br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or<br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly<br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; It has been a long process, and the initially the positions of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the participants were far from each other. However, the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; discussion to reach consensus has been very contructive and at<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; times slow, and we now have good wg support for the draft.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a<br>&nbsp; significant number of vendors indicated their plan to<br>&nbsp; implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that<br>&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review,<br>&nbsp; e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>&nbsp; conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If<br>&nbsp; there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review,<br>&nbsp; what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type<br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>&nbsp;  We know of both implementations and deployments, as informed<br>&nbsp;  by one major European vendor. We have in addition started an<br>&nbsp;  Implementation Poll and the write-up will be updated as soon<br>&nbsp;  as we get further information.<br><br>&nbsp;  The group that has been working on this has been fairly large<br>&nbsp;  and any reviewer that is worth mentioning is possibly included in<br>&nbsp;  the 15 people listed as authors and in the acknowledgement<br>&nbsp;  section. The MPLS-RT did as usual a good job and together with<br>&nbsp;  the authors nailed down a couple of issues.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd?

Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp;  The working group is behind this document, it is viewed as a<br>&nbsp;  necessary extension to other MPLS protection mechanisms.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document passes the nits tool clean.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No formal reviews required.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes, the references are correctly split into normative and<br>&nbsp;  informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  Of the three normative references one is on "Waiting for<br>&nbsp;  write-up"-state, one is in the RFC Editors queue and draft-<br>&nbsp;  ietf-spring-segment-routing has been published as <a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  However, the document in the RFC Editors queue has a MIS-REF, this<br>&nbsp;  MIS-REF is shared but other documents and the SPRING and MPLS are<br>&nbsp;  working to resolve it.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in<br>the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp;  All the normative references have "Proposed Standard" as intended<br>&nbsp;  status, this should not be construed as downward reference, but it<br>&nbsp;  might take time to get the two remaining documents through to<br>&nbsp;  RFCs.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  The publication of this document will not change the status of<br>&nbsp;  any other RFC.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not make any requests for IANA actions. Maybe<br>&nbsp;  note to the RFC Editor to remove the IANA section before<br>&nbsp;  publication should be added.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  No new IANA registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews and automated checks necessary. </div></td>
