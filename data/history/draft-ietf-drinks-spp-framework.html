You can't have a MUST requirement without a normative reference.<br><br>5.1: I think it's really awful practice to include protocol requirements and syntax definitions inside IANA Considerations. IANA Considerations are for *IANA*, not for the implementer and not for the folks entering items in the registry. I strongly suggest moving the syntax requirements and the ABNF from 11.2 into 5.1 and simply reverse the pointer so that 11.2 points to 5.1.<br><br>5.2: (I'm still trying to figure out how to non-normatively define something. :-) ) Can name attributes really be non-ASCII? Aren't these all protocol elements, not user-interface items? I am icked-out by having to use toCasefold, and having to have a reference to specific Unicode version.<br><br>5.2.1/5.2.2/5.3: I always find this construction bizzarre: "Any conforming specification MUST define...". They're all MUSTs (save a few MAYs in 5.3), and those MUSTs seem pretty unnecessary. For 5.3, you should simply make the opening paragraph:<br><br>&nbsp;  The following table contains the list of response types that a<br>&nbsp;  transport protocol specification needs to provide. An SPPF server<br>&nbsp;  MUST implement all of the following at minimum.<br><br>And then strike "Any conforming specification MUST define a response to indicate that" from all of the entries. Move the MAY bits out of the table, as those aren't part of the description of each of those response types. It'll shorten things up significantly.<br><br>5.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The value for Attribute Value MUST be the value of the data<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; element to which the preceding Attribute Name refers.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Response type "Attribute value invalid" MUST be used whenever an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; element value does not adhere to data validation rules.<br><br>What other choice could an implementation make? In other words, if I were to violate the first MUST, what do you think I'm going to put in to the attribute value that I need to be instructed that I MUST NOT do?<br><br>6.4:<br><br>&nbsp;  hostName: Root-relative host name of the name server.<br><br>The additional term "root-relative" confused me. Are you somehow trying to say that these names MUST NOT have a terminating "." (i.e., they must be relative domain names)? If that's the point, then you should probably say that. Otherwise, I would strike "root-relative". An absolute name (with a terminating ".") should be OK in this context, yes?<br><br>10:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  Where human-readable languages are used in the<br>&nbsp;  protocol, those messages SHOULD be tagged according to [<a href="/doc/rfc5646/">RFC5646</a>]...<br><br>I think you mean that human-readable *messages* that might be displayed to the user are to get language tags, but I don't see anywhere in the spec where you produce human-readable messages. Can you point me to an example. If so, you should probably say:<br><br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Where human-readable messages that are presented to an end user are<br>&nbsp;  used in the protocol, those messages SHOULD be tagged with their<br>&nbsp;  language according to [<a href="/doc/rfc5646/">RFC5646</a>]...<br><br>Also:<br><br>&nbsp;  If tags are absent, the language of the message defaults to "en"<br>&nbsp;  (English).<br><br>That seems like a bad plan. If all of the characters are out of the Arabic script, I'm pretty darn sure that an implicit default language tag of "en" is unlikely to be helpful to an implementation. I would strike that sentence.<br><br>11.2: See comment on section 5.1 above.</div></td>

I would have supported that, but wanted to offer two other data points (in the great tradition of TSV, we argue with people even when we agree with them).<br><br>We are seeing above-layer-four protocols referred to as "transport protocols" in many places. A much-previous IESG used the word "substrate" in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp56">http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp56</a>, "On the use of HTTP as a Substrate". If you wanted to switch terms to "substrate", I'd be fine with that, but I'm not sure that's a commonly understood term of art these days.<br><br>So, a concrete suggestion - you get all the way through Section 4 before you uncloak this text:<br><br>4.11.&nbsp; Mandatory Transport<br><br>&nbsp;  At the time of this writing, a choice of transport protocol has been<br>&nbsp;  provided in SPP Protocol over SOAP document.&nbsp; To encourage<br>&nbsp;  interoperability, the SPPF server MUST provide support for this<br>&nbsp;  transport protocol.&nbsp; With time, it is possible that other transport<br>&nbsp;  layer choices may surface that agree with the requirements discussed<br>&nbsp;  above.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Perhaps you could move this to the front of the line early in Section 4, and add a few words like this:<br><br>&nbsp;  None of the existing transport protocols carried directly over IP,<br>&nbsp;  appearing as "Protocol" in IPv4 headers or "Next Header" in IPv6<br>&nbsp;  headers, meet the requirements for a "transport" listed in this section.<br>&nbsp;  <br>One other quibble about basic terminology. I apologize for spending the last three days talking about IRRs at NANOG 63, but I'd think "Registry" with no qualifier meant something like an IRR in common usage. Would it be possible for you to characterize "registries" with an adjective on first use, in Section 1? I'm not asking for a wholesale terminology swap, of course.<br><br>1.&nbsp; Introduction<br><br>&nbsp;  Service providers and enterprises use routing databases known as<br>&nbsp;  registries to make session routing decisions for Voice over IP, SMS<br>&nbsp;  and MMS traffic exchanges.&nbsp; This document is narrowly focused on the<br>&nbsp;  provisioning framework for these registries.&nbsp; This framework<br>&nbsp;  prescribes a way for an entity to provision session-related data into<br>&nbsp;  a Registry.&nbsp; The data being provisioned can be optionally shared with<br>&nbsp;  other participating peering entities.&nbsp; The requirements and use cases<br>&nbsp;  driving this framework have been documented in [<a href="/doc/rfc6461/">RFC6461</a>].</div></td>

However, SOAP is not a transport protocol in the sense as the rest of the world AFAIK is using the term transport protocol. A transport protocol is a layer 4 protocol and not something that is running on top. <br><br>Can you please change your terminology?<br>Otherwise, all my points below become a DISCUSS, as your requirements basically rule out transport protocols to run over. <br><br>- Section "4.4.&nbsp; Authentication"<br><br>&nbsp;  authenticated SPP Client is a Registrar.&nbsp; Therefore, the SPPF<br>&nbsp;  transport protocol MUST provide means for an SPPF server to<br>&nbsp;  authenticate an SPPF Client.<br><br>This MUST requirement basically lets you without any transport protocol choice left. None to me known transport protocol is supporting the authentication between client and server. Unless you will wait for TCPINC. <br><br>Perhaps you mean this: <br>"Therefore, SPPF MUST leverage appropriate mechanisms provided by underlying protocol layers for an SPPF server to&nbsp; authenticate an SPPF Client". <br><br>This will allow to use TLS which is not a transport protocol, but running on top of it. In case you have a different defintion of transport protocol, it would be good to state this.<br><br><br>- Section "4.6.&nbsp; Confidentiality and Integrity"<br>&nbsp;  Therefore, the transport protocol MUST provide means for<br>&nbsp;  data integrity protection.<br><br>Similar discuss to the point above: None of the IETF transport protocols is providing means for data integrity protection. So you won't ge too far.<br><br>- Section "4.9.&nbsp; Request and Response Correlation":<br><br>Same as the ones before: <br>&nbsp;  A transport protocol suitable for SPPF MUST allow responses to be<br>&nbsp;  correlated with requests.<br><br>TCP, UDP and SCTP will not offer this. <br><br><br><br><br>In Section "4.2.&nbsp; Request and Response Model"<br><br>&nbsp;  Therefore, a transport protocol for SPPF MUST follow the request-<br>&nbsp;  response model by allowing a response to be sent to the request<br>&nbsp;  initiator.<br><br>The last part is worded a bit strange: "allowing a response to be sent..". How about saying "my ensuring a response to be sent to the..."?<br><br>In Section "4.3.&nbsp; Connection Lifetime":<br><br>What is in a quantity short and long-lived? This sentence does not make any sense, unless it is state what a short time period for such a protocol and what a long time period is. <br><br>In Section "Near Real Time"<br>I am not sure how good or bad one can determine if any protocol is reacting in near real-time.

Why is <br>this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title <br>page header?<br><br>&nbsp; Publication as Proposed Standard is being requested. The document <br>&nbsp; specifies a (transport-agnostic) provisioning protocol, including a <br>&nbsp; data and transaction model, hence the WG is in strong concensus that <br>&nbsp; Standards Track is the proper document track.<br><br>&nbsp; The requested type of RFC is included in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement <br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent <br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved <br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; This document specifies the data model and the overall structure for<br>&nbsp; a framework to provision session establishment data into Session Data<br>&nbsp; Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores. The framework is<br>&nbsp; called the Session Peering Provisioning Framework (SPPF). The<br>&nbsp; provisioned data is typically used by network elements<br>&nbsp; for session<br>&nbsp; establishment.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>&nbsp; Given the small size of the working group, particularly towards the <br>&nbsp; end of the document creation process, most of the active WG <br>&nbsp; participants were also part of the Design Team. All issues were <br>&nbsp; discussed extensively in the Design Team to achieve strong consensus. <br>&nbsp; Since the design team represented a vast majority of the active WG <br>&nbsp; participants, the shepherd believes that there is strong concensus by <br>&nbsp; the WG behind the documents.<br><br>&nbsp; During the design process a complete restructuring of the set of <br>&nbsp; documents was performed, in order for the protocol to become transfer-<br>&nbsp; agnostic. Specifically, this was in consideration of an additional<br>&nbsp; future REST-based transport specification.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>&nbsp; A prototype-level implementation was performed by WG participants, <br>&nbsp; involving programmers who were not involved in the protocol <br>&nbsp; specification. Lessons learned from that implementation were fed back <br>&nbsp; into the protocol specification. Furthermore, the Design Team that <br>&nbsp; created the documents included several potential implementers with <br>&nbsp; concrete plans to use the protocol in their networks.<br><br>&nbsp; The design team was in substantive favour of using SOAP as transfer <br>&nbsp; protocol, since this is what target networks currently use for <br>&nbsp; provisioning. However, due to concerns brought to the attention of the <br>&nbsp; group from within as well as outside the working group, significant <br>&nbsp; efforts were undertaken to segregate core („framework“) definitions <br>&nbsp; from the actual transport definition, and hence allow ing for the <br>&nbsp; future definitions of other transport protocols.<br><br>Personnel:<br>&nbsp; Alexander Mayrhofer serves as the Document Shepherd, and Richard <br>&nbsp; Barnes serves as the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by <br>the Document Shepherd . If this version of the document is not ready for <br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the <br>IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd performed a detailed NITS review on version -04, <br>&nbsp; and an additional review on version -05. Subsequent versions only <br>&nbsp; contained minor modifications, and the shepherd performed an <br>&nbsp; additional automated NITS review on version -09. Additionally, the <br>&nbsp; document was reviewed by the same person during WGLC, and many times <br>&nbsp; before that. All issues are believed to be addressed in the latest <br>&nbsp; version of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or&nbsp; breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>&nbsp; Due to the small size of the WG (particularly after splitting off the <br>&nbsp; transport protocol definitions), reviews were mostly performed by the <br>&nbsp; Design Team members themselves. However, during WGLC the WG chairs <br>&nbsp; specifically engaged „outside“ reviewers in order to get „fresh eyes“ <br>&nbsp; on the document. Subsequently, their comments were addressed in <br>&nbsp; document revisions.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from <br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, <br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took <br>place. <br><br>&nbsp; The document contains XML Schema definitions. Even though the Schemas <br>&nbsp; were reviewed and validated by authors / reviewers, the document could <br>&nbsp; benefit from an additional “3rd party” validation of the Schemas.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the <br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable <br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really <br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and <br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those <br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; The document specifies an IANA Registry with just 1 (one) initial <br>&nbsp; entry. Since additional entries are believed to be very infrequent,<br>&nbsp; the IESG’s advice is desired whether to remove that Registry in favour <br>&nbsp; of a „static“ definition with that single entry (and advice that <br>&nbsp; future specifications might want to create an IANA registry <br>&nbsp; themselves).<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR <br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> <br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>&nbsp; Each author has confirmed that there are no IPR claims about the <br>&nbsp; contents of the draft, and that they are not a ware of such claims.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If <br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR <br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp; No IPR claims have been filed.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being <br>silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; Within the Design Team, solid consensus was sought for each issue, and <br>&nbsp; minutes from the weekly conference calls were sent back to the WG <br>&nbsp; mailing list. Due to the small size of the WG, active participants <br>&nbsp; were almost exclusively also part of the Design Team. Therefore, there <br>&nbsp; is solid WG consensus behind the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or other wise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate <br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a <br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No appeal was threatened, nor did anybody indicate extreme discontent.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this <br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts <br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be <br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd performed a detailed NITS review for version <br>&nbsp; -05. Between -05 and the current -09 version, there were (with the <br>&nbsp; exception of adding a formal IANA registry definition) only editorial <br>&nbsp; changes and NITS fixes. <br><br>&nbsp; An automated NITS check was performed on version -09 in order to <br>&nbsp; confirm that all NITS have been fixed.<br><br>&nbsp; The automated NITS check seems to detected one unused reference, <br>&nbsp; however, a manual check confirms that the reference is being used in <br>&nbsp; the text.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review <br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; Besides the basic requirements, the document does not contain any <br>&nbsp; content that is believed to be subject to additional formal review <br>&nbsp; criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either <br>normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes, references have been split in normative an informative <br>&nbsp; references.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for <br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative <br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; All normative references are RFC-level documents.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? <br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in&nbsp; the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; There are no downrefs<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing <br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the <br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed <br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of <br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs <br>is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why <br>the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document will not change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations <br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the <br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes <br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. <br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly <br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a <br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that <br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a <br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The document requests two URN assignments for the XML namespace, and <br>&nbsp; the XML schema, respectively. Those are outlined in the IANA <br>&nbsp; considerations section<br><br>&nbsp; Furthermore, the document specifies a newly created IANA registry that <br>&nbsp; is specified in detail in Section 11.2. The registry contains just a <br>&nbsp; single initial entry. <br><br>&nbsp; A reasonable name, allocation procedures and initial contents of that <br>&nbsp; registry has been specified.<br><br>&nbsp; However, feedback from the IESG is thought with regards to the <br>&nbsp; registry specification of the „SPPF Organization Identifier“. See (6) <br>&nbsp; above for details.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future <br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful <br>in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; See above. The registry specified does not use “Expert Review” as the <br>&nbsp; allocation mechanism.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document <br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal <br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd has performed (besides the manual review) an <br>&nbsp; automated NITS check with idnits 2.13.0. Issues discovered by that <br>&nbsp; check are included in the NITS section above. Furthermore, the <br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd has validated the XML schema using automated tools.<br><br>&nbsp; Furthermore, Ning Zhang has volunteered to perform a review, <br>&nbsp; submitting his results during the IETF LC.<br></div></td>
