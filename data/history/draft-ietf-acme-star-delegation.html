They<br>are not really all editorial, though, as a result.<br><br>I feel like it would be approprate to have a dedicated (sub)section for<br>the delegation objects list, that covers in a little more detail the use<br>of the value in the "delegations" attribute of the Account Object and<br>gives a more prominent home for noting that POST-as-GET to it returns a<br>list of delegations associated with the account.&nbsp; Consider, for example,<br>§7.1.2.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a>.&nbsp; (Such a section would also provide a way to<br>specify how URLs for individual delegation objects are constructed, per<br>the discuss point.)<br><br>Section 1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  CA&nbsp; A Certification Authority that implements the ACME protocol.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this document, the term is synonymous with "ACME server".<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> is careful to distinguish between ACME server and CA, and I'm<br>not sure that we get much value from coalescing the two, here.<br>If we do keep the concepts separate, then we could skip the note in<br>Section 2.1 that points out that ACME server and CA are not the same!<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  This section presents the protocol flow.&nbsp; For completeness, we<br>&nbsp;  include the ACME profile proposed in this document as well as the<br>&nbsp;  extended ACME protocol described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8739/">RFC8739</a>].<br><br>nit: extended with respect to which baseline?<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the interactive identifier authorization phase described in<br>&nbsp;  Section 7.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC8555</a>] is suppressed on the NDC-IdO side because<br>&nbsp;  the delegated identity contained in the CSR presented to the IdO is<br>&nbsp;  validated against the configured CSR template (Section 2.3.1).<br>&nbsp;  Therefore, the NDC sends the finalize request, including the CSR, to<br>&nbsp;  the IdO immediately after Order1 has been acknowledged.&nbsp; The IdO<br>&nbsp;  SHALL buffer a (valid) CSR until the Validation phase completes<br>&nbsp;  successfully.<br><br>I'd consider also noting that the negotiation of the "unauthenticated<br>GET" for the star-certificate URL (per <a href="/doc/rfc8793/">RFC 8793</a>) is required in order<br>for copying the star-certificate URL from Order2 to Order1 to be useful.<br><br>Also, we haven't defined the "validation phase" yet, so a<br>forward-reference might be helpful.<br><br>Section 2.3.1.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  "orders": "<a href="https://example.com/acme/orders/rzGoeA">https://example.com/acme/orders/rzGoeA</a>",<br><br>I recommend not reusing the "orders" URL from <a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> in the example,<br>since the <a href="/doc/rfc8555/">RFC 8555</a> account instance did not have a "delegations"<br>attribute.<br><br>Section 2.3.1.2<br><br>The "cname-map" example is not very enlightening to me.<br>Given the description that the map "name is the delgated identifier" it<br>would seem like the map name is going to be the name that's in the<br>issued cert, i.e., a name in the IdO's control.&nbsp; Logically, then the map<br>value would have to be a name in the NDC's control, with a CNAME in the<br>IdO's zone.&nbsp; The owner name of the CNAME is the delegated identifier and<br>the RDATA of the CNAME is the target name under the NDC's control.&nbsp; But<br>in the example the map name contains both "ndc" and "ido" -- the<br>public-facing delegated name should *not* reference the "ndc", since<br>that name needs to remain valid even if the IdO terminates the<br>delegation and switches to self-hosting or a different CDN.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; cname-map (optional, object): a map of FQDN pairs.&nbsp; In each pair,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the name is the delegated identifier, the value is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; corresponding IdO name that is aliased in the IdO's zone file to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; redirect the resolvers to the delegated entity.&nbsp; Both names and<br><br>nit: this text also confused me at first, since it has a construction of the<br>form "aliased [...] to", but it is not actually of the form "X is<br>aliased to Y" -- instead, it's "X is aliased in order to Y".&nbsp; If we<br>could instead refer to it as a "target" (or maybe just add the "in order<br>to" phrasing), I think that would help readability.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "subject": {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "country": "CA",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "stateOrProvince": "**",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "locality": "**",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "commonName": "**"<br><br>It's not clear to me that it's a useful example to have stateOrProvince<br>and locality be mandatory, and to have the value of commonName left up<br>to the client.&nbsp;

 possibility ("*") to define the delegated domain name by itself.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  this is the case, the IdO needs to have a further layer of checks on<br>&nbsp;  top of the control rules already provided by the CSR template to<br>&nbsp;

The "delegation" field is currently attached to the "identifier" object, which is a bad semantic fit in a few ways. ACME orders can have multiple identifiers, and delegations can describe multiple SAN values, yet this design assumes singularity on both sides. This field should be moved to the order object; in fact, if you wanted to be more radical, you could even use it to replace the "identifiers" field in the newOrder request.<br><br>2. The "allow-certificate-get" field is listed as configurable. It seems like this is a matter of CA policy, so it should either be non-configurable, or if you allow the client to request a value for it, there should be a clear specification that the server is allowed to ignore the client's preference.</div></td>
