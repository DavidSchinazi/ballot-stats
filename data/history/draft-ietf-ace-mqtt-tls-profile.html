If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction. <br><br>&nbsp;  This document specifies a profile for the ACE (Authentication and<br>&nbsp;  Authorization for Constrained Environments) framework to enable<br>&nbsp;  authorization in an Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)-based<br>&nbsp;  publish-subscribe messaging system.&nbsp; Proof-of-possession keys, bound<br>&nbsp;  to OAuth2.0 access tokens, are used to authenticate and authorize<br>&nbsp;  MQTT Clients.&nbsp; The protocol relies on TLS for confidentiality and<br>&nbsp;  MQTT server (broker) authentication.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>Nothing was special. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are at least two known implementations:<br> * Implementation using the HiveMQ CE is a Java-based open source MQTT broker that fully supports MQTT 3.x and MQTT 5.  <br><a href="https://github.com/michaelg9/HiveACEclient">https://github.com/michaelg9/HiveACEclient</a>  <br>* The Mosquitto prototype was only v3.1.1: <a href="https://github.com/ciseng/ace-mqtt-mosquitto">https://github.com/ciseng/ace-mqtt-mosquitto</a><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>None<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The document went through several rounds of reviews. Though I came while the document was already a WG document. I have the impression that the number of reviewers were around 4.&nbsp;  <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>There are at least two known implementations:<br> * Implementation using the HiveMQ CE is a Java-based open source MQTT broker that fully supports MQTT 3.x and MQTT 5.  <br><a href="https://github.com/michaelg9/HiveACEclient">https://github.com/michaelg9/HiveACEclient</a>  <br>* The Mosquitto prototype was only v3.1.1: <a href="https://github.com/ciseng/ace-mqtt-mosquitto">https://github.com/ciseng/ace-mqtt-mosquitto</a><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?
