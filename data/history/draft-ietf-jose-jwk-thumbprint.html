Why is this the proper type of <br>RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>The document is being requested for publication as a Proposed Standard.&nbsp; The <br>document is the consensus of the working group, but the working group was <br>somewhat ambivalent on which publication track to pursue. It could be argued that <br>this is just an algorithm description and thus should be Informational. In the end, <br>the working group maintained the current approach of Proposed Standard, but the <br>working group is willing to defer to the IESG if they prefer another approach. <br> <br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-<br>Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can <br>be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval <br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary: <br><br>This document defines a method for computing a hash value over a JSON Web Key <br>structure.&nbsp; The document describes what the subset of fields in a key to be used are, <br>the method of creating a canonical form for those fields, and how to convert the <br>resulting UNICODE string into a byte sequence appropriate for hashing.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document has clear working group consensus for publication, and has been <br>reviewed by several WG participants since its initial adoption as a working group <br>item. There was some discussion over the form and content of the string to be <br>hashed.&nbsp; Some people advocated for the use of the current X.509 SPKI structure and <br>some over use a string that was not a JSON structure.&nbsp; This discussion ended without <br>conclusion and thus the original proposal advanced.<br><br>Document Quality:<br> <br>This document has been reviewed and revised a few times. Several individuals from <br>the OpenID Connect community have indicated that they have implemented the <br>protocol. <br> <br>Personnel: <br><br>Karen O'Donoghue is acting as the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; Kathleen Moriarty is the <br>Responsible Area Director. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, <br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br> <br>The document shepherd has followed the working group process and reviewed the <br>final document and feels this document is ready for IESG review. <br><br> (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br> <br>The document shepherd does not have any concerns about the reviews that were <br>performed. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The scope of the document is currently limited to the JSON Web documents from the <br>JOSE working group.&nbsp; As such there has been sufficient review for this purpose.&nbsp; In <br>the event that there is a push to use something such as DANE with this element, it <br>might need more review both on the content and the question of the use a hash of <br>the SPKI structure instead.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with <br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware <br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the <br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the <br>WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the <br>document, detail those concerns here.<br> <br>The Document Shepherd is comfortable with this document as a stable specification. <br>This specification has been implemented and adopted in some communities (most <br>especially OpenID). The only issue here is the question of what the correct <br>serialization content is and if sufficient fields have been included.&nbsp; The people who <br>are planning to use the item immediately are comfortable with the content. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required <br>for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been <br>filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that they have no relevant IPR disclosures.<br> <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize <br>any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There are no IPR disclosures filed for this document. <br> <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as <br>a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document represents a solid if somewhat ambivalent WG consensus. The <br>document meets an immediate need of the community currently using the JOSE <br>specifications. <br> <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If <br>so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. <br><br>There have been no threats of anyone appealing the documents.<br> <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

Why is this the proper type of <br>RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>The document is being requested for publication as a Proposed Standard.&nbsp; The <br>document is the consensus of the working group, but the working group was <br>somewhat ambivalent on which publication track to pursue. It could be argued that <br>this is just an algorithm description and thus should be Informational. In the end, <br>the working group maintained the current approach of Proposed Standard, but the <br>working group is willing to defer to the IESG if they prefer another approach. <br> <br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-<br>Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can <br>be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval <br>announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary: <br><br>This document defines a method for computing a hash value over a JSON Web Key <br>structure.&nbsp; The document describes what the subset of fields in a key to be used are, <br>the method of creating a canonical form for those fields, and how to convert the <br>resulting UNICODE string into a byte sequence appropriate for hashing.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document has clear working group consensus for publication, and has been <br>reviewed by several WG participants since its initial adoption as a working group <br>item. There was some discussion over the form and content of the string to be <br>hashed.&nbsp; Some people advocated for the use of the current X.509 SPKI structure and <br>some over use a string that was not a JSON structure.&nbsp; This discussion ended without <br>conclusion and thus the original proposal advanced.<br><br>Document Quality:<br> <br>This document has been reviewed and revised a few times. Several individuals from <br>the OpenID Connect community have indicated that they have implemented the <br>protocol. <br> <br>Personnel: <br><br>Karen O'Donoghue is acting as the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; Kathleen Moriarty is the <br>Responsible Area Director. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, <br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br> <br>The document shepherd has followed the working group process and reviewed the <br>final document and feels this document is ready for IESG review. <br><br> (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br> <br>The document shepherd does not have any concerns about the reviews that were <br>performed. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The scope of the document is currently limited to the JSON Web documents from the <br>JOSE working group.&nbsp; As such there has been sufficient review for this purpose.&nbsp; In <br>the event that there is a push to use something such as DANE with this element, it <br>might need more review both on the content and the question of the use a hash of <br>the SPKI structure instead.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with <br>this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware <br>of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the <br>document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the <br>WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the <br>document, detail those concerns here.<br> <br>The Document Shepherd is comfortable with this document as a stable specification. <br>This specification has been implemented and adopted in some communities (most <br>especially OpenID). The only issue here is the question of what the correct <br>serialization content is and if sufficient fields have been included.&nbsp; The people who <br>are planning to use the item immediately are comfortable with the content. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required <br>for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been <br>filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>All authors have confirmed that they have no relevant IPR disclosures.<br> <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize <br>any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There are no IPR disclosures filed for this document. <br> <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as <br>a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document represents a solid if somewhat ambivalent WG consensus. The <br>document meets an immediate need of the community currently using the JOSE <br>specifications. <br> <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If <br>so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. <br><br>There have been no threats of anyone appealing the documents.<br> <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <br><a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate <br>checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>The document shepherd has talked to the editor about the brevity of the abstract. A <br>slightly more detailed abstract will be added during the next revision cycle, but it <br>wasn’t deemed necessary to hold up the IESG review for that addition. <br><br>ID nits were checked on the -05 version of the document.
