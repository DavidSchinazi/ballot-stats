I<br>tried to remove comments about things fixed in the -25 or -26, but may<br>have missed a couple; please ignore any such already-addressed comments.<br>There are also a couple points that we have already been discussing in<br>the other thread but I retain as a "placeholder"; hopefully we can keep<br>the actual discussion about them in just one place.]<br><br>As mentioned in the Discuss section, I did a lot of background reading<br>while preparing this updated ballot position.&nbsp; Another thing I noticed<br>while doing that reading is that the pseudocode in<br><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8754#section-4.3.1.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8754#section-4.3.1.1</a> explicitly mentions<br>"perform TLV processing"; we might consider repeating that step in our<br>pseudocode procedures, and otherwise making our procedures as analogous<br>as possible to the <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> procedures, just from the perspective of<br>keeping the writing style as consistent as possible across the related<br>documents.&nbsp; However, that's entirely an editorial matter and thus left<br>to the discretion of the authors/AD.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  The following terms used within this document are defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>]: SRH, SR Source Node, Transit Node, SR Segment Endpoint<br>&nbsp;  Node, Reduced SRH, Segments Left and Last Entry.<br><br>It's slightly unfortunate that 8754 didn't have a dedicated terminology<br>section containing these, though it's too late to really do anything<br>about it now.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The term "function" refers to the bit-string in the SRv6 SID.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  term "behavior" identifies the behavior bound to the SID.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  behaviors are defined in Section 4 of this document.<br><br>(nit) using "the behaviors" to some extent implies that these are the<br>only ones allowed or defined, which is not true.&nbsp; Perhaps "some<br>behaviors" would be more accurate (or some other phrasing would also<br>cover the expected evolution of the ecosystem)?<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  A packet could be steered to a non-routed SID 2001:db8:b:2:101:: by<br>&nbsp;  using a SID list &lt;...,2001:db8:b:1:100::,2001:db8:b:2:101::,...&gt;<br>&nbsp;  where the non-routed SID is preceded by a routed SID to the same<br>&nbsp;  node.&nbsp; Routed and non-routed SRv6 SIDs are the SRv6 instantiation of<br>&nbsp;  global and local segments, respectively [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>].<br><br>If it's (also) possible to steer a packet to a non-routed SID without a<br>preceding routed SID for the same node (e.g., via End.X), it seems like<br>that might be worth listing an example of as well.&nbsp; Otherwise a reader<br>might assume that the global segment is a necessary part of using the<br>non-routed SID.<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp; End.DT2U&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Endpoint with decaps and unicast MAC L2table lookup<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  e.g. EVPN Bridging unicast use-case<br><br>(nit) we seem to put a space in "L2 table" the other times it appears.<br><br>&nbsp;  The list is not exhaustive.&nbsp; In practice, any function can be<br>&nbsp;  attached to a local SID: e.g. a node N can bind a SID to a local VM<br>&nbsp;  or container which can apply any complex processing on the packet.<br><br>(nit) the preceding list was a list of well-known behaviors, not a list<br>of functions.&nbsp; IIUC, it is more appropriate to use "behavior" here than<br>"function", since the "function" is just the opaque bitstring.<br><br>Section 4.1.1, ...<br><br>&nbsp;  When processing the Upper-layer Header of a packet matching a FIB<br>&nbsp;  entry locally instantiated as an SRv6 End SID do the following:<br><br>(editorial, I think) I find it interesting to compare the phrasing here<br>to what was used in §4.1 (when processing an SRH), where the text is<br>"receives a packet whose IPv6 DA is S and S is a local End SID".&nbsp; Why<br>the distinction between "End SID" and 'SRv6 End SID"?&nbsp; IIUC the<br>distinction between checking "IPv6 DA" and "matching a FIB entry locally<br>instantiated" is important and the language should not be harmonized<br>between occurrences.<br>The "..." in the Section number listing indicates that this (or similar)<br>phrasing appears throughout, whenever we talk about processing an<br>upper-layer header.<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that if N has an outgoing interface bundle I to a neighbor Q<br>&nbsp;  made of 10 member links, N may allocate up to 11 End.X local SIDs:<br>&nbsp;  one for the bundle itself and then up to one for each Layer-2 member<br>&nbsp;  link.&nbsp; The flows steered using the End.X SID corresponding to the<br><br>(nit) I think that while "up to 11" might be the situation that makes<br>the most sense (in that having many distinct subgroups with 1 &lt; n &lt; 10<br>member links doesn't make sense), it is not strictly speaking a physical<br>or protocol requirement.&nbsp; Perhaps "might allocate 11" is better than<br>"may allocate up to 11" for that reason.<br><br>Section 4.4, ...<br><br>&nbsp;  When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.DX6 SID,<br>&nbsp;  N does the following processing:<br><br>(nit) we have a mismatch of "N does the following processing" (like<br>appears here) and "N does" or similar; it is probably worth normalizing<br>on one phrasing.<br><br>&nbsp;  When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB<br>&nbsp;  entry locally instantiated as an SRv6 End.DX6 SID, the following is<br>&nbsp;  done:<br><br>Similarly here, we use "the following is done" but the "N does the<br>following" phrasing used in some other sections is probably preferred,<br>as it avoids the passive voice.<br><br>Section 4.12<br><br>We might give some mnemonic explanation for how the name "FE2" was<br>chosen to identify the argument value.<br><br>&nbsp;  table T flooding.&nbsp; The allocation of the argument values is local to<br>&nbsp;  the SR Endpoint Node instantiating this behavior and the signaling of<br>&nbsp;  the argument to other nodes for the EVPN functionality via control<br>&nbsp;  plane.<br><br>nit(?): s/via control plane/occurs via the control plane/?<br><br>Section 4.13<br><br>&nbsp; S05.&nbsp;  If (IPv6 Hop Limit &lt;= 1) {<br>&nbsp; S06.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),<br><br>(nit) the indentation seems off by one space in the first line of S06<br>(it doesn't match the other two places where this chunk occurs).<br><br>&nbsp;  S14.&nbsp; The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy B only contains one<br>&nbsp;  SID and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.<br>&nbsp;  S17.&nbsp; The Payload Length, Traffic Class, Hop Limit and Next-Header<br>&nbsp;  fields are set as per [<a href="/doc/rfc2473/">RFC2473</a>].&nbsp; The Flow Label is computed as per<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6437/">RFC6437</a>].<br><br>(These look to be S15 and S18, respectively, now.)<br><br>Section 4.14<br><br>&nbsp;  The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains one segment<br>&nbsp;  and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.<br><br>(nit) it's probably worth harmonizing the phrasing between here and the<br>note on S15 in §4.13 (specifically, "only contains one SID" vs "only<br>contains one segment").<br><br>Section 4.15<br><br>(nit) there's a blank line at the end of S06 that doesn't occur in the<br>other two locations where this pseudocode appears.<br><br>&nbsp; S16.&nbsp;  Submit the packet to the MPLS engine for transmission to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; topmost label.<br><br>(nit) I suggest rewording slightly so as to not imply that the node to<br>transmit to is determined by the topmost label -- IIUC it's determined<br>by the MPLS policy, since the interpretation of the label is in general<br>local to the receiving node.<br><br>Section 4.16.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  As a reminder, [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] defines in section 5 the SR Deployment Model<br>&nbsp;  within the SR Domain [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>].&nbsp; Within this framework, the<br>&nbsp;  Authentication Header (AH) is not used to secure the SRH as described<br>&nbsp;  in Section 7.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>].<br><br>(repeating from the previous thread as a placeholder) I think we need<br>another sentence or clause here to clarify why this statement is<br>relevant, e.g., "Thus, while the AH can detect changes to the IPv6<br>header chain, it will not be used in combination with the SRH, so use of<br>PSP will not cause delivery failure due to AH validation checks."<br><br>Section 5<br><br>(editorial) This is the first place in the document that we talk about<br>the "headend" or its policy at all, so a bit of background on why it's<br>useful to tabulate potential headend policy/behaviors might be helpful.<br><br>Section 5.x<br><br>Tying the other policies more precisely to the pseudocode for H.Encaps<br>(e.g., replacing S01) seems like it would be useful, to avoid the<br>appearance of specifying behavior by appealing to examples.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note:<br>&nbsp;  S03: As described in [<a href="/doc/rfc6437/">RFC6437</a>] (IPv6 Flow Label Specification).<br><br>We need to pull in <a href="/doc/rfc2473/">RFC 2473</a> for payload length, traffic class, and<br>next-header, IIUC.&nbsp; (hop-limit is covered a few paragraphs down.) Also<br>to say how the next-header value is selected.<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The presence of SIDs in the IGP does not imply any routing semantics<br>&nbsp;  to the addresses represented by these SIDs.&nbsp; The routing reachability<br>&nbsp;  to an IPv6 address is solely governed by the non-SID-related IGP<br>&nbsp;  prefix reachability information that includes locators.&nbsp; Routing is<br>&nbsp;  neither governed nor influenced in any way by a SID advertisement in<br>&nbsp;  the IGP.<br><br>It seems like this is trying to say "the IGP must not advertise prefixes<br>contained within the LOC part of an SID", but in a very roundabout way.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The End.DX4, End.DX6, End.DT4, End.DT6, End.DT46, End.DX2, End.DX2V,<br>&nbsp;  End.DT2U and End.DT2M SIDs can be signaled in BGP.<br><br>Since we said earlier that the signaling of SIDs needs to include the<br>behavior codepoint for each function bitstring, it seems like we should<br>provide a reference to how BGP will encode the behavior codepoint.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>There seem to be some security considerations relating to the use of<br>PSP, in that the egress node loses visibility into which policy was used<br>for a given packet, so all packets from all policies that egress via<br>that SID are in the same anonymity (and policy!) set.&nbsp; In particular,<br>even if an HMAC TLV was present in the SRH, it is not available and<br>cannot be validated.&nbsp; I recognize that the headend (or whatever entity<br>is assigning SR policy) should know when such validation would be<br>intended to occur and not assign a policy incompatible with it, but<br>there are still new considerations in the sense that the headend needs<br>to be aware of these considerations.<br><br>(repeating as a placeholder from the previous thread) I think we should<br>also say that in the absence of the HMAC TLV, valid FUNC and ARG values<br>on any given node may be guessable and spoofable, along with the<br>standard disclaimer that risks are minimal since all nodes in the SR<br>domain are assumed to be trusted.&nbsp; This is distinct from the<br>already-extant ability to spoof a SID in that the underlying structure<br>in the SID may allow the attacker to induce behavior that was never<br>intended to be a SID, for example if the implementation logically<br>separates FUNC and ARG processing and the attacker makes a combination<br>that was never advertised.<br><br>Also, IIUC, the "Segments Left == 0" handling for, e.g., End.X is<br>important to prevent traffic loops -- if a node fails to perform that<br>check and blindly sends the packet to the interconnect it will get<br>returned to that node/SID and loop until the IP hop limit is exhausted.</div></td>

 Note that if N has an outgoing interface bundle I to a neighbor Q<br>&nbsp;  made of 10 member links, N may allocate up to 11 End.X local SIDs:<br>&nbsp;  one for the bundle itself and then up to one for each Layer-2 member<br>&nbsp;  link.&nbsp; The flows steered using the End.X SID corresponding to the<br><br>(nit) I think that while "up to 11" might be the situation that makes<br>the most sense (in that having many distinct subgroups with 1 &lt; n &lt; 10<br>member links doesn't make sense), it is not strictly speaking a physical<br>or protocol requirement.&nbsp; Perhaps "might allocate 11" is better than<br>"may allocate up to 11" for that reason.<br><br>Section 4.4, ...<br><br>&nbsp;  When N receives a packet destined to S and S is a local End.DX6 SID,<br>&nbsp;  N does the following processing:<br><br>(nit) we have a mismatch of "N does the following processing" (like<br>appears here) and "N does" or similar; it is probably worth normalizing<br>on one phrasing.<br><br>&nbsp;  When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB<br>&nbsp;  entry locally instantiated as an SRv6 End.DX6 SID, the following is<br>&nbsp;  done:<br><br>Similarly here, we use "the following is done" but the "N does the<br>following" phrasing used in some other sections is probably preferred,<br>as it avoids the passive voice.<br><br>Section 4.12<br><br>We might give some mnemonic explanation for how the name "FE2" was<br>chosen to identify the argument value.<br><br>&nbsp;  table T flooding.&nbsp; The allocation of the argument values is local to<br>&nbsp;  the SR Endpoint Node instantiating this behavior and the signaling of<br>&nbsp;  the argument to other nodes for the EVPN functionality via control<br>&nbsp;  plane.<br><br>nit(?): s/via control plane/occurs via the control plane/?<br><br>Section 4.13<br><br>&nbsp; S05.&nbsp;  If (IPv6 Hop Limit &lt;= 1) {<br>&nbsp; S06.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),<br><br>(nit) the indentation seems off by one space in the first line of S06<br>(it doesn't match the other two places where this chunk occurs).<br><br>&nbsp;  S14.&nbsp; The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy B only contains one<br>&nbsp;  SID and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.<br>&nbsp;  S17.&nbsp; The Payload Length, Traffic Class, Hop Limit and Next-Header<br>&nbsp;  fields are set as per [<a href="/doc/rfc2473/">RFC2473</a>].&nbsp; The Flow Label is computed as per<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6437/">RFC6437</a>].<br><br>(These look to be S15 and S18, respectively, now.)<br><br>Section 4.14<br><br>&nbsp;  The SRH MAY be omitted when the SRv6 Policy only contains one segment<br>&nbsp;  and there is no need to use any flag, tag or TLV.<br><br>(nit) it's probably worth harmonizing the phrasing between here and the<br>note on S15 in §4.13 (specifically, "only contains one SID" vs "only<br>contains one segment").<br><br>Section 4.15<br><br>(nit) there's a blank line at the end of S06 that doesn't occur in the<br>other two locations where this pseudocode appears.<br><br>&nbsp; S16.&nbsp;  Submit the packet to the MPLS engine for transmission to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; topmost label.<br><br>(nit) I suggest rewording slightly so as to not imply that the node to<br>transmit to is determined by the topmost label -- IIUC it's determined<br>by the MPLS policy, since the interpretation of the label is in general<br>local to the receiving node.<br><br>Section 4.16.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  As a reminder, [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] defines in section 5 the SR Deployment Model<br>&nbsp;  within the SR Domain [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>].&nbsp; Within this framework, the<br>&nbsp;  Authentication Header (AH) is not used to secure the SRH as described<br>&nbsp;  in Section 7.5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>].<br><br>(repeating from the previous thread as a placeholder) I think we need<br>another sentence or clause here to clarify why this statement is<br>relevant, e.g., "Thus, while the AH can detect changes to the IPv6<br>header chain, it will not be used in combination with the SRH, so use of<br>PSP will not cause delivery failure due to AH validation checks."<br><br>Section 5<br><br>(editorial) This is the first place in the document that we talk about<br>the "headend" or its policy at all, so a bit of background on why it's<br>useful to tabulate potential headend policy/behaviors might be helpful.<br><br>Section 5.x<br><br>Tying the other policies more precisely to the pseudocode for H.Encaps<br>(e.g., replacing S01) seems like it would be useful, to avoid the<br>appearance of specifying behavior by appealing to examples.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note:<br>&nbsp;  S03: As described in [<a href="/doc/rfc6437/">RFC6437</a>] (IPv6 Flow Label Specification).<br><br>We need to pull in <a href="/doc/rfc2473/">RFC 2473</a> for payload length, traffic class, and<br>next-header, IIUC.&nbsp; (hop-limit is covered a few paragraphs down.) Also<br>to say how the next-header value is selected.<br><br>Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The presence of SIDs in the IGP does not imply any routing semantics<br>&nbsp;  to the addresses represented by these SIDs.&nbsp; The routing reachability<br>&nbsp;  to an IPv6 address is solely governed by the non-SID-related IGP<br>&nbsp;  prefix reachability information that includes locators.&nbsp; Routing is<br>&nbsp;  neither governed nor influenced in any way by a SID advertisement in<br>&nbsp;  the IGP.<br><br>It seems like this is trying to say "the IGP must not advertise prefixes<br>contained within the LOC part of an SID", but in a very roundabout way.<br><br>Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The End.DX4, End.DX6, End.DT4, End.DT6, End.DT46, End.DX2, End.DX2V,<br>&nbsp;  End.DT2U and End.DT2M SIDs can be signaled in BGP.<br><br>Since we said earlier that the signaling of SIDs needs to include the<br>behavior codepoint for each function bitstring, it seems like we should<br>provide a reference to how BGP will encode the behavior codepoint.<br><br>Section 9<br><br>There seem to be some security considerations relating to the use of<br>PSP, in that the egress node loses visibility into which policy was used<br>for a given packet, so all packets from all policies that egress via<br>that SID are in the same anonymity (and policy!) set.&nbsp; In particular,<br>even if an HMAC TLV was present in the SRH, it is not available and<br>cannot be validated.&nbsp; I recognize that the headend (or whatever entity<br>is assigning SR policy) should know when such validation would be<br>intended to occur and not assign a policy incompatible with it, but<br>there are still new considerations in the sense that the headend needs<br>to be aware of these considerations.<br><br>(repeating as a placeholder from the previous thread) I think we should<br>also say that in the absence of the HMAC TLV, valid FUNC and ARG values<br>on any given node may be guessable and spoofable, along with the<br>standard disclaimer that risks are minimal since all nodes in the SR<br>domain are assumed to be trusted.&nbsp; This is distinct from the<br>already-extant ability to spoof a SID in that the underlying structure<br>in the SID may allow the attacker to induce behavior that was never<br>intended to be a SID, for example if the implementation logically<br>separates FUNC and ARG processing and the attacker makes a combination<br>that was never advertised.<br><br>Also, IIUC, the "Segments Left == 0" handling for, e.g., End.X is<br>important to prevent traffic loops -- if a node fails to perform that<br>check and blindly sends the packet to the interconnect it will get<br>returned to that node/SID and loop until the IP hop limit is exhausted.</div></td>

It would be disappointing to have a PS refer to a draft that<br>squats on the IPv4 namespace in such a manner.<br><br>Abstract, Introduction<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and<br>&nbsp;  specifies the base set of SRv6 behaviors that enables the creation of<br>&nbsp;  interoperable overlays with underlay optimization (Service Level<br>&nbsp;  Agreements).<br><br>I don't understand what the parenthetical is intending to convey.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  The following terms used within this document are defined in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC8402</a>]: Segment Routing, SR Domain, Segment ID (SID), SRv6, SRv6<br>&nbsp;  SID, SR Policy, Prefix SID, and Adjacency SID.<br><br>[<a href="/doc/rfc8402/">RFC 8402</a> spells it Prefix-SID (with hyphen) and Adj-SID.]<br><br>Section 3<br><br>The text allegedly reproduced from <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a> §4.3 differs in case and<br>hyphenation.<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  This document defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG,<br>&nbsp;  where a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of<br>&nbsp;  the SID, followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of<br>&nbsp;  arguments (ARG).&nbsp; L, the locator length, is flexible, and an operator<br>&nbsp;  is free to use the locator length of their choice.&nbsp; F and A may be<br>&nbsp;  any value as long as L+F+A &lt;= 128.&nbsp; When L+F+A is less than 128 then<br>&nbsp;  the remaining bits of the SID MUST be zero.<br><br>Why does A have to be a fixed value; can't it safely be a function of F<br>(even if we exclude things like huffman coding for F)?<br><br>&nbsp;  An SRv6 Segment Endpoint Behavior may require additional information<br>&nbsp;  for its processing (e.g. related to the flow or service).&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  information may be encoded in the ARG bits of the SID.<br><br>(Assuming that it can be sufficiently compactly encoded?)<br><br>&nbsp;  The ARG value of a routed SID SHOULD remain constant among packets in<br>&nbsp;  a given flow.&nbsp; Varying ARG values among packets in a flow may result<br><br>(Thus limiting the type of information that can be represented in the<br>ARG?)<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  SIDs.&nbsp; The provider historically deployed IPv6 and assigned<br>&nbsp;  infrastructure addresses from a portion of the fc00::/7 prefix.&nbsp; They<br>&nbsp;  further subdivided the prefix into three /48 prefixes (Country X,<br>&nbsp;  Country Y, Country Z) to support their SRv6 infrastructure.&nbsp; From<br>&nbsp;  those /48 prefixes each router is assigned a /64 prefix from which<br>&nbsp;  all SIDs of that router are allocated.<br><br>This is not the language I would have expected for use of the ULA<br>address range.&nbsp; It looks like this may be related to Erik Kline's<br>Discuss point...<br><br>&nbsp;  IPv6 address consumption in both these examples is minimal,<br>&nbsp;  representing one billionth and one millionth of the assigned address<br>&nbsp;  space, respectively.<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the calculation that produced these values.<br><br>&nbsp;  An SR Source Node cannot infer the behavior by examination of the<br>&nbsp;  FUNCT value of a SID.<br><br>&nbsp;  Therefore, the SRv6 Endpoint Behavior codepoint is advertised along<br>&nbsp;  with the SID in the control plane.<br><br>These two sentences feel a little out of place in this spot, occurring<br>after previous discussion that the endpoint behavior codepoint is<br>advertised in the control plane.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; At Router 3, within the locator 2001:db8:bbbb:3::/64, network<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; operator or the router performs dynamic assignment for:<br><br>nit: missing article ("the network operator").<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Function 100 associated with the behavior End.X (Endpoint with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  cross-connect) between router 3 and its connected neighbor<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  router, for example Router 4.&nbsp; This function is encoded as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  16-bit value and has no arguments.<br><br>Please clarify that "function 100" is a hex literal.<br><br>I also suggest noting clearly at the start of the example that F is 16<br>and A is 0.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; Function 101 associated with the behavior End.X (Endpoint with<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  cross-connect) between router 3 and its connected neighbor<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  router, for example Router 2.&nbsp; This function is encoded as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  16-bit value and has no arguments.<br><br>F is a constant for the SR domain; saying it at each SID assignment is<br>misleading.<br><br>[same note about hex for 101]<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;

The part in brackets is not spelled out very clearly and<br>could well be expounded upon in this document.&nbsp; I can write up some<br>(very ad hoc) ideas for what I had in mind, which you are welcome to<br>adopt but expected to wordsmith/edit appropriately:<br><br>% Section 5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] describes the SR deployment model and the<br>% baseline requirements for securing the SR Domain.&nbsp; In many ways the SR<br>% Domain is analogous to an MPLS domain -- it's a tightly controlled<br>% system where packet processing is controlled by a list (or stack) of<br>% opaque identifiers that, by and large, only have defined semantics in<br>% the context of the node that receives and processes the packet when<br>% that identifier is "topmost" or "current".&nbsp; Experience in securing and<br>% operating MPLS domains should be readily transferrable to SRv6<br>% domains, in ensuring that all traffic within the network is tightly<br>% controlled, with all external inputs being properly encapsulated (for<br>% SRv6, by an IPv6 header usually with SRH; for MPLS, by the label<br>% stack).&nbsp; The dedicated format for the MPLS label stack and label<br>% identifiers makes a clear mechanical separation between "internal" and<br>% "external" identifiers. In contrast, SRv6 uses SIDs for the internal<br>% identifiers, which have format and operation of IPv6 addresses.&nbsp; While<br>% this lets SRv6 benefit from IP longest-prefix routing and thus the<br>% structure of SID values, it also means that there is not a crisp<br>% mechanical separation between "internal" and "external" identifiers.<br>% As such, care and rigor in annotating which IPv6 addresses/headers are<br>% internal vs external is required in order to maintain the integrity<br>% and security of the SRv6 domain.<br><br>There might also be room for discussion (in the main body of the<br>document) of how the various decapsulation procedures occur precisely<br>when the packet is leaving the SR Domain.<br><br>Having the ARG structure specified as part of the behavior codepoint<br>registration means that a node that can apply that SID can also spoof<br>the ARG to force a different (e.g.) outgoing interface list.<br>Specifically, it gives the attacker a degree of freedom greater than<br>just the SID behaviors that the node advertises.&nbsp; The HMAC TLV would<br>mitigate this to the extent that it limits what SIDs the node in<br>question is allowed to apply and what changes can be made on-path.<br><br>&nbsp;  services.&nbsp; Additionally, [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] defines an HMAC TLV permitting SR<br>&nbsp;  Endpoint Nodes in the SR domain to verify that the SRH applied to a<br>&nbsp;  packet was selected by an authorized party and to ensure that the<br>&nbsp;  segment list is not modified after generation, regardless of the<br>&nbsp;  number of segments in the segment list.&nbsp; When enabled by local<br><br>I suggest adding a sentence similar to "(This does, however, require<br>that the segment list, and thus, the SRH is present in the packet; the<br>optional ability to elide the SRH when there is only a single segment<br>and no flags, tags, or TLVs needed inherently excludes the protection of<br>the HMAC TLV.)"<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>&nbsp;  definition: The value 143 in the Next Header field of an IPv6 header<br>&nbsp;  or any extension header indicates that the payload is an Ethernet<br>&nbsp;  [IEEE.802.3_2018].<br><br>nit: is there a missing word here ("frame"?)?</div></td>

As written, I am not sure if the intent is to process any upper-layer header or only specific ones.&nbsp; Is the objective for this operation to be similar to the one in §4.3.1.2/rfc8754?&nbsp; Please be specific on what is meant by "allowed by local configuration".<br><br>[Note: this point by itself is not DISCUSS-worthy, but §4.1.1 is used, for different reasons, in some of the other items I point to below.&nbsp; That is why I include it here.]<br><br><br>(1c) §4.4/§4.6: S01 of the second piece of pseudocode is an instruction for processing a non-IPv6 upper header.&nbsp; However, earlier in that section, it is specified that the SID "is associated with one or more L3 IPv6 adjacencies/an IPv6 FIB table".&nbsp;

list.<br><br>Let's assume a router has 10 possible OIFs, and the operator uses 4-bit values to identify them; then, the ARG would take 40 bits of the SID.&nbsp; Is that how the math works?<br><br>Assuming my interpretation is correct, for 20 OIFs and 5-bit values we would need 100 bits.&nbsp; Considering the examples in §3.2, where a /64 is allocated to a router, this behavior wouldn't have enough bits!&nbsp; I realize that maybe a better encoding would be to use a 20-bit field, each representing an interface.&nbsp; However, there would still be a limit of &lt; 64 OIFs.&nbsp; Am I missing something?<br><br>I'm trying to ultimately get to the fact that there are limits to this behavior, but they are not described in the document.&nbsp; Please clearly explain any limitations and any possible workaround.<br><br><br><br>(3) The description of the flavors in §4.16 is also unclear.<br><br>The section starts with this introduction:<br><br>&nbsp;  The PSP, USP and USD flavors are variants of the End, End.X and End.T<br>&nbsp;  behaviors.&nbsp; For each of these behaviors these flavors MAY be<br>&nbsp;  supported for a SID either individually or in combinations.<br><br>By being "variants", I interpret that the behavior is different than what is specified in §4.1.&nbsp; <br><br><br>(3a) Some of the behaviors, as listed in Table 4, include an indication of the flavors.&nbsp; How are the values interpreted?&nbsp; For example, the Table lists 8 different behaviors related to End:<br><br>| 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0x0001 |&nbsp;  End (no PSP, no USP)&nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0x0002 |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  End with PSP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0x0003 |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  End with USP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0x0004 |&nbsp; &nbsp;  End with PSP&amp;USP&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>...<br>| 28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0x001C |&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  End with USD&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 29&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0x001D |&nbsp; &nbsp;  End with PSP&amp;USD&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0x001E |&nbsp; &nbsp;  End with USP&amp;USD&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>| 31&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0x001F | End with PSP, USP &amp; USD |&nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="http://This.ID">This.ID</a>]&nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br><br>Is value 1 what is specified in §4.1?&nbsp; Or does it include USD, which is not explicitly excluded)?<br><br><br>(3b) If a behavior with more than one flavor is signaled, how should the receiving node determine which one to apply?&nbsp; I guess that the application of behaviors 4 or 29 depends on the number of SLs -- the expected behavior should be clearly specified.<br><br>(3c) Is it assumed that all nodes support all behaviors?&nbsp; Are there mandatory to implement behaviors?&nbsp; Should the behavior be advertised before it is used?<br><br>(3d) §4.16.1.2: <br><br>&nbsp;  When a SID of PSP-flavor is processed at a non-penultimate SR Segment<br>&nbsp;  Endpoint Node, the PSP behavior is not performed as described in the<br>&nbsp;  pseudocode below since Segments Left would not be zero.<br><br>For example, for the End behavior, I'm assuming that behavior 1 is performed instead of 2 (or 4, or 29, or 31) if SL != 0.&nbsp; Should this be done even if the node did not advertise the non-PSP flavor?&nbsp; If the node is not known to support the PSP flavor, should it be an error to receive a packet requesting that behavior?<br><br>If only the PSP flavor is advertised, can the Source assume that the node also supports the non-PSP flavor?<br><br>&nbsp; [BTW, I'm asking about advertisement because §4.16.1.1 makes the statement<br>&nbsp; that the nodes "advertise the SIDs instantiated on them via control plane<br>&nbsp; protocols as described in Section 9".&nbsp; Even though §9 talks about control<br>&nbsp; plane protocols are "not necessary for an SDN control plane" because "one<br>&nbsp; expects the controller to explicitly provision the SIDs".]<br><br><br>(3e) §4.16.2 describes the USP flavor, which is one where the endpoint consumes the packet by processing the next header.&nbsp; I don't understand how the outcome due to the extended process is different from the original one in §4.1.&nbsp; Can you please explain?&nbsp; It seems to me that the externally observable result is the same.<br><br>I have the same question about the USD flavor and the externally observable behavior related to §4.1.<br><br>In general, the observable behavior of §4.1, USP, and USD seem the same to me.&nbsp; The next two points are related.<br><br><br>(3f) §4.16.3 describes the USD flavor, which assumes that the decapsulation results in a packet that can be forwarded.&nbsp; Can the FIB lookup result in a local destination?<br><br><br>(3g) Does the USD flavor mean that, for the End behavior (as described in §4.1), the action of "process the next header in the packet" cannot result in a forwarded packet?&nbsp; Same question for the USP behavior?<br><br><br>(3h) The last paragraph in §4.16.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  An implementation that supports the USD flavor in conjunction with<br>&nbsp;  the USP flavor MAY optimize the packet processing by first looking<br>&nbsp;  whether the conditions for the USD flavor are met, in which case it<br>&nbsp;  can proceed with USD processing else do USP processing.<br><br>What are the "conditions for the USD flavor"?&nbsp; As far as I can tell from the document, the only condition is for the specific behavior to be signaled.&nbsp; What else?<br><br>Going back to the questions above...&nbsp; When is the option to optimize possible?&nbsp; Does a specific behavior have to be used?&nbsp; Behavior 30 (End with USP&amp;USD)?&nbsp; Or can it also optimize if behavior 3 (End with USP) is signaled?<br><br><br><br>(4) §10.2 creates a new registry with an "FCFS" registration procedure.&nbsp; I am assuming that this is the same as the "First Come First Served" (no abbreviation!) policy from <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">rfc8126</a>; please add a reference if that is the case.&nbsp; The description used is not the same as what <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">rfc8126</a> specifies:<br><br>- "Requests for allocation...must include a...preferably also a brief<br>&nbsp; description of how the value will be used."&nbsp;  Using "preferably" indicates<br>&nbsp; that a description is optional.&nbsp; However, it is not optional in <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">rfc8126</a>.<br><br>- "...brief description...may be provided with a reference to an Internet<br>&nbsp; Draft or an RFC or in some other documentation that is permanently and<br>&nbsp; readily available."&nbsp; There is no such requirement in <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">rfc8126</a>.&nbsp; For example,<br>&nbsp; the "Specification Required" policy requires "a permanent and readily<br>&nbsp; available public specification".&nbsp; Is that what you want&nbsp; instead?<br><br><br><br>(5) This point is for the IESG to discuss.<br><br>§4.16.1.2:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The End, End.X and End.T behaviors with PSP do not contravene<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 4 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>] because the destination address of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; incoming packet is the address of the node executing the behavior.<br><br>The spring WG's interpretation of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">rfc8200</a> was a central point in the appeal presented against the WG consensus on this document.&nbsp; The text above, I believe, reflects that consensus.&nbsp; <br><br>However, given that the document relies on the spring WG's interpretation of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">rfc8200</a>, I think it would be better if the text is explicit.&nbsp; <br><br>Suggestion: to add at the end of the paragraph&gt;<br> <br>&nbsp;  This conclusion represents the consensus interpretation of the spring WG.</div></td>

Not surprisingly given the large number of contributors working on this document I only have a few minor comments:<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Terminology<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NH: Next-header field of the IPv6 header [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>].&nbsp; NH=SRH means<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that the next-header of the IPv6 header is Routing Header for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  IPv6(43) with the Type field set to 4.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Suggest expanding "4" to SRH(4)<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 10.1.&nbsp; Ethernet Next Header Type<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document requests IANA to allocate, in the "Protocol Numbers"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  registry (<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-">https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-</a><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  numbers.xhtml), a new value for "Ethernet" with the following<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  definition: The value 143 in the Next Header field of an IPv6 header<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  or any extension header indicates that the payload is an Ethernet<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [IEEE.802.3_2012].<br><br>Should this point to the latest published version of 802.3 (2018), or does it specifically need to reference an older version?<br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1.&nbsp; SID Format<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This document defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  where a locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the SID, followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  arguments (ARG).&nbsp; L, the locator length, is flexible, and an operator<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  is free to use the locator length of their choice.&nbsp; F and A may be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  any value as long as L+F+A &lt;= 128.&nbsp; When L+F+A is less than 128 then<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the remainder of the SID MUST be zero.<br><br>This was reasonably clear to me, but since the rest of the description refers to bits, then I wonder whether the last sentence would be more precise as "the remaining bits of the SID must be set to zero"?<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1.&nbsp; End: Endpoint<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  S09.&nbsp;  If ((Last Entry &gt; max_LE) or (Segments Left &gt; Last Entry+1)) {<br><br>It wasn't entirely apparent to me where 'Last Entry' comes from, although that became more clear when I saw its usage later.&nbsp; Possibly it would be helpful to list "Segments Left" and "Last Entry" in the terminology as taken from <a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC 8754</a>?<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.1.&nbsp; End: Endpoint<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  S12.&nbsp;  Decrement Hop Limit by 1<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Would it be more clear to expand this to say "Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1", since it is referred to as the IPv6 Hop Limit previously.&nbsp; If this is changed, then there are a couple of other places in the document that should be checked as well.<br><br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.2.&nbsp; End.X: Layer-3 Cross-Connect<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Note that if N has an outgoing interface bundle I to a neighbor Q<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  made of 10 member links, N may allocate up to 11 End.X local SIDs:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  one for the bundle(LAG) itself and then up to one for each Layer-2<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  member link.<br><br>This behaviour seems slightly unusual to me.&nbsp; I presume that the intent here is for the SR program to control which member link the traffic travels over rather than the normal behaviour of relying on the Bundle hashing.&nbsp; Possibly adding a bit more text to clarify the expected behaviour might be helpful.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.4.&nbsp; End.DX6: Decapsulation and IPv6 Cross-Connect<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  S05.&nbsp; If the End.DX6 SID is bound to an array of L3 adjacencies, then<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  one entry of the array is selected based on the hash of the packet's<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  header Section 7.<br><br>The end of this sentence doesn't scan for me, probably it should be something end something like: ", see Section 7"<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Counters<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A node supporting this document SHOULD implement a combined traffic<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  counter (packets and bytes) per local SID entry, for traffic that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  matched that SID and was processed correctly.&nbsp; The retrieval of these<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  counters via MIB, NETCONF/YANG or any other means is outside the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  scope of this document.<br>&nbsp;  <br>From my reading, a combined counter implies a single counter that is incremented by both the number of packets processed and number of bytes processed.&nbsp; Normally in the management models you would normally expect this to be modeled as a pair of counters, and I presume that is what is desired here?&nbsp; If so I would suggest clarifying this text to indicate that it is a pair of counters (one for packets, one for bytes) that are required here.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 4, various places.<br><br>At various points the Upper-Layer Header type is compared to a number (e.g. 4, 41, 143).&nbsp; It might be a bit more readable if the associated names were also included in the description.&nbsp; E.g., 4(IPv4), 41(IPv6), etc.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.10.&nbsp; End.DX2V: Decapsulation and VLAN L2 Table Lookup<br><br>Is this lookup just on the outermost VLAN Id, or all VLAN tags in the exposed Ethernet header?&nbsp; Or is this implementation specific?<br><br>Regards,<br>Rob</div></td>

It has been largely reviewed, commented and supported.<br>There is a strong controversy regarding the Penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) flavor which allows an IPv6 source node to instruct the penultimate SRv6 EndPoint (identified, in the IPv6 header, by its IPv6 address) to remove the SRH from the IPv6 packet before the packet reach the final IPv6 destination (the Ultimate SRv6 EndPoint). The consensus to keep that section was particularly rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The specification has multiple implementations, deployments and interop tests.<br>In particular: <br>- There are multiple hardware and software implementations.

For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>On a personnel side, I'm chair and listed as a co-author of the document, among 23 contributors and 6 authors. The reason for taking the shepherd role is that there was no other available co-chair and 29 persons are either contributors or authors which remove a lot of persons. Finally the WGLC was expected to be difficult on the 6MAN side given the SRv6 history and the WGLC on the SRH specification. So there was both a smaller pool of experienced SPRING shepherd and less candidates for the work with a difficult document.<br><br>On a technical side, the section "4.16.1 PSP: Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH" has generated a lot of controversy from some 6MAN participants.<br><br> 6.0 Introduction<br><br>&nbsp; The section 4.16.1 proposes that the Segment Routing Penultimate Endpoint, which receives the IPv6 packet since its IPv6 address is in the IPv6 header destination address, be instructed by the IPv6 source node to remove the SRH (routing header) as/when the SRH is not further useful (Segment Left will be zero when received by the Segment Routing Ultimate Endpoint).<br><br> 6.1 Concern 1 (violation of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The first concern is whether this behavior [1] violates <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> [2].<br><br>&nbsp; More specifically<br>&nbsp;  " S14.4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove the SRH from the IPv6 extension header chain" in [1]<br>&nbsp; Vs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp;  Extension headers (except for the Hop-by-Hop Options header) are not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; path, until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the IPv6 header." in [2]<br><br>&nbsp; On this text, what is been discussed is "the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."<br>&nbsp; More specifically whether "Destination Address field of the IPv6 header" means the "final Destination Address" or the "Destination Address" as seen in the packet that the node received.<br><br>[1] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1</a><br>[2] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4</a><br><br> 6.2 Concern 2 (letter vs spirit of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The second concern is whether the text in the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> really says what was meant.<br>&nbsp; Two erratas have been submitted : <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933</a> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003</a><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; The responsible AD (Suresh) classified the first errata as "Held for Document Update" with the below note: <br>&nbsp;  "Some people might interpret the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> to mean the replacement text provided above in the erratum but others might read the text exactly as written ("until the packet reaches the node identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header”). Given that the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> had consensus and it is impossible to tell after the fact if the proposed replacement text would have achieved consensus, I believe this erratum falls under the above category.<br><br>&nbsp; The change proposed by this erratum has to be evaluated for correctness and consensus if and when there is an update of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>."<br>&nbsp; [3] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/</a><br>&nbsp; [4] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/</a><br>&nbsp; <br> 6.3 Concern 3 (technical issues with SRH removal)<br> <br>&nbsp; Two points have been raised regarding PMTUD and Authentication Header. The first one has been dismissed and the second is already called out of scope of SRH.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; It's also worth noted that with Segment Routing, the removal of the SRH is performed by the SR penultimate EndPoint at the _explicit_ request/instruction of the source node. Hence the final destination node receives the IP packet exactly as meant by the IP source node: there is no surprise/unexpected change from both the IP source and the final IP destination point of view.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br> 6.4 Shepherd opinion<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 1, based on comments received during the last call and my reading of the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> does seem to allow SRH removal by a node receiving an IPv6 packet with an IPv6 destination address identifying itself.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 2, cf Suresh's note [3] [4]. Going beyond is probably up to IESG and/or the 6MAN WG in a longer term.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 3, SRH removal does not create new technical issue.<br><br>&nbsp; In summary, although the controversy was very significant with very strong opinions expressed, up to statements that appeal(s) will be made, from a SPRING WGLC standpoint, I don't believe that there is ground to block the progression of this draft toward the IESG. Quite the contrary, I think that the IESG should make the call by themselves with regards to concern 1 and 2, especially since the IESG had approved the document been debated (<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, in particular section 4.1.16).<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

It has been largely reviewed, commented and supported.<br>There is a strong controversy regarding the Penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) flavor which allows an IPv6 source node to instruct the penultimate SRv6 EndPoint (identified, in the IPv6 header, by its IPv6 address) to remove the SRH from the IPv6 packet before the packet reach the final IPv6 destination (the Ultimate SRv6 EndPoint). The consensus to keep that section was particularly rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The specification has multiple implementations, deployments and interop tests.<br>In particular: <br>- There are multiple hardware and software implementations.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The whole document has been reviewed before and after the WGLC.

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document uses the IPv6 SRH routing header. The Working Group Last Call has been copied to the 6MAN WG and the document has been reviewed and commented by 6MAN participants.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>On a personnel side, I'm chair and listed as a co-author of the document, among 23 contributors and 6 authors. The reason for taking the shepherd role is that there was no other available co-chair and 29 persons are either contributors or authors which remove a lot of persons. Finally the WGLC was expected to be difficult on the 6MAN side given the SRv6 history and the WGLC on the SRH specification. So there was both a smaller pool of experienced SPRING shepherd and less candidates for the work with a difficult document.<br><br>On a technical side, the section "4.16.1 PSP: Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH" has generated a lot of controversy from some 6MAN participants.<br><br> 6.0 Introduction<br><br>&nbsp; The section 4.16.1 proposes that the Segment Routing Penultimate Endpoint, which receives the IPv6 packet since its IPv6 address is in the IPv6 header destination address, be instructed by the IPv6 source node to remove the SRH (routing header) as/when the SRH is not further useful (Segment Left will be zero when received by the Segment Routing Ultimate Endpoint).<br><br> 6.1 Concern 1 (violation of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The first concern is whether this behavior [1] violates <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> [2].<br><br>&nbsp; More specifically<br>&nbsp;  " S14.4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove the SRH from the IPv6 extension header chain" in [1]<br>&nbsp; Vs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp;  Extension headers (except for the Hop-by-Hop Options header) are not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; path, until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the IPv6 header." in [2]<br><br>&nbsp; On this text, what is been discussed is "the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."<br>&nbsp; More specifically whether "Destination Address field of the IPv6 header" means the "final Destination Address" or the "Destination Address" as seen in the packet that the node received.<br><br>[1] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1</a><br>[2] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4</a><br><br> 6.2 Concern 2 (letter vs spirit of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The second concern is whether the text in the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> really says what was meant.<br>&nbsp; Two erratas have been submitted : <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933</a> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003</a><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; The responsible AD (Suresh) classified the first errata as "Held for Document Update" with the below note: <br>&nbsp;  "Some people might interpret the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> to mean the replacement text provided above in the erratum but others might read the text exactly as written ("until the packet reaches the node identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header”). Given that the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> had consensus and it is impossible to tell after the fact if the proposed replacement text would have achieved consensus, I believe this erratum falls under the above category.<br><br>&nbsp; The change proposed by this erratum has to be evaluated for correctness and consensus if and when there is an update of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>."<br>&nbsp; [3] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/</a><br>&nbsp; [4] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/</a><br>&nbsp; <br> 6.3 Concern 3 (technical issues with SRH removal)<br> <br>&nbsp; Two points have been raised regarding PMTUD and Authentication Header. The first one has been dismissed and the second is already called out of scope of SRH.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; It's also worth noted that with Segment Routing, the removal of the SRH is performed by the SR penultimate EndPoint at the _explicit_ request/instruction of the source node. Hence the final destination node receives the IP packet exactly as meant by the IP source node: there is no surprise/unexpected change from both the IP source and the final IP destination point of view.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br> 6.4 Shepherd opinion<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 1, based on comments received during the last call and my reading of the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> does seem to allow SRH removal by a node receiving an IPv6 packet with an IPv6 destination address identifying itself.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 2, cf Suresh's note [3] [4]. Going beyond is probably up to IESG and/or the 6MAN WG in a longer term.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 3, SRH removal does not create new technical issue.<br><br>&nbsp; In summary, although the controversy was very significant with very strong opinions expressed, up to statements that appeal(s) will be made, from a SPRING WGLC standpoint, I don't believe that there is ground to block the progression of this draft toward the IESG. Quite the contrary, I think that the IESG should make the call by themselves with regards to concern 1 and 2, especially since the IESG had approved the document been debated (<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, in particular section 4.1.16).<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

It has been largely reviewed, commented and supported.<br>There is a strong controversy regarding the Penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) flavor which allows an IPv6 source node to instruct the penultimate SRv6 EndPoint (identified, in the IPv6 header, by its IPv6 address) to remove the SRH from the IPv6 packet before the packet reach the final IPv6 destination (the Ultimate SRv6 EndPoint). The consensus to keep that section was particularly rough.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>The specification has multiple implementations, deployments and interop tests.<br>In particular: <br>- There are multiple hardware and software implementations.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The whole document has been reviewed before and after the WGLC.

If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>The document uses the IPv6 SRH routing header. The Working Group Last Call has been copied to the 6MAN WG and the document has been reviewed and commented by 6MAN participants.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>On a personnel side, I'm chair and listed as a co-author of the document, among 23 contributors and 6 authors. The reason for taking the shepherd role is that there was no other available co-chair and 29 persons are either contributors or authors which remove a lot of persons. Finally the WGLC was expected to be difficult on the 6MAN side given the SRv6 history and the WGLC on the SRH specification. So there was both a smaller pool of experienced SPRING shepherd and less candidates for the work with a difficult document.<br><br>On a technical side, the section "4.16.1 PSP: Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH" has generated a lot of controversy from some 6MAN participants.<br><br> 6.0 Introduction<br><br>&nbsp; The section 4.16.1 proposes that the Segment Routing Penultimate Endpoint, which receives the IPv6 packet since its IPv6 address is in the IPv6 header destination address, be instructed by the IPv6 source node to remove the SRH (routing header) as/when the SRH is not further useful (Segment Left will be zero when received by the Segment Routing Ultimate Endpoint).<br><br> 6.1 Concern 1 (violation of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The first concern is whether this behavior [1] violates <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> [2].<br><br>&nbsp; More specifically<br>&nbsp;  " S14.4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove the SRH from the IPv6 extension header chain" in [1]<br>&nbsp; Vs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp;  Extension headers (except for the Hop-by-Hop Options header) are not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; processed, inserted, or deleted by any node along a packet's delivery<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; path, until the packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; of the IPv6 header." in [2]<br><br>&nbsp; On this text, what is been discussed is "the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header."<br>&nbsp; More specifically whether "Destination Address field of the IPv6 header" means the "final Destination Address" or the "Destination Address" as seen in the packet that the node received.<br><br>[1] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming#section-4.16.1</a><br>[2] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8200#section-4</a><br><br> 6.2 Concern 2 (letter vs spirit of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>)<br> <br>&nbsp; The second concern is whether the text in the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> really says what was meant.<br>&nbsp; Two erratas have been submitted : <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5933</a> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003">https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid6003</a><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; The responsible AD (Suresh) classified the first errata as "Held for Document Update" with the below note: <br>&nbsp;  "Some people might interpret the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> to mean the replacement text provided above in the erratum but others might read the text exactly as written ("until the packet reaches the node identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6 header”). Given that the text in <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a> had consensus and it is impossible to tell after the fact if the proposed replacement text would have achieved consensus, I believe this erratum falls under the above category.<br><br>&nbsp; The change proposed by this erratum has to be evaluated for correctness and consensus if and when there is an update of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>."<br>&nbsp; [3] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/tRn94-NlupHLcWdzo7O9BfHpiik/</a><br>&nbsp; [4] <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/yVKxBF3VnJQkIRuM8lgWN4_G3-o/</a><br>&nbsp; <br> 6.3 Concern 3 (technical issues with SRH removal)<br> <br>&nbsp; Two points have been raised regarding PMTUD and Authentication Header. The first one has been dismissed and the second is already called out of scope of SRH.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; It's also worth noted that with Segment Routing, the removal of the SRH is performed by the SR penultimate EndPoint at the _explicit_ request/instruction of the source node. Hence the final destination node receives the IP packet exactly as meant by the IP source node: there is no surprise/unexpected change from both the IP source and the final IP destination point of view.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  <br> 6.4 Shepherd opinion<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 1, based on comments received during the last call and my reading of the section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, section 4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> does seem to allow SRH removal by a node receiving an IPv6 packet with an IPv6 destination address identifying itself.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 2, cf Suresh's note [3] [4]. Going beyond is probably up to IESG and/or the 6MAN WG in a longer term.<br>&nbsp; Regarding concern 3, SRH removal does not create new technical issue.<br><br>&nbsp; In summary, although the controversy was very significant with very strong opinions expressed, up to statements that appeal(s) will be made, from a SPRING WGLC standpoint, I don't believe that there is ground to block the progression of this draft toward the IESG. Quite the contrary, I think that the IESG should make the call by themselves with regards to concern 1 and 2, especially since the IESG had approved the document been debated (<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>, in particular section 4.1.16).<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Each author has replied to the IPR call on the mailing list.<br>Each contributor _except Gaurav Naik and&nbsp; Milad Sharif_ has replied to the IPR call on the mailing list. Those two contributors (out of 23) could not be reached. Note that both had replied (no IPR) during the call for _adoption_.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>One IPR disclosure has been filed.<br>No WG discussion on this IPR.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>This document has been largely reviewed and received a large support, both from vendors and network operators. It has multiple implementations and deployments.<br>This document is a foundation of the SRv6 specification.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>A few persons threatened for an appeal and I believe that such appeal is likely.<br>The strong controversy is related to section 4.16.1.&nbsp; "PSP: Penultimate Segment Pop of the SRH" and whether it violates <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a> (IPv6 specification) section 4.1.16.<br>Cf question "6" for more details.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>The document has 6 authors, beyond the 5 authors limit. An exception is requested given the significant work on this document: significant scope, importance (basis of SRv6), with multiple implementations and deployments.<br><br>Idnits has been run and error corrected.<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist done.<br>Shepherd has reviewed the draft and made comments. Those have been addressed by the editor.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>The document has no MIB, Yang model, media type or URI type.<br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>No.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>I confirm the points.<br>The largest part of the IANA section are the codepoints associated with SR EndPoints behaviors. In the document, the behaviors are referred to by "user friendly" names (e.g., End, End.X). The codepoints themselves are only defined in the IANA section, hence there is no risk of inconsistency between the body of the document and the IANA section. Given the number of codepoints, I think that this is better, especially since the codepoints are not used in this document but will be used by future documents (e.g. control planes extension).<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The document has not sections written in formal language.<br><br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>The document has no YANG module.</div></td>
