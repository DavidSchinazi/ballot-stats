 Each possible proxy offer SHOULD be attempted up to the point where a<br>&nbsp;  voucher is received: while there are many ways in which the attempt<br>&nbsp;  may fail, it does not succeed until the voucher has been validated.<br><br>nit: I suggest "valid voucher is received".<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The pledge requests and validates a voucher using the new REST<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calls described below.<br><br>nit: I think the validation is local and does not use the REST call.<br><br>&nbsp;

(Also, full stop after<br>parenthetical, not before.)<br><br>&nbsp;  proximity-registrar-cert:&nbsp; In a pledge voucher-request this is the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; first certificate in the TLS server 'certificate_list' sequence<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (see [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>]) presented by the registrar to the pledge.&nbsp; That<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is, it is the end-entity certificate.&nbsp; This MUST be populated in a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pledge voucher-request if the "proximity" assertion is populated.<br><br>nit: there is no "proximity" field to be populated; it's the "assertion"<br>field that's populated with the value "proximity".<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  serial-number:&nbsp; The serial number of the pledge the registrar would<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; like a voucher for.&nbsp; The registrar determines this value by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parsing the authenticated pledge IDevID certificate.&nbsp; See<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 2.3.&nbsp; The registrar MUST verify that the serial number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; field it parsed matches the serial number field the pledge<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provided in its voucher-request.&nbsp; This provides a sanity check<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; useful for detecting error conditions and logging.&nbsp; The registrar<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST NOT simply copy the serial number field from a pledge voucher<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request as that field is claimed but not certified.<br><br>(Just to be clear, the serial-number field is optional in the pledge's<br>voucher-request.)<br><br>Section 5.6.2<br><br>&nbsp;  intervals according to the backoff timer described earlier.&nbsp; Attempts<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD be repeated as failure may be the result of a temporary<br>&nbsp;  inconsistently (an inconsistently rolled registrar key, or some other<br>&nbsp;  mis-configuration).&nbsp; The inconsistently could also be the result an<br>&nbsp;  active MITM attack on the EST connection.<br><br>nit: only one of these "inconsistently"s is correct; the others should<br>be "inconsistency".<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  although it results in additional network traffic.&nbsp; The relying MASA<br>&nbsp;  implementation MAY leverage internal state to associate this request<br>&nbsp;  with the original, and by now already validated, voucher-request so<br>&nbsp;  as to avoid an extra crypto validation.<br><br>It seems that doing so would turn the voucher-request into a bearer<br>token for retrieving audit-log information (if the MASA accepts<br>unauthenticated clients).<br><br>Section 5.8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  If the "pinned-domain-cert" certificate includes the<br>&nbsp;  SubjectKeyIdentifier (Section 4.2.1.2 [<a href="/doc/rfc5280/">RFC5280</a>]), then it is to be<br>&nbsp;  used as the domainID.&nbsp; If not, then it is the SPKI Fingerprint as<br>&nbsp;  described in [<a href="/doc/rfc7469/">RFC7469</a>] section 2.4 is to be used.&nbsp; This value needs<br>&nbsp;  to be calculated by both MASA (to populate the audit-log), and by the<br>&nbsp;  Registrar (to recognize itself).<br><br>nit: maybe "to recognize itself in the audit log"?<br><br>Section 5.9<br><br>&nbsp;  The pledge SHOULD follow the BRSKI operations with EST enrollment<br>&nbsp;  operations including "CA Certificates Request", "CSR Attributes" and<br>&nbsp;  "Client Certificate Request" or "Server-Side Key Generation", etc.<br>&nbsp;  This is a relatively seamless integration since BRSKI REST calls<br><br>(I think we decided to not call this REST.)<br><br>Section 7.3<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; A registrar MAY ignore unrecognized nonceless log entries.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  could occur when used equipment is purchased with a valid history<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  being deployed in air gap networks that required permanent<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  vouchers.<br><br>"nonceless" and "permanent" are related but subtly different concepts,<br>given the potential for an expiration date in a nonceless voucher.<br><br>Section 7.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  As a third option, the manufacturer's trust anchors could be entirely<br>&nbsp;  overwitten with local trust anchors.&nbsp; A factory default would never<br>&nbsp;  restore those anchors.&nbsp; This option comes with a lot of power, but<br>&nbsp;  also a lot of responsability: if the new anchors are lost the<br>&nbsp;  manufacturer may be unable to help.<br><br>nit: perhaps we refer to the private key portions of the anchors.<br><br>Section 11<br><br>I am somewhat embarassed that I did not previously note that the<br>mechanism used to generate the domainID needs to be<br>second-preimage-resistant or an attacker can claim to be a registrar for<br>a domain that already exists.<br><br>Section 11.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Although the nonce used by the Pledge in the voucher-request does not<br>&nbsp;  require a strong cryptographic randomness, the use of TLS in all of<br>&nbsp;  the protocols in this document does.<br><br>We discuss the need for strong randomness in the nonce in Section 11.3,<br>so it's not clear this is actually true.</div></td>

provided in its voucher-request.&nbsp; This provides a sanity check<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; useful for detecting error conditions and logging.&nbsp; The registrar<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST NOT simply copy the serial number field from a pledge voucher<br>&nbsp;

 The pledge SHOULD follow the BRSKI operations with EST enrollment<br>&nbsp;  operations including "CA Certificates Request", "CSR Attributes" and<br>&nbsp;  "Client Certificate Request" or "Server-Side Key Generation", etc.<br>&nbsp;

If<br>&nbsp;  present, the nonce in the voucher must match the nonce the pledge<br>&nbsp;  submitted to the registrar; vouchers with no nonce can also be<br>&nbsp;  accepted (according to local policy).<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  The Status field indicates if the voucher was acceptable.&nbsp; Boolean<br>&nbsp;  values are acceptable.<br><br>nit: I suggest """acceptable, as a boolean, where "true" indicates the<br>voucher was acceptable""".<br><br>&nbsp;

This is really a discuss discuss. With to little time to dig into the details it appears that this protocol is making i hack of its interface towards the its transport. It appears to attempt to use an HTTP rest interface, but then it is also have a lot of talking about requirement for the TLS connection underlying the HTTP. So to illustrate the issue I see here is what happens if one like to use QUIC as the underlying transport for the rest interface rather than TCP/TLS? So can this document achieve a clearer interface to the lower layers so that it will be simpler to move the protocol to another underlying version of the HTTP "transport"? <br><br>B.

it refers<br>to the Internet PKI, and so things like a private PKI internal to a<br>manufacturer would probably not be best described as such.&nbsp; Such private<br>PKIs can of course still reuse the protocols and mechanisms developed<br>for PKIX, and it's accurate to describe them as such.<br><br>(11) In a few places we describe the voucher-request in terms of its<br>YANG structure but do not say that it has to be wrapped in a signed CMS<br>object as is done for the <a href="/doc/rfc8366/">RFC 8366</a> voucher.<br><br>(12) Maybe this is a "discuss discuss", but why do we need SHA-1 in the<br>domainID calculation?<br><br>(13) In Section 5.5.1:<br><br>&nbsp;

Or does this extend to longer timescales, like a<br>device that gets deployed for a couple years and is&nbsp; then reset to<br>factory settings and has to rebootstrap but is still by the same<br>registrar?<br><br><br>(14) In Section 5.6:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The server MUST answer with a suitable 4xx<br>&nbsp;  or 5xx HTTP [<a href="/doc/rfc2616/">RFC2616</a>] error code when a problem occurs.&nbsp; In this<br>&nbsp;  case, the response data from the MASA MUST be a plaintext human-<br>&nbsp;  readable (ASCII, English) error message containing explanatory<br>&nbsp;  information describing why the request was rejected.<br><br>It seems hard to support this stance on internationalization in 2019.<br><br><br>(15) In Section 5.9.4:<br><br>&nbsp;  To indicate successful enrollment the client SHOULD re-negotiate the<br>&nbsp;  EST TLS session using the newly obtained credentials.&nbsp; This occurs by<br>&nbsp;  the client initiating a new TLS ClientHello message on the existing<br>&nbsp;  TLS connection.&nbsp; The client MAY simply close the old TLS session and<br>&nbsp;  start a new one.&nbsp; The server MUST support either model.<br><br>Is this supposed to be sending a new TLS ClientHello in the application<br>data channel or as a new handshake message (aka "renegotiation")?&nbsp; The<br>latter is not possible in TLS 1.3 and is generally disrecommended<br>anyways even in TLS 1.2.&nbsp; I would strongly suggest to remove the<br>"renegotiation" option and just leave "close the connection and start a<br>new connection/handshake".</div></td>

 The MASA MUST verify that the registrar voucher-request is signed by<br>&nbsp;  a registrar.&nbsp; This is confirmed by verifying that the id-kp-cmcRA<br>&nbsp;  extended key usage extension field (as detailed in EST <a href="/doc/rfc7030/">RFC7030</a><br>&nbsp;  section 3.6.1) exists in the certificate of the entity that signed<br>&nbsp;  the registrar voucher-request.&nbsp; This verification is only a<br>&nbsp;  consistency check that the unauthenticated domain CA intended the<br>&nbsp;  voucher-request signer to be a registrar.&nbsp; Performing this check<br>&nbsp;  provides value to the domain PKI by assuring the domain administrator<br>&nbsp;  that the MASA service will only respect claims from authorized<br>&nbsp;  Registration Authorities of the domain.<br><br>If the MASA has no prior knowledge of the domain (certificate), this is<br>susceptible to anyone spinning up something that claims to be a domain<br>CA and issuing registrar certs with that extension.&nbsp; We need to document<br>somewhere what other part of the system prevents that from causing an<br>unauthorized voucher to be used.&nbsp; (Perhaps preventing one from being<br>issued is not feasible, but acceptable if the pledge will not accept<br>it, though there remains risk of DoS on the MASA.)<br><br>Section 5.5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  If a nonceless voucher-request is submitted the MASA MUST<br>&nbsp;  authenticate the registrar as described in either EST [<a href="/doc/rfc7030/">RFC7030</a>]<br>&nbsp;  section 3.2, section 3.3, or by validating the registrar's<br><br>Subsubsection references might be more helpful.<br><br>&nbsp;

Even the previous section does<br>not really say much to indicate there is value in authenticating the<br>signature on the voucher request.<br><br>Section 5.5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  authentication or voucher-request signature validation.&nbsp; Similarly,<br>&nbsp;  as noted in Section 5.5.2, the MASA performs normal PKIX revocation<br>&nbsp;  checking during signature consistency checks (a signature by a<br>&nbsp;  registrar certificate that has been revoked is an inconsistency).<br><br>I think this needs to be noted more clearly in Section 5.5.2.<br><br>Section 5.5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  The MASA MAY verify that the registrar voucher-request includes the<br>&nbsp;  'prior-signed-voucher-request' field.&nbsp; If so the prior-signed-<br>&nbsp;  voucher-request MUST include a 'proximity-registrar-cert' that is<br>&nbsp;  consistent with the certificate used to sign the registrar voucher-<br>&nbsp;  request.&nbsp; Additionally the voucher-request serial-number leaf MUST<br><br>This seems kind of tautological ("if the MASA is checking X, X MUST have<br>happened").&nbsp; Also, what does "consistent with"&nbsp; mean?<br><br>&nbsp;  match the pledge serial-number that the MASA extracts from the<br>&nbsp;  signing certificate of the prior-signed-voucher-request.&nbsp; The MASA is<br>&nbsp;  aware of which pledges support signing of their voucher requests and<br>&nbsp;  can use this information to confirm proximity of the pledge with the<br>&nbsp;  registrar, thus ensuring that the BRSKI-EST TLS connection has no<br>&nbsp;  man-in-the-middle.<br><br>To be clear, this MITM detection is only for the case of pledges that<br>sign their voucher requests, right?&nbsp; And it seems to only hold if<br>pledges that support signing actually do sign, every time.<br><br>Section 5.5.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The registrar's certificate chain is extracted from the signature<br>&nbsp;  method.&nbsp; The chain includes the domain CA certificate as specified in<br>&nbsp;  Section 5.5.&nbsp; This certificate is used to populate the "pinned-<br><br>I don't think Section 5.5 is the right reference for "includes the<br>domain CA certificate" (both here and in 5.5.2).<br><br>&nbsp;

Just the audit log?&nbsp; Surely in that case SHA-1 is<br>not a hard requirement...<br><br>Section 5.5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  The MASA MUST use the nonce from the registrar voucher-request for<br>&nbsp;  the resulting voucher and audit log.&nbsp;

 The MASA voucher response to the registrar is forwarded without<br>&nbsp;  changes to the pledge; therefore this section applies to both the<br>&nbsp;  MASA and the registrar.&nbsp; The HTTP signaling described applies to both<br>&nbsp;  the MASA and registrar responses.&nbsp; A registrar either caches prior<br>&nbsp;  MASA responses or dynamically requests a new voucher based on local<br>&nbsp;  policy (it does not generate or sign a voucher).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Do we need to say how this local caching policy interacts with HTTP<br>cache control headers?<br>I got confused by "or dynamically requests a new voucher" the first<br>couple times I read it;

 Additionally the domainID captures only the unauthenticated subject<br>&nbsp;  key identifier of the domain.&nbsp; A privacy sensitive domain could<br><br>It's interesting to see "unauthenticated" used here, since the domainID<br>is deterministically generated from the pinned-domain-cert that is<br>included in the voucher and inserted into the pledge's trust store.&nbsp; So<br>in a sense it is a committal by "the domain" to tie that domain cert to<br>that device or have the device otherwise be unusable.&nbsp; The subsequent<br>text here seems to be suggesting that instead of having a single root CA<br>cert used by all devices in the domain, distinct certs would be used for<br>each device, thus attempting to remove an ability to associate devices<br>with each other via joint domain membership.&nbsp; One might imagine doing<br>this by entering intermediate CAs (or even leafs?) into the<br>pinned-domain-cert field, but if those certs ever become visible (e.g.,<br>via certificate transparency), then the domainIDs can be independently<br>computed and associated to the MASA audit log, and the issuer chain used<br>to recorrelate the devices by domainID.&nbsp; So to fully protect privacy,<br>the per-device pinned-domain-certs would need to be "root"s (i.e.,<br>self-issued), which greatly increases the manageability complexity and<br>is in effect counter to the goals of ANIMA and BRSKI.<br><br>Section 10.2<br><br>&nbsp;

 This pledge voucher-request would be 'stale' in that it has a nonce<br>&nbsp;  that no longer matches the internal state of the pledge.&nbsp; In order to<br>&nbsp;  successfully use any resulting voucher the Rm would need to remove<br>&nbsp;  the stale nonce or anticipate the pledge's future nonce state.<br>&nbsp;  Reducing the possibility of this is why the pledge is mandated to<br>&nbsp;  generate a strong random or pseudo-random number nonce.<br><br>This gets a bit more complicated to reason about when we assume that a<br>pledge will have multiple voucher requests out in parallel, instead of<br>doing them in sequence and timing out (so that there is literally only<br>one valid nonce at a given time)...<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, in order to successfully use the resulting voucher the<br>&nbsp;  Rm would have to attack the pledge and return it to a bootstrapping<br>&nbsp;  enabled state.&nbsp; This would require wiping the pledge of current<br><br>... and I think there is a different attack if the Rm is in a position<br>to delay or drop network traffic between the&nbsp;

It seems like this document needs to make clear to manufacturers that a fallback manual enrollment mechanism of some sort needs to be implemented along with BRSKI in order to avoid this situation.<br><br>= Section 1.3.1 =<br><br>"But this solution is not exclusive to large equipment: it is intended<br>&nbsp;  to scale to thousands of devices located in hostile environments,<br>&nbsp;  such as ISP provided CPE devices which are drop-shipped to the end<br>&nbsp;  user."<br><br>I don't quite understand how this squares with the scope limitation described in Section 1 and Section 9.

The secondary market for network gear is vibrant (e.g I purchased a Brocade 48 port 10GE switch for performance testing on the secondary market for &lt;$300) - this was after Brocade had been acquired, and Broadcom has no incentive to transfer it to me - they'd (understandably!) much rather I purchase a shiny new switch. A search on eBay for "Cisco switch" generates ~23,000 hits- while some may be for compatibles / modules, it does still demonstrate that this is a common thing -- this is especially important in developing countries, where many networks made extensive use of used / pre-loved gear.<br><br>I see very little incentive for vendors to facilitate transfers, and don't really see enough text about allowing operators to override / bypass this to make me comfortable.<br>I was going to Abstain, but I'm an author on a document which also allows secure device install, and so feel it is more appropriate to Recuse</div></td>

The authors also include experts<br>&nbsp; of prior security protocol standards (e.g.: <a href="/doc/rfc7030/">RFC7030</a>).<br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No concerns by the document shepherd or the WG (in the memory of the shepherd).<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>The Cisco and Silver Sprint disclosures where brought up by the WG when they<br>where filed (2014/2016) with no concerns raised. All three IPR where brought<br>up during Shepherd Writeup when it was it was discovered that the Juniper<br>IPR had only been disclosed against draft-netconf-zerotouch (which shares the<br>voucher with BRSKI). Juniper immediately also filed the disclosure against BRSKI<br>because it might be applicable to BRSKI to. No concerns against the document<br>processing where raised because of any of the disclosures.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There is broad support for this document.

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; This document is now free of officially tracked nits.<br>&nbsp; There is a small number of other nits discoverded through this shepherd writeup,<br>&nbsp; the authors have been asked to fix them in the next rev, and this email<br>&nbsp; is appended at the end of this writeup.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; The document requires IANA review and YANG doctor review.<br>&nbsp; Datatracker already shows the included YANG definitions to pass YANG validation.<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7228/">rfc7228</a> defined terminology is used in this document and therefore that<br>&nbsp; document is listed as a normative reference even though it is an informational<br>&nbsp; document. Shepherd thinks this is appropriate because this documents terminology is now widely<br>&nbsp; accepted and there is no standard document alternative for this terminology.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No change to existing RFCs suggested.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; The All requests in IANA section are correct&nbsp; correct except for the request details for the voucherstatustelemetry. See NITs below.<br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The new registry requested is "BRSKI parameters". Shepherd suggests to list two volunteering authors as experts: Max Pritkin and Michael Richardson.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>YANG definitions in the document where generated by YANG toolchain and<br>are passing datatracker syntax check. For source of toolchain see:<br><br><a href="https://github.com/anima-wg/anima-bootstrap/blob/master/Makefile">https://github.com/anima-wg/anima-bootstrap/blob/master/Makefile</a><br><br>NITS:<br>A) - D) resolved<br><br>E) IANA<br><br>&nbsp;  E.1) The text for for requesting pledgestatustelemtry is ok (reigstry+table), but<br>&nbsp;  i think the text for decribing how the table should look like is<br>&nbsp;  incomplete:<br><br>&nbsp;  The text is just requesting some initial values(version,...), but no<br>&nbsp;  context associated with it.<br><br>&nbsp;  A comparable JSON table is requested in <a href="/doc/rfc7519/">rfc7519</a> section 10.1. In<br>&nbsp;  subsection 10.1.1 is defines the requested registration template,<br>&nbsp;  which include (using current BRSKI terminology): "item", "item description",<br>&nbsp;  "change controller", "specification document(s)".<br><br>&nbsp;  Resulting registry is in <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml</a> <br><br>&nbsp;  I would suggest to amend the IANA section text to match such an example<br>&nbsp;  in spirit. The four columns in <a href="/doc/rfc7519/">rfc7519</a> look reasonable. IMHO the "item"<br>&nbsp;  and "specification document" are mandatory, "change controller" is<br>&nbsp;  very useful, "description" is nice to have.<br><br>&nbsp; E.2) There are two unclear text tags in the PKIX registry text:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EDNOTE (if this is meant to be an AUTH48 or RFC-editor action, please change tag accordingly).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  XXX - </div></td>

All three IPR where brought<br>up during Shepherd Writeup when it was it was discovered that the Juniper<br>IPR had only been disclosed against draft-netconf-zerotouch (which shares the<br>voucher with BRSKI). Juniper immediately also filed the disclosure against BRSKI<br>because it might be applicable to BRSKI to. No concerns against the document<br>processing where raised because of any of the disclosures.<br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>&nbsp; There is broad support for this document. It was reviewed by active WG <br>&nbsp; participants. <br><br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>&nbsp; No. There was unanimous support for this work and nobody raised any objections.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; This document is now free of officially tracked nits.<br>&nbsp; There is a small number of other nits discoverded through this shepherd writeup,<br>&nbsp; the authors have been asked to fix them in the next rev, and this email<br>&nbsp; is appended at the end of this writeup.<br><br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp; The document requires IANA review and YANG doctor review.<br>&nbsp; Datatracker already shows the included YANG definitions to pass YANG validation.<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; See also a nit at the end of this review.<br><br>&nbsp; <a href="/doc/rfc7228/">rfc7228</a> defined terminology is used in this document and therefore that<br>&nbsp; document is listed as a normative reference even though it is an informational<br>&nbsp; document. Shepherd thinks this is appropriate because this terminology is now widely<br>&nbsp; accepted and there is no standard document alternative for this terminology.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; No change to existing RFCs suggested.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp; All requests in IANA section look correct except for one NIT:<br><br>&nbsp; -16 requests one registry for "Voucher status telemetry attributes". I am not<br>&nbsp; even clear if IANA allows single-table registries, but given how there might be&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; future voucher parameters too, i told the authors i would prefer for the request<br>&nbsp; to be changed to "Voucher parameters" registry with one table "Voucher status telemetry<br>&nbsp; attributes". <br><br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp; Spheherd does not have good insight into experts in this space, but suggest<br>&nbsp; to ask ART ADs and consider authors of <a href="/doc/rfc8366/">RFC8366</a> (voucher) as candidates.<br><br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>YANG definitions in the document where generated by YANG toolchain and<br>are passing datatracker syntax check.
