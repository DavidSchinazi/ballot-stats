Introduction<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Quadrant "Administratively Assigned Identifier" (AAI) MAC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addresses are assigned locally by an administrator.&nbsp; Multicast<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv6 packets use a destination address starting in 33-33 and this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; falls within this space and therefore should not be used to avoid<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conflict with the MAC addresses used for use with IPv6 multicast<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addresses.&nbsp; For 48-bit MAC addresses, 44 bits are available.<br><br>Multicast IPv6 packets shouldn't be a problem for the AAI range, on the assumption that only unicast MAC addresses get assigned.&nbsp; Hence, probably the text related to Multicast IPv6 addresses can be deleted.<br><br>3.&nbsp; Quadrant Selection Mechanisms examples<br><br>I see that this text as not being normative, and is potentially somewhat repeating what has been stated in the introduction.&nbsp; I think that this text might be better moved to an appendix.<br><br>4.&nbsp; DHCPv6 Extensions<br><br>The algorithmic description in this document seems to heavily overlap with the algorithm described in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign/">draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign</a>, with a fair amount of repetitive descriptive text of the algorithm.&nbsp; I believe that it would be better if this option was written as a modification of the procedure defined in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign/">draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign</a> (particularly, if the algorithm is simplified as a I propose in my discuss).</div></td>

 o&nbsp; IoT (Internet of Things): where there are a lot of cheap,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sometimes short lived and disposable devices.&nbsp; Examples of this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; include: sensors and actuators for health or home automation<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applications.&nbsp; In this scenario, it is common that upon a first<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boot, the device uses a temporary MAC address, to send initial<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DHCP packets to available DHCP servers.&nbsp; IoT devices typically<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; request a single MAC address for each available network interface.<br><br>I'm a bit confused by the use of present tense here ("it is common"),<br>given that AFAIK the companion document <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign/">draft-ietf-dhc-mac-assign</a> is the<br>first mechanism for DHCP-based MAC address assignment.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; temporary MAC address.&nbsp; This type of device is typically not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moving.&nbsp; In general, any type of SLAP quadrant would be good for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assigning addresses from, but ELI/SAI quadrants might be more<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suitable in some scenarios, such as if the addresses need to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; belong to the CID assigned to the IoT communication device vendor.<br><br>side note: I'm curious what kind of case would require that the address<br>belong to the CID of the device's vendor.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>Interesting that we say that client+server support IA_LL and LLADDR but<br>nothing about QUAD :)<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;

 Last, if we consider the data center scenario, a hypervisor might<br>&nbsp;  request local MAC addresses to be assigned to virtual machines.&nbsp; As<br>&nbsp;  in the previous scenarios, the hypervisor might select the preferred<br>&nbsp;  SLAP quadrant using information provided by the cloud management<br>&nbsp;  system (CMS) or virtualization infrastructure manager (VIM) running<br>&nbsp;  on top of the hypervisor.&nbsp; This information might include, but is not<br>&nbsp;  limited to:<br><br>As was (IIRC) noted by a directorate reviewer, we don't use "CMS" or<br>"VIM" again, and since at least "CMS" collides with another well-known<br>IETF acronym, there seems to be little or negative value in including<br>the acronyms here.<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>I suggest using "IA_LL(LLADDR,QUAD)" in step 1 of Figure 3, as is done<br>for the other lines, to match the prose text's MUST-level requirement to<br>include LLADDR.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  option.&nbsp; In order to indicate the preferred SLAP quadrant(s), the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  IA_LL option includes the new OPTION_SLAP_QUAD option in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  IA_LL-option field (with the LLAADR option).<br><br>Even though QUAD does not give provision for nested options, it would<br>perhaps be better to use "alongside" or "as a sibling of" or similar,<br>rather than "with", to describe the relationship between QUAD and<br>LLADDR.<br>Also, nit: s/LLAADR/LLADDR/.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  an LLADDR option that specifies the addresses being offered.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the server supports the new QUAD IA_LL-option, and manages a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  block of addresses belonging to the requested quadrant(s), the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  addresses being offered MUST belong to the requested quadrant(s).<br><br>nit: I don't expect a single block of addresses to span quadrant<br>boundaries, so perhaps "belonging to a requested quadrant" and "MUST<br>belong to a requested quadrant" would be more appropriate.<br><br>&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; The client waits for available servers to send Advertise<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  responses and picks one server as defined in Section 18.2.9 of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC8415</a>].&nbsp; The client SHOULD NOT pick a server that does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  advertise an address in the requested quadrant.&nbsp; The client then<br><br>Perhaps "quadrant(s)" or "a requested quadrant", to match the previous<br>discussion?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  sends a Request message that includes the IA_LL container option<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  with the LLADDR option copied from the Advertise message sent by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the chosen server.&nbsp; It includes the preferred SLAP quadrant(s) in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  the new QUAD IA_LL-option.<br><br>nit: I think s/the new/a new/ is better, since we have not discussed a<br>new QUAD option in the Request yet.<br><br>&nbsp;  The client SHOULD check if the received MAC address comes from one of<br>&nbsp;  the requested quadrants.&nbsp; Otherwise, the client SHOULD NOT configure<br>&nbsp;  the obtained address.&nbsp; It MAY repeat the process selecting a<br>&nbsp;  different DHCP server.<br><br>"repeat the process" sounds like sending the same Renew to a different<br>server, that is, different from the server that assigned the address<br>whose renewal is being requested.&nbsp; Is that expected to be effective<br>(either in renewing the current assignment or in getting a new<br>allocation in a Reply, as opposed to an "I don't know about that" error<br>response)?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>side note: It's interesting to me that QUAD is not included in a<br>Relay-reply(Advertise()) but is included in a regular Advertise() when<br>no proxy is involved.&nbsp; (Likewise for wrapped Reply().)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; payload.&nbsp; Depending on the server's policy, the instance(s) of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the option to process is selected.&nbsp; For each of the entries in<br><br>Just to check: this is intended to allow both "use only one, and if both<br>are present which to use is up to local policy" and "apply the<br>intersection of both requests [with some local policy for which priority<br>to respect]"?&nbsp; I note that later on we have some text that makes it<br>RECOMMENDED to prefer the client's, in a discussion that does not cover<br>the "intersection" option at all.&nbsp; So perhaps the "intersection" option<br>is not intended to be available?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a Relay-reply message.&nbsp; If the server supports the semantics<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the preferred quadrant included in the QUAD option, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; manages a block of addresses belonging to the requested<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quadrant(s), then the addresses being offered MUST belong to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; requested quadrant(s).&nbsp; The server SHOULD apply the contents of<br><br>[same nit as for §4.1]<br><br>&nbsp;  10.&nbsp; This message is forwarded by the Relay in a Relay-forward<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message, including a QUAD IA_LL-option with the preferred<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quadrant.<br><br>I would consider repeating the mention from above about how the QUAD is<br>included here in case the server has to make a new assignment, to make<br>sure that the client (well, proxy's) preference is available in such<br>cases.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp;

We should probably say something<br>about how the proxy has to be trusted to do the right thing and a<br>malicious proxy could change/override the client's preference.<br><br>I'm surprised that <a href="/doc/rfc7227/">RFC 7227</a> is not referenced here.<br><br>Though it is not referenced (yet?), <a href="/doc/rfc7227/">RFC 7227</a> says that authors of<br>documents defining new DHCP options are "strongly advised to explicitly<br>define validation measures" for recipients of such options.&nbsp;
