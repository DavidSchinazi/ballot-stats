" - is this that the 5/6 tuples cannot be used for flow aggregates? I went to try and find more info on flow aggregates, and looked in ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework (which, like many of the referenced draft-detnet- documents should be Normative references), but it didn't seem to have much detail (other than that "There are many techniques to achieve aggregation" -- where is how flow aggregation actually works documented? This document (S4.4) says that: flow aggregation "is an important technique for improving<br>&nbsp;  scaling by reducing the state per hop", but without understanding how flows are aggregated, and the state needed per flow, this is hard to evaluate. In addition "In either case, the management or control function that provisions the aggregate flows must ensure that adequate resources are allocated and configured to provide combined service requirements of the individual flows." -- if this "of the individual flows", or "of the aggregate flows"? Presumably there will be a difference.<br><br>I found Section "5.3.&nbsp; DetNet IP Traffic Treatment Procedures" to be very terse -- I was expecting to read this and understand what *exactly* the IP Traffic Treatment Procedures are - instead it seemed to feel more like "Implementations must make sure that they provide the service that has been configured". The section says: " Typical mechanisms used to provide different treatment to different flows includes the allocation of system resources (such as queues and buffers) and provisioning or related parameters (such as shaping, and policing). " -- but this all feels fairly circular - where is the treatment of traffic "when operating in an IP packet switched network." actually defined? <br>If I'm building a router/switch/similar, and what to provide support for DetNet over IP, what *exactly* do I do with traffic once it has been identified? How do I queue it differently? What happens if I cannot meet the requirement? Where is this documented? <br><br>Apologies for not being able to review this in the depth it deserves,<br>W</div></td>

 described in [<a href="/doc/rfc8655/">RFC8655</a>].&nbsp; This section considers exclusively security<br><br>side note: the wording of these first two sentences feels a little<br>strange, as if the two documents should be somehow the same but are not.<br>Perhaps:<br><br>% Detailed security considerations for DetNet are catalogued in<br>% [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-security/">I-D.ietf-detnet-security</a>], and a more general (abbreviated) treatment<br>% is provided in [<a href="/doc/rfc8655/">RFC8655</a>].<br><br>Also, it looks like the comments I made on 2020-04-23 regarding<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-security/">draft-ietf-detnet-security</a> (as a side note in my ballot position on<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework/04/">draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework-04</a>) remain applicable:<br><br>% The referenced document (now at -09) seems significantly improved from<br>% when I previously made an in-passing review of the -03<br>% (<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/jZLodXBmQa7ZFDbBIvDO_xCDD0E/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/jZLodXBmQa7ZFDbBIvDO_xCDD0E/</a>),<br>% however, some of the issues I mentioned there remain, at least in part<br>% (e.g., mentioning the use of HMAC without a colocated discussion of<br>% the need for key distribution and having a taxonomy of threats titled<br>% "threat model").<br><br>&nbsp;  Security aspects which are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to<br>&nbsp;  provide the specific quality of service aspects of DetNet, which are<br>&nbsp;  primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet loss rates<br>&nbsp;  and bounded end-to-end delivery latency.<br><br>I recognize that this is essentially verbatim from <a href="/doc/rfc8655/">RFC 8655</a>, but it<br>still reads somewhat strangely to me: specifically, it seems to say that<br>there are "security aspects [...] whose aim is to provide [QoS, low<br>packet loss, and bounded latency]", and I don't think it's the security<br>aspects specifically that aim to provide those.&nbsp; Rather, I think it's<br>the overall goal of DetNet to provide those attributes, and there are<br>some security aspepcts specific to attempting to provide those<br>attributes.<br><br>&nbsp;  The primary considerations for the data plane is to maintain<br>&nbsp;  integrity of data and delivery of the associated DetNet service<br>&nbsp;  traversing the DetNet network.&nbsp; Application flows can be protected<br>&nbsp;  through whatever means is provided by the underlying technology.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  example, encryption may be used, such as that provided by IPSec<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc4301/">RFC4301</a>] for IP flows and/or by an underlying sub-net using MACSec<br>&nbsp;  [IEEE802.1AE-2018] for IP over Ethernet (Layer-2) flows.<br><br>It's good that you call this out, so thank you for that.<br>I'd suggest a slight addition, prefacing the sentence that currently<br>starts with "Application flows" with a lead-in that "Since no<br>DetNet-specific fields are available for DetNet IP, data integrity must<br>be provided by a lower (or, potentially, higher) layer; application<br>flows can [...]".&nbsp; I'd also consider noting that providing guaranteed<br>delivery is impossible in the face of a sufficiently powerful attacker<br>(that can drop all traffic, cut fiber, etc.), so the attacker in the<br>DetNet threat model is necessarily slightly weaker than a typical <a href="/doc/bcp72/">BCP 72</a><br>threat model.<br><br>Section 11.1<br><br>The way in which <a href="/doc/rfc3473/">RFC 3473</a> is used does not seem to require a normative<br>reference, to me.<br><br>(<a href="/doc/rfc4301/">RFC 4301</a> is perhaps in a similar situation, though given that we need<br>normative references to 4302 and 4303, it doesn't stick out as much.)<br><br>Section 11.2<br><br>Was it considered to make <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework/">draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework</a> a<br>normative reference?&nbsp; The reference in Section 3 that says "common data<br>plane procedures and control information for all DetNet data planes" can<br>be found in it makes me wonder whether it contains information that I<br>need to know in order to use detnet-ip properly.</div></td>

 As a general rule, DetNet IP domains need to be able to forward any<br>&nbsp;  DetNet flow identified by the IP 6-tuple.&nbsp; Doing otherwise would<br>&nbsp;  limit the number of 6-tuple flow ID combinations that could be used<br>&nbsp;  by the end systems.&nbsp; From a practical standpoint this means that all<br>&nbsp;  nodes along the end-to-end path of DetNet flows need to agree on what<br>&nbsp;  fields are used for flow identification.<br><br>There is text in §5.1 requiring the ability to forward based on the 6-tuple...but there is nothing related to the "need to agree on what fields are used for flow identification" -- it seems to me that this agreement should also be required.&nbsp;

 each flow's service requirements.&nbsp; This applies for aggregated and<br>&nbsp;  individual flows.<br><br>I guess that "to properly provision" can be a standin for the "need to agree on what fields are used".&nbsp;

IOW, this sounds more like a provisioning requirement (even probably related to the text from §6 I quoted above).<br><br><br><br>(3) §5.1 (DetNet IP Flow Identification Procedures): s/The configuration and control information used to identify an individual DetNet flow MUST be ordered by an implementation./An implementation MUST support ordering of the configuration and control information used to identify an individual DetNet flow.<br><br>The current wording seems to imply that the implementation may order the information any way it wants...but proper identification through the domain depends on consistent ordering.<br><br><br><br>(4) §5.1.1.3 (IPv4 Protocol and IPv6 Next Header Fields): <br><br>&nbsp;

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; (1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard,<br>&gt; Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)?<br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>&gt; Why is this the proper type of RFC?<br><br>This document normatively specifies the use of IP to provide DetNet data plane service.&nbsp; <br><br>&gt; Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>Yes<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>&gt; Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>&gt; examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>&gt; documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Technical Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&gt;&nbsp;  an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  or introduction.<br>This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated data.&nbsp; No DetNet-specific encapsulation is defined to support IP flows; instead, the existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to support flow identification and DetNet service delivery.&nbsp; Procedures and control information that is common to all DetNet data planes can be found in ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework.<br>&gt; Working Group Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&gt;&nbsp;  example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&gt;&nbsp;  were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&gt;&nbsp;  rough?<br>There were many technical debates in the process of creating this draft, but all were resolved with a clear consensus. It took awhile to get there but there is nothing worth noting.<br>&gt; Document Quality<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>The IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are used without modification. At this time there are no shipping implementations of DetNet per se. <br><br>&gt; Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&gt;&nbsp;  implement the specification? <br><br>Several major vendors have been core to the development of DetNet, including Cisco, Huawei, and Ericsson so it is assumed that they plan to implement it. <br><br>&gt; Are there any reviewers that <br>&gt;&nbsp;  merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&gt;&nbsp;  conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&gt;&nbsp;  there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&gt;&nbsp;  review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>The DetNet WG (including David Black, DetNet Technical Advisor) have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. <br>A dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress the set of data plane drafts. <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>&gt; Personnel<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>&gt; Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&gt; the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>&gt; for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>&gt; the IESG.<br>&gt; <br><br>I have reread this document as it progressed as well as in its final form, and have personally contributed a number of suggestions, mostly grammatical details.&nbsp; All significant comments have been addressed. The document is ready for publication. <br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&gt; breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&gt; broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>&gt; DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>&gt; took place.<br>The draft was reviewed in detail by David Black with respect to backwards compatibility with Diffserv. All issues were resolved. <br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>&gt; has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>&gt; IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>&gt; with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>&gt; is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>&gt; has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>&gt; concerns here.<br><br>No concerns. The progress of this draft has been quite linear, and it is ready to be published.<br><br>Regarding the number of authors of this draft, this draft is one of a group that represents a substantial part of the output of the WG for a number of years. We realize that the author count is intended to be 5 or less however we have carefully reviewed the author counts of these drafts at the time of WG LC to validate the contributions, and we sincerely believe that it would not be fair to remove any of the listed authors. <br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&gt; disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>&gt; and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes, authors/contributors know of none, see<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg</a><br><br>&gt; (8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>&gt; If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>&gt; disclosures.<br>&gt;<br><br>There were no IPR concerns raised during WG acceptance of the document, nor during the period of its development.<br>This is a link to the IPR call results: <br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg</a><br><br>&gt; (9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>&gt; represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>&gt; being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Very solid.&nbsp; The document (in the context of the full set of DetNet Data Plane drafts) is mature and has been discussed sufficiently among the broad DetNet WG audience.<br> <br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>&gt; discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate<br>&gt; email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>&gt; separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>&gt; <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&gt; document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>&gt; Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>&gt; thorough.<br><br>IDNits passes without errors. <br>There are idnits warnings regarding "outdated references" but this is because this is one of a set of drafts that refer to each other and will all be published together, so the RFC editor can fix this once all edits are final.&nbsp; <br>There is also a warning "Missing Reference: 'Network' is mentioned on line 174, but not defined" - however, what Idnits is finding is the text&nbsp; “[Network]” in the figure text (which is part of a diagram) and looking for a corresponding reference, which makes no sense, i.e. this is due to a shortcoming of idnits, not the draft. <br> <br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>&gt; criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>&gt;<br><br>N/A<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>&gt; either normative or informative?<br>&gt;<br><br>Yes<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&gt; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>N/A. <br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>&gt; If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>&gt; the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There is currently a downref for <a href="/doc/rfc2475/">RFC 2475</a> but presumably that will be moved to Informative, or discussed here. <br>// No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>&gt; existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>&gt; in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>&gt; listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>&gt; part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>&gt; other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>&gt; explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>&gt; section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>&gt; document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>&gt; are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>&gt; Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>&gt; identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>&gt; detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>&gt; allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>&gt; reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>N/A, no IANA requests.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>&gt; allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>&gt; useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>&gt; Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>&gt; language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>&gt; <br><br>The only automated review was idnits.<br></div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Technical Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  and/or introduction of the document.

In the case of a Media Type <br>&gt;&nbsp;  review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>The DetNet WG (including David Black, DetNet Technical Advisor) have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. <br>A dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress the set of data plane drafts. <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>&gt; Personnel<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>&gt; Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&gt; the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>&gt; for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>&gt; the IESG.<br>&gt; <br><br>I have reread this document as it progressed as well as in its final form, and have personally contributed a number of suggestions, mostly grammatical details.&nbsp; All significant comments have been addressed. The document is ready for publication. <br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&gt; breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&gt; broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>&gt; DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>&gt; took place.<br>The draft was reviewed in detail by David Black with respect to backwards compatibility with Diffserv. All issues were resolved. <br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>&gt; has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>&gt; IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>&gt; with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>&gt; is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>&gt; has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>&gt; concerns here.<br><br>No concerns.&nbsp; This document is ready to be published.<br><br>&gt; (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>&gt; disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>&gt; and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>&gt; represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>&gt; being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>Very solid.&nbsp; The document (in the context of the full set of DetNet Data Plane drafts) is mature and has been discussed sufficiently among the broad DetNet WG audience.<br> <br>&gt; (10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>&gt; discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate<br>&gt; email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>&gt; separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br>&gt; <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>&gt; document. (See <a href="https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">https://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>&gt; Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>&gt; thorough.<br><br>IDNits passes without errors. <br>There are idnits warnings regarding "outdated references" but this is because this is one of a set of drafts that refer to each other and will all be published together, so the RFC editor can fix this once all edits are final.&nbsp; <br>There is also a warning "Missing Reference: 'Network' is mentioned on line 174, but not defined" - however, what Idnits is finding is the text&nbsp; “[Network]” in the figure text (which is part of a diagram) and looking for a corresponding reference, which makes no sense, i.e. this is due to a shortcoming of idnits, not the draft. <br> <br>&gt; (12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>&gt; criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>&gt;<br><br>N/A<br><br>&gt; (13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>&gt; either normative or informative?<br>&gt;<br><br>Yes<br><br>&gt; (14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>&gt; advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? <br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>N/A. <br><br>&gt; (15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>&gt; If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>&gt; the Last Call procedure. <br><br>There is currently a downref for <a href="/doc/rfc2475/">RFC 2475</a> but presumably that will be moved to Informative, or discussed here. <br>// No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>&gt; existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>&gt; in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>&gt; listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>&gt; part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>&gt; other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>&gt; explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No, N/A.<br><br>&gt; (17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>&gt; section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>&gt; document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>&gt; are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>&gt; Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>&gt; identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>&gt; detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>&gt; allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>&gt; reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>N/A, no IANA requests.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>&gt; allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>&gt; useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None.<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>&gt; Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>&gt; language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>&gt; <br><br>The only automated review was idnits.<br></div></td>

The structure of the Security Considerations sections of these (and other) DetNet drafts has been to centralize security consideration discussions in the DetNet Security Considerations draft (to avoid duplication of lengthy text in every draft), and to put only security consideration text into other drafts when there is something specific about the content of that draft that is not covered by the Security draft. We believe that we have achieved an appropriate balance between individual drafts and the Security draft, but I personally wouldn’t mind having more eyes from the Security Area on these drafts. The part that seems tricky for reviewers to understand is that we are only addressing issues that are specific to the time-sensitive behavior of IP and MPLS networks, and deferring to existing documentation all other aspects of security.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>&gt; examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>&gt; documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Technical Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be <br>&gt;&nbsp;  an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract <br>&gt;&nbsp;  or introduction.<br>This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated data.&nbsp; No DetNet-specific encapsulation is defined to support IP flows; instead, the existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to support flow identification and DetNet service delivery.&nbsp; Procedures and control information that is common to all DetNet data planes can be found in ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework.<br>&gt; Working Group Summary<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&gt;&nbsp;  example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&gt;&nbsp;  were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&gt;&nbsp;  rough?<br>There were many technical debates in the process of creating this draft, but all were resolved with a clear consensus. As an example, one point of extensive discussion was about the use of the ECN field within the IPv4 ToS field as part of the 6-tuple flow identification. It was decided to simply not say anything about the use of the ECN field, i.e. to place no requirement on it. There was no objection to this result, but it took awhile to get there. <br>&gt; Document Quality<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>The IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are used without modification. At this time there are no shipping implementations of DetNet per se. <br><br>&gt; Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to <br>&gt;&nbsp;  implement the specification? <br><br>Several major vendors have been core to the development of DetNet, including Cisco, Huawei, and Ericsson so it is assumed that they plan to implement it. <br><br>&gt; Are there any reviewers that <br>&gt;&nbsp;  merit special mention as having done a thorough review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a <br>&gt;&nbsp;  conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If <br>&gt;&nbsp;  there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, <br>&gt;&nbsp;  what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type <br>&gt;&nbsp;  review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>The DetNet WG (including David Black, DetNet Technical Advisor) have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. <br>A dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress the set of data plane drafts. <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>&gt; Personnel<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&nbsp;  Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>&gt; Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; (3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>&gt; the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>&gt; for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>&gt; the IESG.<br>&gt; <br><br>I have reread this document as it progressed as well as in its final form, and have personally contributed a number of suggestions, mostly grammatical details.&nbsp; All significant comments have been addressed. The document is ready for publication. <br><br>&gt; (4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>&gt; breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No.<br><br>&gt; (5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>&gt; broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>&gt; DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>&gt; took place.<br>Regarding security considerations, in my role as Editor of the DeteNet Security Considerations draft, I have endeavored to draw as much review of the security considerations of the DetNet Data Plane and DetNet Security drafts as we could convince anyone to perform. The structure of the Security Considerations sections of these (and other) DetNet drafts has been to centralize security consideration discussions in the DetNet Security Considerations draft (to avoid duplication of lengthy text in every draft), and to put only security consideration text into other drafts when there is something specific about the content of that draft that is not covered by the Security draft. We believe that we have achieved an appropriate balance between individual drafts and the Security draft, but I personally wouldn’t mind having more eyes from the Security Area on these drafts. The part that seems tricky for reviewers to understand is that we are only addressing issues that are specific to the time-sensitive behavior of IP and MPLS networks, and deferring to existing documentation all other aspects of security. In other words, identifying and addressing only time-sensitive behavior and explicitly excluding other discussion is a challenge. <br><br>&gt; (6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>&gt; has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>&gt; IESG should be aware of?
