As happens with some other things in our societies as well, the IETF discussion focused more on the process than practical ways of helping those who need help. The final version of the draft does have text about the important function of the Ombudsteam being to provide advice and counsel for participants (Sect. 4). The formal duties are there for the situations that need it, but I consider our earlier policy statement and that counsel function as the most important things we have done in this matter.<br><br>The last discuss was from Stephen, on points that I sympathise with. I think though that on the point about the aspirational goal you are perhaps right but also in the rough :-) With regards to the statement regarding laws, my read of that statement is that it binds the IETF very little, but our legal advice recommended it be included, for reasons that I think are reasonable. I do think though that the likelihood of that statement affecting our situation in any way was small.<br><br>I have decided that the current language should stay.<br><br>As this is now approved, we have an important task of setting up the team and associated machinery.

I'm entirely happy that the authors have been<br>trying to handle the usual diverse IETF participant input<br>so me moving to abstain is just one of those things and <br>does not mean I think the ombudsteam process being <br>established is flawed. The document has ended up with<br>sufficient flaws though that me abstaining and getting out <br>of the way is the better path.<br><br>My last discuss text (prior to abstaining is below).<br><br>START last-discuss-text<br><br>I've chatted (via IM) with Pete about the -10 version and I<br>cleared point 3, we agreed that point 2 is for Jari to go and<br>check with the lawyers, (or to decide to not do that) and we<br>developed a set of OLD/NEW changes for points 1, 4 and 5.<br>My plan is to move to a yes if all of those go my way, but to<br>an abstain if not (with the relevant remaining discuss points <br>turned into comments). <br><br>(1) section 2: calling out creating an environment that is<br>intimidating as a form of harassment goes too far I think.<br>It is in the nature of the IETF to be intimidating to non<br>engineers or to less qualified engineers. Feeling intimidated<br>because one is ignorant and where nobody is trying to do harm<br>is something that is ok. Trying to intimidate is not ok,<br>attempting to intimidate because someone is young, old, etc.<br>is not ok, but that was already stated. <br>IM with Pete suggested this OLD/NEW which'd work for me<br>if the authors are ok with it:<br>OLD:<br><br>&nbsp; This document concerns itself with harassment that has the purpose or<br>&nbsp;  effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation<br>&nbsp;  in IETF activities or of creating an environment within the IETF that<br>&nbsp;  would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive in such a situation.<br><br>NEW:<br>&nbsp;  This document concerns itself with harassment that has the purpose or<br>&nbsp;  effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's participation<br>&nbsp;  in IETF activities or harassment which creates an environment within the IETF that<br>&nbsp;  would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive.<br><br>(2) section 2, last para: I do not want the IETF to be<br>subject to all the laws of all countries all at once. <br>This seems to assert that and that there is IETF<br>consensus for that assertion. I don't believe either<br>is true and believe this sentence should be deleted.<br>There are some possibly relevant laws in some countries that<br>are such that the IETF can't reasonably ask me to agree with<br>those.&nbsp; Put another way: I read this as saying that we're asserting<br>that at any given time the IETF will have consensus on the <br>relevance of every applicable law everywhere. I do not think <br>such an IETF consensus exists or can exist.<br>In an IM chat with Pete, we ended up figuring expressing this<br>point like this might help "We don’t want the ombuds to have <br>to figure out which of all possible laws in the world are applicable, <br>and this sentence doesn’t add anything really, since the ombuds <br>get to decide how to handle any complaint, whether it falls <br>under any definition or not. So let’s just strike the sentence."<br>So this one is now for Jari to ask Lawyer: given the above<br>interpretation, wouldn't it be better to remove the sentence<br>since it could do harm and not match IETF consensus if included?<br><br>(3) cleared<br><br>(4) 5.1, 2nd last para: respect has to be earned it's not ok to <br>just say "ombudsteam =&gt; correct" for such a new construct. I <br>think this kind of text might be enough to be problematic <br>if/when someone goes to court and claims these are unfair <br>procedures.<br>A suggested OLD/NEW:<br>OLD:<br>&nbsp;  It should be enough that the Ombudsteam explains<br>&nbsp;  the severity of the situation, that they have considered other lesser&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  remedies, and that they deem the recommended remedy to be&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  appropriate.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As the Ombudsteam function is seen to be improving the IETF <br>&nbsp;  and gains the respect of participants over time, <br>&nbsp;  it should be enough that the Ombudsteam explains<br>&nbsp;  the severity of the situation, that they have considered other lesser&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  remedies, and that they deem the recommended remedy to be&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  appropriate.<br><br>(5) 5.2: purpose "is to prevent all" - that's nonsense, there<br>is no point in setting an impossible purpose.&nbsp; The purpose<br>surely is to minimise harassment and the impact if harassment<br>has occurred? If this BCP makes such impossible claims, and<br>if someone does ever end up in court, I would expect that<br>this BCP could not be defended. That seems like a bad<br>plan to me. <br>The following change would however fix this:<br>OLD<br>is to prevent all<br>NEW<br>is to deal with and discourage<br><br>END last-discuss-text, old non-discuss comments are <br>below here.<br><br>(I didn't check -10 against these comments - I'm fine to chat<br>more about them if the authors want but I suspect we'd all<br>prefer to get this out the door instead.)<br><br>Some of my comments on the changed text here are close to<br>discusses, but I think if we resolve the discusses then we'll<br>hopefully also fix what needs fixing below.<br><br>- intro, 2nd last para: I'd prefer s/intended/only intended/<br>I do think we should ensure that the ombudsteam can't get out<br>of control, to the extent any formalism would help there.<br><br>- section 2, 3rd last para: What is the sentence starting<br>with "One way..." supposed to mean? Are you trying to get at<br>situations where someone demands favours of some kind (e.g.<br>sexual?) in return for doing what they ought in any case do?<br>I don't think it's useful to be unclear like that.<br><br>- 3.5: Say if someone refuses to accept that a report has<br>been dealt with for 5 years. Does the lead ombudsbeing<br>continue to be part of the team for all of that time? Do they<br>only handle the existing "case"? Is there no way to hand off<br>and finally free our poor ombudsbeing in such a case? (There<br>will be reporters who don't want to let go, and that could be<br>a problem for team members.) Just extending the term isn't a<br>good plan I believe.<br><br>- 4.1: The respondent is not obliged to co-operate is a<br>tautology and should be omitted. "May consider failure to<br>co-operate" sounds a bit too threatening and is it really<br>needed or useful here? <br><br>- 4.1: All reports in writing? Why? I think that's a detail<br>for the ombudsteam and they ought be allowed to decide that a<br>word in the ear is the most effective thing to do. I of<br>course agree that all reports of substance need to be dealt<br>with in writing, but even in that case, I don't think you<br>mean that the reporter has to use writing to report.<br><br>- 5.1: Why does 5.1 say "Per section 5.1"? <br><br>- 5.1: The two places you say that folks are not qualified<br>are not needed (recall ctte and appointing body) and are I<br>think counterproductive. Any such set of IETFers is actually<br>reasonably likely to have some qualified folks and some not.<br>(And for everyone to believe themselves qualified.) I think<br>you want to say that (over time) we ought (grow to) respect<br>the ombudsteam decisions which is a good goal, (over time)<br>but one that can only be reached (over time) with good<br>demonstrated performance and respect can't just be declared<br>to be required.<br><br>- 5.1: The AD specific bullet is odd.&nbsp; What if the remedy is<br>to be applied to an IAB programme lead or liaison manager or<br>directorate secretary? I think you could generalise, but at<br>that point it's probably so obvious as to not need saying.<br>Maybe delete that bullet.<br><br>- 5.1, the last-resort bit: this is good but I think s/should<br>consider/must consider/ is needed there. I can't see there<br>being a case where the ombudsbeing wouldn't consider a lesser<br>remedy and if they ever get to the last resort they really<br>had better have documented (internally) that they did<br>consider lesser remedies.<br><br>- section 8: this is not only a summary, the last point<br>was not previously made. I didn't check all the others.<br><br>comments on text previously reviewed:<br><br>- section 2: the term "potential harrassment" is weird, esp<br>in "reports potential harrassment" - this would allow a<br>reporter Bob to say that Charlie might be able to harrass<br>Alice. That is always true.<br><br>- 3.1: The 1st and 2nd sentences here contradict one another.<br>Rewording can fix, e.g. s/shall/ought/ and s/will rapidly/<br>should rapidly/<br><br>- 3.2: "may consider elements of diversity" is bogus. Of<br>course the IETF chair can do that. If we want the IETF chair<br>to do so, we should say they ought, not that they may. Strike<br>this or s/may/ought/<br><br>- section 4: Will normal web access logs to related web pages<br>be kept? Maybe this'd be better on another domain?<br><br>- 4.1: The ombudsteam set their own procedures but if the<br>community are unhappy with those the only recourse is the<br>(never used) recall for the IETF chair? That's not going to<br>happen. I think you're missing a middle step where the IETF<br>chair should fire the ombudsteam if the community don't<br>accept team practices and the team don't fix those in<br>response.<br><br>- 4.1: This dives into too much detail in a number of ways.<br>Let the team figure out those details.&nbsp; E.g., saying "do like<br>nomcom" is a bit strong here, I'd allow the team to decide<br>that. They could e.g.&nbsp; prefer to use some kind of<br>whistleblower technology and no email at all. (The statement<br>isn't entirely broken as-is, but is also not needed.) One<br>could maybe say that the team need to be at least as careful<br>as nomcom should be.<br><br>- 4.1: The shall in "shall not be subject to retaliation" is<br>wishful thinking. Nobody can control that. I think you want<br>to say that good-faith reports ought not by themselves be<br>considered a negative and that this is something on which the<br>IETF has consensus.</div></td>

Are you trying to get at<br>situations where someone demands favours of some kind (e.g.<br>sexual?) in return for doing what they ought in any case do?<br>I don't think it's useful to be unclear like that.<br><br>- 3.5: Say if someone refuses to accept that a report has<br>been dealt with for 5 years. Does the lead ombudsbeing<br>continue to be part of the team for all of that time? Do they<br>only handle the existing "case"? Is there no way to hand off<br>and finally free our poor ombudsbeing in such a case? (There<br>will be reporters who don't want to let go, and that could be<br>a problem for team members.) Just extending the term isn't a<br>good plan I believe.<br><br>- 4.1: The respondent is not obliged to co-operate is a<br>tautology and should be omitted. "May consider failure to<br>co-operate" sounds a bit too threatening and is it really<br>needed or useful here? <br><br>- 4.1: All reports in writing? Why? I think that's a detail<br>for the ombudsteam and they ought be allowed to decide that a<br>word in the ear is the most effective thing to do. I of<br>course agree that all reports of substance need to be dealt<br>with in writing, but even in that case, I don't think you<br>mean that the reporter has to use writing to report.<br><br>- 5.1: Why does 5.1 say "Per section 5.1"? <br><br>- 5.1: The two places you say that folks are not qualified<br>are not needed (recall ctte and appointing body) and are I<br>think counterproductive. Any such set of IETFers is actually<br>reasonably likely to have some qualified folks and some not.<br>(And for everyone to believe themselves qualified.) I think<br>you want to say that (over time) we ought (grow to) respect<br>the ombudsteam decisions which is a good goal, (over time)<br>but one that can only be reached (over time) with good<br>demonstrated performance and respect can't just be declared<br>to be required.<br><br>- 5.1: The AD specific bullet is odd.&nbsp; What if the remedy is<br>to be applied to an IAB programme lead or liaison manager or<br>directorate secretary? I think you could generalise, but at<br>that point it's probably so obvious as to not need saying.<br>Maybe delete that bullet.<br><br>- 5.1, the last-resort bit: this is good but I think s/should<br>consider/must consider/ is needed there. I can't see there<br>being a case where the ombudsbeing wouldn't consider a lesser<br>remedy and if they ever get to the last resort they really<br>had better have documented (internally) that they did<br>consider lesser remedies.<br><br>- section 8: this is not only a summary, the last point<br>was not previously made. I didn't check all the others.<br><br>comments on text previously reviewed:<br><br>- section 2: the term "potential harrassment" is weird, esp<br>in "reports potential harrassment" - this would allow a<br>reporter Bob to say that Charlie might be able to harrass<br>Alice. That is always true.<br><br>- 3.1: The 1st and 2nd sentences here contradict one another.<br>Rewording can fix, e.g. s/shall/ought/ and s/will rapidly/<br>should rapidly/<br><br>- 3.2: "may consider elements of diversity" is bogus. Of<br>course the IETF chair can do that. If we want the IETF chair<br>to do so, we should say they ought, not that they may. Strike<br>this or s/may/ought/<br><br>- section 4: Will normal web access logs to related web pages<br>be kept? Maybe this'd be better on another domain?<br><br>- 4.1: The ombudsteam set their own procedures but if the<br>community are unhappy with those the only recourse is the<br>(never used) recall for the IETF chair? That's not going to<br>happen. I think you're missing a middle step where the IETF<br>chair should fire the ombudsteam if the community don't<br>accept team practices and the team don't fix those in<br>response.<br><br>- 4.1: This dives into too much detail in a number of ways.<br>Let the team figure out those details.&nbsp; E.g., saying "do like<br>nomcom" is a bit strong here, I'd allow the team to decide<br>that. They could e.g.&nbsp; prefer to use some kind of<br>whistleblower technology and no email at all. (The statement<br>isn't entirely broken as-is, but is also not needed.) One<br>could maybe say that the team need to be at least as careful<br>as nomcom should be.<br><br>- 4.1: The shall in "shall not be subject to retaliation" is<br>wishful thinking. Nobody can control that. I think you want<br>to say that good-faith reports ought not by themselves be<br>considered a negative and that this is something on which the<br>IETF has consensus.</div></td>

Feeling intimidated<br>because one is ignorant and where nobody is trying to do harm<br>is something that is ok. Trying to intimidate is not ok,<br>attempting to intimidate because someone is young, old, etc.<br>is not ok, but that was already stated. I think you need to<br>strike the text about "creating an environment that would be<br>intimidating." <br><br>In an IM chat with Pete, we ended up figuring expressing this<br>point like this might help "We don’t want the ombuds to have <br>to figure out which of all possible laws in the world are applicable, <br>and this sentence doesn’t add anything really, since the ombuds <br>get to decide how to handle any complaint, whether it falls <br>under any definition or not. So let’s just strike the sentence."<br>If we got that result, I'd be fine with that rationale for doing<br>the right thing:-)<br>(2) section 2, last para: I do not want the IETF to be<br>subject to the laws of all countries. This seems to do that.<br>There are some possibly relevant laws in some countries that<br>are such that the IETF can't reasonably ask me to agree with<br>those. This sentence should go, or should say something else.<br>Put another way: I read this as saying that we're asserting<br>that the IETF has consensus on every applicable law<br>everywhere. I do not think such an IETF consensus exists.<br><br>(3) 5.1: The recall ctte can't re-evaluate? That is plain<br>odd.&nbsp; Once matters are public to that extent I think that<br>forces a re-evaluation for the sake of fairness.&nbsp; In cases<br>where e.g.&nbsp; the IESG can quietly ask a chair to step aside<br>that's not an issue, but it certainly would be with a public<br>recall. A claim that the recall ctte aren't qualified is not<br>enough to justify a potentially unfair public process like<br>that IMO.<br><br>(4) 5.1, 2nd last para: respect has to be earned it's not ok to <br>just say "ombudsteam =&gt; correct" for such a new construct. I <br>think this kind of text might be enough to be problematic <br>if/when someone goes to court and claims these are unfair <br>procedures.<br><br>(5) 5.2: purpose "is to prevent all" - that's nonsense, there<br>is no point in setting an impossible purpose.&nbsp; The purpose<br>surely is to minimise harassment and the impact if harassment<br>has occurred? If this BCP makes such impossible claims, and<br>if someone does ever end up in court, I would expect that<br>this BCP could not be defended. That seems like a bad<br>plan to me.&nbsp; "make sure" and "ensure" in the 2nd para are<br>also overstated.</div></td>

I do regret that. It seems inappropriate to hold it up at this stage and given how much discussion has taken place.<br><br>When discussions about developing an anti-harassment policy first began I was in favor of the idea for two reasons. First, I thought we could improve the experience of attending IETF meetings by having a trusted person or people whom attendees could talk to and possibly strategize with if the attendees had experienced harassment. Second, I thought it was important to establish publicly the expectation that all attendees be treated with dignity, decency, and respect. The IESG policy accomplishes the second of these goals and this document seems aimed at accomplishing the first, among other things.<br><br>I do not believe the document accomplishes the first goal, however. This is because the procedures as outlined turn what could have been the key incremental improvement -- having a trusted person for attendees to talk to -- into a legalistic pile of process and communications that I believe will deter victims of harassment from making use of the system at all. When I have a sensitive incident to report, I want to report it to a single person whom I trust. I do not want to have to agree a priori to having that information shared with a team of three people, nor do I want to be re-directed to some other person who I perhaps trust less. I do not want the person to whom I report it to write it down. I just want to talk it through with the person. Then, if we both agree that some further course of action is warranted, I want to be involved in deciding what course of action I am comfortable with, and I want to continue to be involved in deciding whether to proceed at every step of the way, including steps that involve informing ADs, the secretariat, and other parties. I want to reserve the right to change my mind at any time. The problem with the document as written is that it severely disenfranchises the victim of the harassment, to the point where I expect that most victims would be afraid to actually make use of the procedures outlined in the document. Being harassed can be scary. The policies outlined in the document have utterly failed to account for that.<br><br>Furthermore, the document in sections 5.1 and 6 contemplates all manner of scenarios that may or may not come to pass and specifies detailed procedures for how to handle them. In practice I expect that there are probably scenarios we haven't thought of that will arise, while the ones for which detailed procedures have been specified might never get used. I wish we could have started with an incremental approach that achieves the two goals stated above, and then checked in after some implementation experience to see where the gaps are and what needs beefing up procedurally. Instead we are going from no process to an over-specified process without any implementation experience to build on.<br><br>I hope I'm wrong about the potential utility of the process specified in the document, but I cannot support it as written.</div></td>

Feeling intimidated<br>because one is ignorant and where nobody is trying to do harm<br>is something that is ok. Trying to intimidate is not ok,<br>attempting to intimidate because someone is young, old, etc.<br>is not ok, but that was already stated. I think you need to<br>strike the text about "creating an environment that would be<br>intimidating."<br><br>(2) section 2, last para: I do not want the IETF to be<br>subject to the laws of all countries. This seems to do that.<br>There are some possibly relevant laws in some countries that<br>are such that the IETF can't reasonably ask me to agree with<br>those. This sentence should go, or should say something else.<br>Put another way: I read this as saying that we're asserting<br>that the IETF has consensus on every applicable law<br>everywhere. I do not think such an IETF consensus exists.<br><br>(3) 5.1: The recall ctte can't re-evaluate? That is plain<br>odd.&nbsp; Once matters are public to that extent I think that<br>forces a re-evaluation for the sake of fairness.&nbsp; In cases<br>where e.g.&nbsp; the IESG can quietly ask a chair to step aside<br>that's not an issue, but it certainly would be with a public<br>recall. A claim that the recall ctte aren't qualified is not<br>enough to justify a potentially unfair public process like<br>that IMO.<br><br>(4) 5.1, 2nd last para: respect has to be earned it's not ok to <br>just say "ombudsteam =&gt; correct" for such a new construct. I <br>think this kind of text might be enough to be problematic <br>if/when someone goes to court and claims these are unfair <br>procedures.<br><br>(5) 5.2: purpose "is to prevent all" - that's nonsense, there<br>is no point in setting an impossible purpose.&nbsp; The purpose<br>surely is to minimise harassment and the impact if harassment<br>has occurred? If this BCP makes such impossible claims, and<br>if someone does ever end up in court, I would expect that<br>this BCP could not be defended. That seems like a bad<br>plan to me.&nbsp; "make sure" and "ensure" in the 2nd para are<br>also overstated.</div></td>

"May consider failure to<br>co-operate" sounds a bit too threatening and is it really<br>needed or useful here? <br><br>- 4.1: All reports in writing? Why? I think that's a detail<br>for the ombudsteam and they ought be allowed to decide that a<br>word in the ear is the most effective thing to do. I of<br>course agree that all reports of substance need to be dealt<br>with in writing, but even in that case, I don't think you<br>mean that the reporter has to use writing to report.<br><br>- 5.1: Why does 5.1 say "Per section 5.1"? <br><br>- 5.1: The two places you say that folks are not qualified<br>are not needed (recall ctte and appointing body) and are I<br>think counterproductive. Any such set of IETFers is actually<br>reasonably likely to have some qualified folks and some not.<br>(And for everyone to believe themselves qualified.) I think<br>you want to say that (over time) we ought (grow to) respect<br>the ombudsteam decisions which is a good goal, (over time)<br>but one that can only be reached (over time) with good<br>demonstrated performance and respect can't just be declared<br>to be required.<br><br>- 5.1: The AD specific bullet is odd.&nbsp; What if the remedy is<br>to be applied to an IAB programme lead or liaison manager or<br>directorate secretary? I think you could generalise, but at<br>that point it's probably so obvious as to not need saying.<br>Maybe delete that bullet.<br><br>- 5.1, the last-resort bit: this is good but I think s/should<br>consider/must consider/ is needed there. I can't see there<br>being a case where the ombudsbeing wouldn't consider a lesser<br>remedy and if they ever get to the last resort they really<br>had better have documented (internally) that they did<br>consider lesser remedies.<br><br>- section 8: this is not only a summary, the last point<br>was not previously made. I didn't check all the others.<br><br>comments on text previously reviewed:<br><br>- section 2: the term "potential harrassment" is weird, esp<br>in "reports potential harrassment" - this would allow a<br>reporter Bob to say that Charlie might be able to harrass<br>Alice.

Of<br>course the IETF chair can do that. If we want the IETF chair<br>to do so, we should say they ought, not that they may. Strike<br>this or s/may/ought/<br><br>- section 4: Will normal web access logs to related web pages<br>be kept? Maybe this'd be better on another domain?<br><br>- 4.1: The ombudsteam set their own procedures but if the<br>community are unhappy with those the only recourse is the<br>(never used) recall for the IETF chair? That's not going to<br>happen. I think you're missing a middle step where the IETF<br>chair should fire the ombudsteam if the community don't<br>accept team practices and the team don't fix those in<br>response.<br><br>- 4.1: This dives into too much detail in a number of ways.<br>Let the team figure out those details.&nbsp; E.g., saying "do like<br>nomcom" is a bit strong here, I'd allow the team to decide<br>that. They could e.g.&nbsp; prefer to use some kind of<br>whistleblower technology and no email at all. (The statement<br>isn't entirely broken as-is, but is also not needed.) One<br>could maybe say that the team need to be at least as careful<br>as nomcom should be.<br><br>- 4.1: The shall in "shall not be subject to retaliation" is<br>wishful thinking.

Others are small, but subtle. I <br>recommend reading the whole document, but if you want to look only<br>at changes, I suggest you diff against -05, the version that was updated<br>after IETF last call and went to the IESG for evaluation<br><br>In checking to see what changes were made and whether they addressed <br>your comments, please bear in mind that there were a lot of comments <br>made in a conversational manner and it was quite hard to round them <br>up and determine exactly what changes needed to be made. Ines did a <br>great job helping as Shepherd, but if we have missed something you <br>said, it is not because we are ignoring you: it's just that we lost the <br>point amongst other comments and discussions.<br><br>Additionally, I'd ask you to think about whether what we have is "good <br>enough" to act as a starting point. I'm conscious that we have been <br>debating having this piece of process for a long time and that my <br>personal preference is to get something going (a beta release?) and <br>then tune it as we go forwards. In the light of that I know that <br>consensus on some parts of the document may be a little rough. <br>This mainly happens when the opinions on an issue are very <br>divergent and not easily brought together. I hope that we have <br>done a good job at building bridges, but will not be surprised <br>or upset if some of you are not happy.<br><br>I'm responsible for most of the edits in this round (with <br>assistance from multiple people) so please blame me <br>(and complain about me to Pete) for any nonsense.<br><br>As to process, I suggest that this document needs to be<br>taken around for another IETF last call, but I leave that<br>to Jari as the responsible AD.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Adrian<br><br>------<br><br>In summary...<br><br>Abstract: clarify the nature of updates to existing RFCs.<br><br>Introduction: s/interpersonal/personal/<br><br>Definitions: Clarify that the definition of harassment is deliberately not<br>a closed list.<br><br>Definitions: Add a paragraph (loosely based on the IEEE's equivalent<br>policy) to scope when harassment applies within the IETF.<br><br>Definitions: Add a clause recommended by our lawyers about applicable law.<br><br>Ombudsteam: Clarify "recompense" to mean "compensation from the IETF".<br><br>Term of Service: Add paragraph for when an Ombudsperson's term ends <br>while they are acting as Lead Ombudsperson .<br><br>Term of Service: Add a note about likelihood of reappointment.<br><br>Compensation: Clarify "recompense" to mean "compensation from the IETF".<br><br>Removal: Expand the times that an Ombudsperson can be removed.<br><br>Handling Reports: Fix email address and URL.<br><br>Handling Reports: Clarify that remedies are imposed only after <br>completing investigations.<br><br>Operating Practices: Expand on confidentiality expectations.<br><br>Operating Practices: Clarify that the Respondent is contacted and <br>given an opportunity to interact before a remedy is imposed.<br><br>Operating Practices: Add when the Ombudsteam must commit things to writing.<br><br>Remedies: Add that mediation ned not be an end point.<br><br>Remedies: Show how remedies may be actioned through the Secretariat or IAD.<br><br>Remedies for Respondents in IETF Positions: Add substantial new section.<br><br>Purpose of Remedies: Expand on the details and theme of "not as <br>punishment" remedies.<br><br>Confidentiality: Add new section to describe expectations.<br><br>Acknowledgements: What a lot of you have helped with this document!</div></td>

Is she ok?<br><br>I have sent the draft to IAOC as the commitments for IETF funds should not come as a surprise to them.<br><br>In the meantime I have adopted the draft and performed an AD review.<br><br>I think it is ready to move forward, but I do have a couple of comments that might require changes. Please see below, most of these are question marks, and I might have missed something obvious. Let me know what you think. I’ve chatted a bit about these with Pete. I think he was fine with two first suggested changes, agreed there was an issue in the third (but it could be addressed in different ways), and he disagreed with the fourth one.<br><br>I have absolutely no problem with the two “open” issues.<br><br>I’m a bit concerned about the level of process implied for selections. <br><br>&nbsp; The appointment is<br>&nbsp; solely the responsibility of the IETF Chair although the Chair may<br>&nbsp; choose to consult with the IESG, the IAB, and with the ISOC Board of<br>&nbsp; Trustees.&nbsp; Furthermore, the IETF Chair may take opinion from the<br>&nbsp; community.<br><br>Which I think is formally fine. But if I were now to select some people with a call for volunteers, but not, e.g., consult one of the above leadership boards, would that be taken negatively? Or what if I ask ISOC CEO and not the board? I think you are being unnecessarily broad in the list above. Perhaps it would be better to generalise the text a bit and just say:<br><br>&nbsp; The appointment is<br>&nbsp; solely the responsibility of the IETF Chair although the Chair may<br>&nbsp; choose to consult with the IETF or ISOC leadership, or listen for<br>&nbsp; feedback from the community.<br><br>I’m also a bit wary about strong language regarding commitment to provide training. Of course we will provide training. However, do we really want to say<br><br>&nbsp; Since all of these attributes may be regarded<br>&nbsp; by the IETF Chair as essential for an appointment, the IETF is<br>&nbsp; committed to provide funding for necessary training for appointed<br>&nbsp; Ombudspersons.&nbsp; <br><br>since I’m not sure all necessary training means, and we do not want to ask for our professional advisers to recommend training under all possible circumstances but rather what is reasonable for our situation. Also, we should be allowed to provide training rather than funding, if it suits our situation better. Finally, a team is a team and probably consists of people with complementary skills, even if basic ability to deal with these complex situations is necessary for everyone.<br><br>Suggested new wording:<br><br>&nbsp; Since all of these attributes may be regarded<br>&nbsp; by the IETF Chair as essential for the team, the IETF is<br>&nbsp; committed to providing training (or funding for it) deemed necessary for each of<br>&nbsp; the individual appointed Ombudspersons.&nbsp; <br><br>It seems that there should always be a way to remove Ombudspersons by someone, even the IETF chair would be recused. But the text below seems to preclude that. Consider the degenerate case of IETF chair being the Reporter and one of the Ombudspersons being the Respondent.<br><br>&nbsp; An Ombudsperson shall not be removed from service, even if their term<br>&nbsp; has expired, if the IETF Chair is recused as described in <br>&nbsp; Section 7<br><br>And in any case, the above text seems like a duplicate in some ways, because if, say, the IETF chair is recused, then at least the IETF chair is not removing anyone. I have no good text suggestion, but maybe I’m just misunderstanding something.<br><br>Pete says that once a case is closed, an Ombudsperson could be removed (eg., in my degenerate example above). That is a way to handle the situation, but even that might benefit from some explanation in the draft. There might be other approaches.<br><br>Finally, in other appeals we often have had a lead appeal handling AD. I’ve found such delegation useful. I’m not trying to evade the responsibility to deal with the harassment case appeals, but I wonder if it would be reasonable to leave room delegation of an appeal within the IESG? The text below seems to preclude this.<br><br>&nbsp; In the event that there is an appeal and the IETF Chair is somehow<br>&nbsp; involved, the Chair will immediately recuse themself and the IESG<br>&nbsp; will select a single person to take the Chair's role in the appeal<br>&nbsp; process.<br><br>You could perhaps say also “The IETF Chair may also, with the agreement of the IESG, delegate a specific appeal to be handled by another IESG member."<br></div></td>
