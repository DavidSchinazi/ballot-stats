Section 5 provides the considerations for selecting prefixes. However, those considerations are incomplete. <a href="/doc/rfc7421/">RFC 7421</a> provides the analysis for the use of the /64 boundary.&nbsp; The Homenet Architecture (<a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC 7368</a>) discusses various Homenet-related issues around not getting sufficient address space to allocate /64 prefixes to links. <a href="/doc/rfc6164/">RFC 6164</a> discusses the use of 127-bit prefixes on point-to-point links. Why does this section not mention any of these considerations when selecting a prefix?<br><br>2. I am raising Alvaro's point about the impact of topology changes to a DISCUSS.&nbsp; I think there needs to be sufficient discussion in the document on the impact of topology changes on the prefix assignment algorithm and the impact of changing prefix assignments on nodes in the network. This ties in to the point raised by Brian Carpenter on the claim in the Introduction that this algorithm can be used in "fully autonomic as well as professionally managed networks". This is especially true when convergence is described as occurring "eventually".<br><br>3. I understand that this document became standalone when the HNCP and DNCP documents split. What dependencies/assumptions does this document have on either one of them?&nbsp; There appears to be some assumptions on the Node ID and the flood algorithm.<br><br>4. How does the algorithm deal with prefix delegations that have holes (e.g. <a href="/doc/rfc6603/">RFC6603</a>)? This text seems to preclude such delegations.<br><br>5. Section 6 discusses Listener nodes. Does there need to be some discussion/warning about links that consist of all Listeners?&nbsp; The link will not get a prefix assigned to it in such a situation.<br><br>6. How does this approach deal with asynchronous link state changes?</div></td>

Comments that are not addressed in last call may be included in AD reviews during the IESG review.&nbsp; Document editors and WG chairs should treat these comments just like any other last call comments. <br><br>Overall, I believe the draft is ready with minor issues, mainly around presentation and clarity.<br><br>As one part of the proposed HNCP protocol, having this distributed prefix distribution algorithm documented is a Good Thing.<br><br>Homenet has considered previous work in this area, e.g.both <a href="/doc/draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment/04/">draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-04</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-baker-homenet-prefix-assignment/01/">draft-baker-homenet-prefix-assignment-01</a> have been discussed in homenet. While those don’t need to be cited, it’s worth noting that homenet has been seeking a self-configuring prefix distribution mechanism for some time (3-4 years).<br><br>General comments:<br><br>The draft very much throws the reader in at the deep end. It would be very useful if a high-level description of the philosophy of the algorithm were included in the introduction, such that those principles are in the reader’s mind when they read through the remainder of the document, including the description of the algorithm.<br><br>Related, there is very little content in the draft. It does not cite or mention that it is used by HNCP, nor does it cite <a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC 7368</a>. There is no text describing (even just briefly) why this approach is favoured, or any rationale why this approach is most favoured for HNCP (or regarding the claimed convergence). If those are documented elsewhere, a link/reference would be useful for the reader.<br><br>Regarding <a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC 7368</a>, the draft could claim compliance with that RFC, in particular Section 3.4.3, given the support for assigned prefix stability described within the draft. Given it is a homenet draft, this would seem appropriate.<br><br>Because the draft describes an algorithm, rather than a detailed protocol, many parts of the document omit specifics, e.g. the format of a Node ID, or of the flooded messages. If the document aims to provide the means for a developer to build an implementation of HNCP, this could be problematic. Are these formats going to be described elsewhere, or are they already described somewhere?<br><br>What happens if there are not enough prefixes to assign a prefix to each Link? Is there still convergence? What is the failure mode here? <a href="/doc/rfc7368/">RFC 7368</a> considers this an ‘error’ mode that needs to be indicated to the user. Or would you state an assumption of enough prefixes? Some brief explicit discussion of this, early in the text, would be useful. At present it’s hinted at at the end of Section 4.2 and end of Section 6.<br><br>The Terminology section could precede the Introduction for clarity.<br><br>Specific comments:<br><br>Page 1:<br>What does “or for other private purposes?” mean in the abstract?<br><br>Perhaps the abstract can mention that the algorithm can support prefix stability over reboot given the presence of stable storage.<br><br>What does ‘eventually converges’ mean?<br><br>Page 2:<br>Line 3 of introduction, ‘prefix’ rather than ‘prefixes’.<br><br>As a homenet draft, should ‘professionally managed networks’ be mentioned here?&nbsp; Maybe say “as well as other deployment scenarios”?<br><br>Page 3:<br>How is the flooding mechanism made reliable? Or is that down to the method of implementation?<br><br>Page 6:<br>Is this really an applicability statement? I think of something more general here, by default, which this isn’t.<br><br>Terms such as 'non-overlapping’ and ‘disjoint’ are used - perhaps be consistent.<br><br>Page 7:<br>At the top, perhaps also mention here that in the moment context ULA prefixes might also be configured by this method, alongside globally unique prefixes.<br><br>As an aside - where a moment has two routers advertising a /48 ULA, can this algorithm be used to pick only one to use, or would it by default create prefix assignments on each Link for each 48?<br><br>Page 8:<br>The term ‘considered’ is introduced a little abruptly here in the first bullet point of 4.1.<br><br>Page 9:<br>It may be better for ADOPT_MAX_DELAY and BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY to be explained earlier, rather than forward referenced to Section 7.<br><br>Page 10:<br>‘is not valid’ - maybe that should be ‘is not Valid’, matching the upper case used in the terminology section?<br><br>Page 12:<br>So if the upstream ISP goes away, what happens? Do all Links become unnumbered for global prefixes, continuing to use ULAs if configured? Some clarity here would be nice.<br><br>Page 13:<br>For Randomness, is there a privacy aspect here, that a homenet or a network using this algorithm may choose to randomise prefixes internally over time for privacy reasons (ignoring the complexity that may be introduced elsewhere as a result)? We have considered IID and link layer address randomisation elsewhere recently; this could be argued as another tool in that toolbox. Though adding such text with subsequent comments may lead to delays in publication :)<br><br>Page 16:<br>I don’t think the Node ID assignment mechanism has been described anywhere?<br><br>The security considerations do not hint at any solution for the noted threats. There are of course comparative threats to similar algorithms.<br><br>Tim<br><br><br><br>_______________________________________________<br>OPS-DIR mailing list<br><a href="mailto:OPS-DIR@ietf.org">OPS-DIR@ietf.org</a><br><a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ops-dir">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ops-dir</a></div></td>

(Applicability Statement) you wrote that the "algorithm supports dynamically changing topologies”.&nbsp; <br><br>What are then topology changes that may result in renumbering being unavoidable?<br><br><br>(2) To Destroy.&nbsp; The term “destroy” is used in several places, but it is not defined in Section 2.&nbsp; It looks like Section 4.2. (Overriding and Destroying Existing Assignments) might define it, but instead it uses “destroy” to to define “Removing an Assigned Prefix”.&nbsp; Destroy seems to be the local action that may result in removing a Published Assigned Prefix.&nbsp; Please add to the terminology.<br><br><br>(3) Unique Node IDs.&nbsp; Having unique Node IDs is important to break ties in the algorithm.&nbsp; However, the text seems to allow the existence of duplicate IDs for some (undefined) period of time.&nbsp; Section 3. (Applicability Statement) reads: "Node IDs MAY change over time and be the same on multiple Nodes at some point, but each Node MUST eventually have a Node ID which is unique among the set of participating Nodes.”&nbsp;  How long is “eventually”?&nbsp;  The sentence is (at best) confusing, but it reads as contradicting to me: If multiple Nodes can have the same ID, how can the MUST be enforced?&nbsp;  You mention in the Security Considerations section that an “attacker. . .using a Node ID used by another Node may prevent the correctness and convergence of the algorithm. . .”&nbsp; Allowing for multiple Nodes to have the same ID is then an attack for however long “eventually” is.<br><br>The same type of language (“eventually” and “at some point”) is used on other places.&nbsp; It would be nice to tighten the text up (where appropriate); for example, the part about “Each Node MUST have a set of non-overlapping Delegated Prefixes..” seems to be ok as it doesn’t mention that at some point the Delegated Prefixes may overlap, just that the sets may not be the same.<br><br><br>(4) How is a Node ID defined?&nbsp; What I mean is: is it a number, a string, whatever?&nbsp; It sounds like the specific definition may be left to the Flooding Mechanism, is that true?&nbsp; If so, then I think it would be a good idea to call it out — this also means that as an operator I may have to redefine my Node ID assignment mechanism if I decide to change the Flooding Mechanism.&nbsp; The ordering of the Node IDs will also depend on how they are defined.<br><br>BTW, “Node ID assignment mechanism” is mentioned in the Security Considerations, but not defined anywhere.&nbsp; It may of course not be an in-the-network mechanism and simply a manual assignment of IDs — it would be nice to say something about what it is (or may be).<br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>(A) Consistency in naming.&nbsp; <br><br>For example: “Available prefix” is defined, but later “available prefix” is used (I think) to refer to the same thing.&nbsp; Given that common words are used (Available, Valid, etc.) it is important to differentiate when the specific term is used vs just the generic use of the word.<br><br>Precedence is defined in Section 2.1, but later not used in Section 4.&nbsp; That is ok (except for the text in Section 4 that calls it out) given that it looks like the term is used when defining Best Assignment and Valid — I say it "looks like it" because “precedence” (not “Precedence”) is used.&nbsp; Should it be “Precedence”?<br><br>Valid (capital V) is also defined but not used later.&nbsp; There are a couple of places where maybe “Valid” should replace “valid”.<br><br><br>(B) Section 2. (Terminology)&nbsp; In the definition of “Private Link”, I think the “MAY” should really be “may”.&nbsp; There’s nothing normative about the example.<br><br><br>(C) s/received from the Flooding Mechanism/received through the Flooding Mechanism</div></td>

In the case of a Media Type <br>&nbsp; review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>Open source implementation: <a href="http://github.com/sbyx/hnetd">http://github.com/sbyx/hnetd</a>, <br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>Mark Townsley, Terry Manderson<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>Mark Townsley reviewed this document. The document is ready for advancement. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>Since the split from OSPF, the document was used for implementation and received at least four in-depth reviews (Jiazi Ji, Markus Stenberg, Steven Barth, Benjamin Patterson, etc…)<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>There are no “bits on the wire” aspects defined in this document for review. However, algorithm correctness is very important. In addition to implementation and testing, correctness was determined as part of an academic paper and formal proof by Benjamin Paterson in 2012 (available upon request, albeit not yet formally published outside of the university system where it was submitted).<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No specific concerns. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Email has been sent (April 17, 2015) to all authors from chairs asking for formal yes/no for this question. <br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No IPR disclosures have been filed that reference this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>Whilst the subject material is not necessarily understood in detail by a large proportion of the WG participants, there is a substantive core that has reviewed this document without dissent.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No, not that we are aware of.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>Yes, there is one warning in the current version that MAY need to be addressed:<br><br>&nbsp; == The document seems to lack the recommended <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> boilerplate, even if<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  it appears to use <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> keywords. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  (The document does seem to have the reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> which the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ID-Checklist requires).<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>Only normative reference is BCP so, no.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>No IANA actions required.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>None<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br><br><br></div></td>
