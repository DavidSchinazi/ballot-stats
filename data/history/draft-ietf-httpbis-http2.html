If I get a frame with the wrong type for my current state that is *also* a bogus size, is there a requirement that I do PROTOCOL_ERROR, or FRAME_SIZE_ERROR, or is the choice of error code not really a requirement at all? I suspect that the "MUST be treated as a connection error" is the key and *not* the particular error code. I would re-word to simply say, "The FRAME_SIZE_ERROR error is sent when a frame exceeds..." in 4.2. In 5.1 and elsewhere, you could say something like:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Receiving any frames other than [blah blah blah]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on a stream in this state MUST be treated as a connection error<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Section 5.4.1). Error type PROTOCOL_ERROR can be used for this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; condition.<br><br>I just think we'll regret when the protocol police come around saying, "But it said you MUST use such-and-so error code, and he didn't, so it's fine if my implementation does X", where X is a thoroughly idiotic thing.<br><br>4.3:<br><br>Earlier in the section, you say:<br><br>&nbsp;  A complete header block consists of either:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; a single HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frame, with the END_HEADERS flag<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set, or<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; a HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frame with the END_HEADERS flag cleared<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and one or more CONTINUATION frames, where the last CONTINUATION<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frame has the END_HEADERS flag set.<br><br>So you've defined that the last frame (or the only frame if there's no continuation) has the END_HEADERS set. Cool. But then later you make a point to say:<br><br>&nbsp;  The last frame in<br>&nbsp;  a sequence of HEADERS or CONTINUATION frames MUST have the<br>&nbsp;  END_HEADERS flag set.&nbsp; The last frame in a sequence of PUSH_PROMISE<br>&nbsp;  or CONTINUATION frames MUST have the END_HEADERS flag set.<br><br>I don't get the MUSTs. What is the situation that I need to look out for here? Is there a circumstance where an implementation might think it's OK to send the last frame without END_HEADERS set? Seems to me those two sentences can be deleted, but maybe I'm missing something.<br><br>Also unnecessarily MUSTy:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  An<br>&nbsp;  endpoint receiving HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE or CONTINUATION frames MUST<br>&nbsp;  reassemble header blocks and perform decompression even if the frames<br>&nbsp;  are to be discarded.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  Hence, an endpoint receiving HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE or CONTINUATION<br>&nbsp;  frames needs to reassemble header blocks and perform decompression<br>&nbsp;  even if the frames are to be discarded.<br>END<br><br>5.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  open:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [...]<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From this state either endpoint can send a frame with an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; END_STREAM flag set, which causes the stream to transition into<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one of the "half closed" states: [...].<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Either endpoint can send a RST_STREAM frame from this state,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; causing it to transition immediately to "closed".<br><br>You should probably define the silly state of a RST_STREAM frame with and END_STREAM flag set on it. I presume that you immediately go to "closed", but if you implemented it in a goofy way, you may end up in "half closed".<br><br>A clarifying bit:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  half closed (local):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A stream that is in the "half closed (local)" state cannot be used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for sending frames.&nbsp; Only WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY and RST_STREAM<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; frames can be sent in this state.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  half closed (local):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A stream that is in the "half closed (local)" state cannot be used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for sending frames other than WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RST_STREAM.<br>END<br><br>Also:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If an endpoint receives additional frames for a stream that is in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this state, other than WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY or RST_STREAM, it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST respond with a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STREAM_CLOSED.<br><br>I think it would be good to introduce some language somewhere, maybe here (and in other places throughout section 6 referring to stream errors) or maybe in 5.4, that says that you MUST respond with a stream error *unless the frame in question would also constitute a connection error, in which case you MUST respond with a connection error*.<br><br>5.4.3: I'm not clear on how to implement a "MUST assume". What is it that the implementation MUST do?<br><br>8.2.2: I was actually a little surprised to see the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS suggestion. I would have thought that using window size would be much more obvious. Any reason you chose to discuss one instead of the other?<br><br>11.3: No advice or criteria to use for the expert reviewer?</div></td>

Barry Leiba is the responsible Area Director.<br><br>This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent messages on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.<br><br>This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.<br><br>We intend this to be published as a Proposed Standard.<br><br><br># Review and Consensus<br><br>We have enjoyed active participation from a broad community, including browser vendors, intermediaries (such as CDN and proxy vendors), server vendors and protocol library authors; this includes both commercial vendors and open source libraries.<br><br>Our current implementation list is at:<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations">https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations</a><br>&nbsp; <br>Additionally, we have had participation and review from the non-implementing HTTP community itself. We have substantial external interest from the Web performance community as well.<br><br>We have also coordinated with the W3C, giving them regular updates through the liaison and the TAG.<br><br>Process-wise, we were chartered to do this work in August 2012, with a submission deadline of November 2014. We have treated that date seriously, so as to bound the commitment of the developers and implementers involved. As a result, we had a fairly high frequency of interim meetings (six in two years), used both to discuss issues and to hold interop events.<br><br>Perhaps inevitably, there have been a number of contentious issues in the development of HTTP/2. The most notable is listed below; a full listing of design issues can be found at:<br>&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign">https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign</a><br><br>## Requiring Encryption<br><br><br><br><br>HTTP/2 used SPDY as a starting point, and SPDY was only ever implemented over TLS for HTTPS URLs. <br><br>There were many in the Working Group who felt that this constraint should be explicit in the new protocol. They were motivated not only by the Snowden revelations, but also other common (and currently passive) attacks upon HTTP, such as "FireSheep" coffee shop sniffing and the Google "drive-by wifi" sniffing attacks.<br><br>Implementing the protocol over TLS also improves interoperability, since middleboxes aren't generally able to manipulate the plaintext -- a perennial problem for HTTP evolution and conformance.<br><br>The Working Group had a wide-ranging discussion about this topic, mostly during and between the August 2013 (Berlin) and January 2014 (Zurich) meetings.<br><br>We considered requiring the use of TLS (through https:// URIs) for HTTP/2. However, some members of the community pushed back against this, on the grounds that it would be too onerous for some uses of HTTP (not necessarily CPU; cost and administration of certificates was cited as a burden, as was the follow-on disruption to applications, since transitioning from HTTP to HTTPS often requires non-trivial content changes, due to the way that the browser security model works).<br><br>As a result, we decided to document the use of HTTP/2 for both https:// and http:// URLs, the latter in cleartext (the "h2c" protocol ID), leaving it up to implementations to decide what they support.<br><br>The WG also discussed an "Opportunistic Security" approach to using TLS for http:// URIs (but without authentication). This was a bit controversial too, as some community members felt that having another, weaker kind of security defined harms the long-term deployment of "full" TLS.<br><br>After discussion in June 2014 (New York) we agreed to adopt this document as an optional extension, but only with Experimental status: .
