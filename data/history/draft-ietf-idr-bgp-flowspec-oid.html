thank you to him for spotting<br>them, and to the authors for pulling in the fixes.<br><br>It seems to me that the revision to the validation procedures that we<br>describe here may be broader than needed to satisfy the stated use case,<br>and that such broadness has a corresponding weakening of the security<br>properties of the system as a whole.&nbsp; My understanding is that when<br>central controllers or route-reflectors are used, they tend to be in<br>some sense "more trusted" than peer routers in the domain (and,<br>correspondingly, more tightly secured).&nbsp; So it seems like the system as<br>a whole would be less fragile/more secure if "off-path" flow specs were<br>allowed only from the trusted source, versus from any peer in the same<br>AS [confederation].&nbsp; Is there a reason why such a procedure is<br>infeasible?&nbsp; (It seems like all peers in the AS could be marked as<br>"trusted" in this way, if appropriate, which allows for recovering the<br>current semantics of this draft if needed.)&nbsp; This is, in essence, the<br>same topic raised by the secdir reviewer and relates to "fail-closed" vs<br>"fail-open".&nbsp; I think it gives a clearer picture on what the safe and<br>recommended behavior is, if we say to only accept these routes from<br>"trusted peers in the local domain" (but allow all peers in the local<br>domain to be trusted if appropriate) than to say to always accept these<br>routes from peers in the local domain and optionally do strict<br>enforcement if we know that the peer advertising the route is not a<br>route server.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes a modification to the validation procedure<br>&nbsp;  defined for the dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications requires that the originator<br>&nbsp;  of the Flow Specification matches the originator of the best-match<br>&nbsp;  unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in the Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'd suggest adding a couple words about "prior to this document<br>requires" or "as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8955/">RFC 8955</a> requires", since that's exactly<br>what we're changing with this document.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the validation procedure will fail in this<br>&nbsp;  scenario.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Similarly, this could also say "the <a href="/doc/rfc8955/">RFC 8955</a> validation procedure".<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The AS_PATH attribute of the Flow Specification is empty or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contains only an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment [<a href="/doc/rfc5065/">RFC5065</a>].<br><br>Would there ever be cause to have a knob that allows this condition only<br>for the empty AS_PATH (and denies this condition when AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE<br>is present)?&nbsp; From skimming <a href="/doc/rfc5065/">RFC 5065</a> I mostly assume not, but have to<br>ask...<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For clarity, the AS in the left-most position of the AS_PATH means<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the AS that was last added to the AS_SEQUENCE.<br><br>Thank you for including this; it is a big help for readability.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Using the new rule to validate a Flow Specification route received<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from an External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) peer belonging to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same local domain (in the case of a confederation) is out of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the scope of this document.&nbsp; Note that although it's possible, its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; utility is dubious.&nbsp; Although it is conceivable that a router in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the same local domain (both iBGP and eBGP within the same local<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; domain) could send a rogue update, only eBGP (outside the local<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; domain) risk is considered within this document (in the same<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spirit of the mentioned beforehand AS_PATH validation in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC4271</a>]).<br><br>I'm having (I think) the same trouble John did reading this paragraph.<br>I'll watch his ballot thread and chime in there if needed; no need to<br>specifically reply here.<br><br>Section 7<br><br>We could mention again (per §3) that having this mechanism allows<br>central SOC or controller systems to be able to propagate flowspecs more<br>readily during attacks and improves the stability/security of the<br>network.<br><br>&nbsp;  This document updates the route feasibility validation procedures for<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specifications learned from iBGP peers and through route<br>&nbsp;  servers.&nbsp; This change is in line with the procedures described in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8955/">RFC8955</a>] and, thus, the security characteristics equivalent to the<br>&nbsp;  existing security properties of BGP unicast routing are maintained.<br><br>I would argue that the security characteristics are not (strictly)<br>"equivalent", but only "roughly equivalent".&nbsp; With the new procedures, a<br>malicious or compromised node in the local AS can (e.g.) cause traffic<br>to be discarded without steering that traffic to/through itself.&nbsp; There<br>are plenty of other ways that such a malicious node can cause harm, not<br>least announcing that prefix and dropping the traffic as it passes<br>through, so the overall properties of the system are roughly equivalent,<br>but there are clear differences of the particulars.<br><br>&nbsp;  route servers may suppose an operational challenge.&nbsp; If the condition<br>&nbsp;  of the peer is unknown, the rule SHOULD not be enforced.<br><br>In light of my top-level comment (and the secdir review), I'm<br>uncomfortable with a SHOULD-level "fail-open" behavior.&nbsp; Could the<br>default behavior when the condition of the peer is unkonwn be subject to<br>a configuration knob?<br><br>&nbsp;  BGP updates learned from iBGP peers are considered trusted, so the<br>&nbsp;  Traffic Flow Specifications contained in BGP updates are also<br>&nbsp;  considered trusted.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not required to validate that<br>&nbsp;  the originator of an intra-domain Traffic Flow Specification matches<br>&nbsp;  the originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination<br>&nbsp;  prefix embedded in that Flow Specification.&nbsp; Note that this<br>&nbsp;  trustworthy consideration is not absolute and the new possibility<br>&nbsp;  than an iBGP speaker could send a rogue Flow Specification is<br>&nbsp;  introduced.<br><br>Also in light of my toplevel comment, it's not clear that this paragraph<br>adds much value.&nbsp; Specifically, as we note in the last sentence, the<br>level of trust in a route server is not (in the general case) the same<br>level of trust in a generic peer in the iBGP domain, even if both peers<br>are trusted in a general sense.&nbsp; So it seems that the core sentiment<br>here is that when we get the flowspec from a trusted source, it's<br>trusted, and we don't need to be as strict about validating that it's<br>the same source that we would send the traffic to in the absence of a<br>flowspec.<br><br>Section 9.1<br><br>It seems that <a href="/doc/rfc7947/">RFC 7947</a> is reference in only one location, and not in a<br>manner that strongly implies a normative relationship.<br><br>NITS<br><br>Abstract<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For an iBGP received route, the originator is<br><br>"IBGP" (with that capitalization) appears on the RFC Editor's list<br>at <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt">https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt</a> but is not<br>marked as "well-known".&nbsp; So we should probably use the expanded version<br>in the abstract and define it on first use in the body.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>&nbsp;  the same forwarding path as the dest-route.&nbsp; For the case where AS1<br>&nbsp;  has thousands of ASBRs, it becomes impractical to originate different<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specification rules on each ASBR in AS1 based on which ASBR each<br>&nbsp;  dest-route is learned from.&nbsp; The objective is to advertise all the<br>&nbsp;  Flow Specifications from the same route-controller.<br><br>"it becomes impractical" does not flow directly to "the objective is";<br>I'd put some transition phrase in, like "to make the situation more<br>tenable".<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  can direct border routers within their AS with specific attack<br>&nbsp;  mitigation actions (drop the traffic, forward to a clean-pipe center,<br>&nbsp;  etc.).<br><br>Maybe "clean-pipe center" is a term of art I'm not familiar with, but<br>the natural reading would be that a clean pipe is something that is the<br>output of a scrubbing center, and that pipe-cleaning is the operation<br>performed there.&nbsp; This would suggest rewording to something like<br>"forward to a scrubbing center", "forward to a pipe-cleaning location",<br>etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition, an operator may extend the requirements above for a<br>&nbsp;  group of ASes via policy.&nbsp; This is described in section (b.2.3) of<br>&nbsp;  the validation procedure.<br><br>I suggest a forward reference ("below" or "in Section 4.1") to contrast<br>to the <a href="/doc/rfc8955/">RFC 8955</a> procedure.<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the latter applies, a network should be designed so<br>&nbsp;  it has a congruent topology amongst unicast routes and Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification routes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This "should" does not give any indication of why the network should be<br>designed in this manner (e.g., that failing to do so would result in<br>(b.1) failing).<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flow Specifications originated in a different local domain sill<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; need a congruent topology.&nbsp; The reason is that the second<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; condition (b.2) evaluates to false and only the first condition<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b.1) is evaluated.<br><br>I suggest s/different local domain/different domain/ -- my first reading<br>of "different local domain" was "a different AS but the same<br>confederation", and only by contrasting this statement to the previous<br>paragraph did I realize the intended meaning.<br>Alternately (or additionally?), this could be clarified by noting that<br>this scenario will result in an AS_PATH that contains<br>non-AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segments.</div></td>

You’re relaxing the rule in <a href="/doc/rfc8955/">RFC 8955</a>, but as you point out in section 4.2, <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC 4271</a> makes AS_PATH neighbor AS insertion enforcement optional to begin with:<br><br>&nbsp;  If the UPDATE message is received from an external peer, the local<br>&nbsp;  system MAY check whether the leftmost (with respect to the position<br>&nbsp;  of octets in the protocol message) AS in the AS_PATH attribute is<br>&nbsp;  equal to the autonomous system number of the peer that sent the<br>&nbsp;  message.&nbsp; If the check determines this is not the case, the Error<br>&nbsp;  Subcode MUST be set to Malformed AS_PATH.<br><br>Maybe you could rewrite something like this: “As per section 4.2, it is becomes optional to enforce that the AS_PATH attribute of a route received via the External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) contains the neighboring AS in the leftmost position of the AS_PATH attribute. Then we continue:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If that original rule is actually not<br>&nbsp;  enforced it may introduce some security risks.&nbsp; A peer (or a client<br>&nbsp;  of a route server peer) in AS X could advertise a rogue Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification route whose first AS in AS_PATH was Y (assume Y is the<br>&nbsp;  first AS in the AS_PATH of the best-match unicast route).&nbsp; This risk<br>&nbsp;  is impossible to prevent if the Flow Specification route is received<br>&nbsp;  from a route server peer.&nbsp; <br><br>I think you’ve missed out on the opportunity to point out that the risk can also be mitigated if the route server itself enforces the optional rule of <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC 4271</a> section 6.3.. I think it’s fair to say that at an exchange point, the administrator of the route server enjoys more trust then the administrators of other routers at the exchange point.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If that peer is known for a fact not to be<br>&nbsp;  a route server, that optional rule SHOULD be enforced for Flow<br>&nbsp;  Specification routes.<br><br>It may be necessary to say a little more about how you would get this knowledge about the peer not being a route server. Possibly a rewrite could be something like: "Unless configuration (or other means beyond the scope of this document) indicates that the peer is a route server, that optional rule SHOULD be enforced for Flow Specification routes from EBGP peers."<br><br><br>11.

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA considerations are necessary. <br>The change is within the protocol and does not require registration. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br>No IANA considerations are necessary. <br>The change is within the protocol and does not require registration. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.

If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>No Yang modules. <br><br>This draft will require draft which augmentation of the base BGP model - after that BGP model is approved. <br><br></div></td>
