It represents an approach developed by a design<br>&nbsp;  team coordinated by Radia Perlman.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent?<br><br>&nbsp;  No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the<br>Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this<br>check needs to be thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  No nits although the nits checker warns about a possible bad<br>&nbsp;  example IPv4 address: "4.6.1.2". This is actually a Section number<br>&nbsp;  from <a href="/doc/rfc6325/">RFC 6325</a>.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No formal review required.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready<br>for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such<br>normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  There is a normative reference to <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-trill-rfc7180bis/">draft-ietf-trill-rfc7180bis</a> for<br>&nbsp;  which RFC publication has been requested.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no downward normative references.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction?<br><br>&nbsp;  This document does not change the status of any exising RFC.<br>&nbsp;  <br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The IANA Considerations were carefully compared with the text. It<br>&nbsp;  requests appropriate assignments from exising registries and<br>&nbsp;  creates onw new registry for Extended RBridge Capability bits. The<br>&nbsp;  initial contents is well specified along with allocation procedure<br>&nbsp;  and name. This new registry is Expert Review and experts with a<br>&nbsp;  strong background in TRILL should be appointed.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  Thid document creates an "Extended RBridge Capapbilities Registry"<br>&nbsp;  with assignment by Expert Review. Strong TRILL technical experts<br>&nbsp;  should be selected for the IANA Experts.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews required.<br></div></td>
