That's true at present, of course, but I would still<br>like to see a little discussion of how it might coexist with other SRTP<br>extensions that place content as a trailer (both would need to be<br>parseable from the tail of the content and have a length field; and they<br>woule either need to share a message-type namespace or have a profile<br>specification to indicate what order they appear in), though the<br>discussion that already occurred suffices to make this not a<br>Discuss-level point.<br><br>Section 5 has:<br><br>&nbsp; the DTLS-SRTP peer in the server role to the client.&nbsp; This allows<br>&nbsp; those peers to process EKT keying material in SRTP (or SRTCP) and<br>&nbsp; retrieve the embedded SRTP keying material.&nbsp; This combination of<br><br>but in Section 4 we say that "use with SRTCP would be similar, but is<br>reserved for a future specification".&nbsp; (There may be one or two other<br>places that have text placing SRTCP on the same footing as SRTP even<br>though they are not, at present.)<br><br>Also section 5<br><br>&nbsp; In cases where the DTLS termination point is more trusted than the<br>&nbsp; media relay, the protection that DTLS affords to EKT key material can<br>&nbsp; allow EKT keys to be tunneled through an untrusted relay such as a<br>&nbsp; centralized conference bridge.&nbsp; For more details, see<br>&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-perc-private-media-framework/">I-D.ietf-perc-private-media-framework</a>].<br><br>I did not chase the reference, but it seems like this sentence might<br>apply equally for "EKT keys to be tunneled" and "SRTP master keys to be<br>tunneled".&nbsp;

EKT MAY be used with versions of DTLS prior to 1.3.&nbsp; In such cases,<br>&nbsp; the Ack message is still used to provide reliability.&nbsp; Thus, DTLS<br>&nbsp; implementations supporting EKT with DTLS pre-1.3 will need to have<br>&nbsp; explicit affordances for sending the Ack message in response to an<br>&nbsp; EKTKey message, and for verifying that an Ack message was received.<br>&nbsp; The retransmission rules for both sides are the same as in DTLS 1.3.<br><br>...but here we say that the DTLS 1.3 retransmission rules are<br>authoritative.&nbsp;

In some systems, when a member of a conference leaves the<br>&nbsp; conferences, the conferences is rekeyed so that member no longer has<br>&nbsp; the key.&nbsp; When changing to a new EKTKey, it is possible that the<br>&nbsp; attacker could block the EKTKey message getting to a particular<br>&nbsp; endpoint and that endpoint would keep sending media encrypted using<br>&nbsp; the old key.&nbsp; To mitigate that risk, the lifetime of the EKTKey MUST<br>&nbsp; be limited using the ekt_ttl.<br><br>Do we want to give any concrete guidance about ekt_ttl values?</div></td>

While no single comment rises to the level of<br>a DISCUSS-worthy issue, several of these are moderately severe. I would<br>appreciate either a response to each comment, or a corresponding<br>change in the document.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Thanks to the work that everyone has put in on getting an EKT mechanism<br>specified and finalized. I have a handful of comments that I would like to see<br>considered prior to publication of the document.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; EKT provides a way for an SRTP session participant, to securely<br>&gt;&nbsp; transport its SRTP master key and current SRTP rollover counter to<br>&gt;&nbsp; the other participants in the session.<br><br>Nit: "...participant to securely..."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  EKTMsgTypeExtension = %x03-FF<br><br>Shouldn't this be "%x01 / %x03-ff" ?<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  SRTPMasterKeyLength = BYTE<br>&gt;&nbsp;  SRTPMasterKey = 1*256BYTE<br><br>I think this either needs to be "1*255BYTE", or we need text that explicitly<br>indicates that an SRTPMasterKeyLength value of 0x00 means "256 bytes." Probably<br>the former.<br><br>I think this is even further constrained by the fact that EKTCiphertext is<br>limited to 256 bytes, and contains the SRTPMasterKeyLength, SRTPMasterKey,<br>SSRC, and ROC (and is not compressed) -- which means the SRTPMasterKeyLength<br>can't be more than (256 - 1 - 4 - 4 =) 247 bytes. So perhaps "1*247BYTE" is<br>more appropriate?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; The creation of the EKTField MUST precede the normal SRTP<br>&gt;&nbsp; packet processing.<br><br>Why? This seems unnecessary and unnecessarily complicated. If the order of<br>operations has an impact on the bits on the wire (I don't see how it does?),<br>then please include some explanatory text here that clarifies the reason for<br>this constraint.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; When a packet is sent with the ShortEKTField, the ShortEKFField is<br>&gt;&nbsp; simply appended to the packet.<br><br>Nit: s/ShortEKFField/ShortEKTField/<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; If the SSRC in the EKTPlaintext does not match the SSRC of the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SRTP packet received, then all the information from this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EKTPlaintext MUST be discarded and the following steps in this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list are skipped.<br><br>I can see implementors easily interpreting this as requiring them to discard<br>the RTP payload as well. If that's not the intention (I don't think it is),<br>consider adding text like "The FullEKTField is removed from the packet then<br>normal SRTP or SRTCP processing occurs."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.3:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Section 4.2.1 recommends that SRTP senders continue using an old key<br>&gt;&nbsp; for some time after sending a new key in an EKT tag.<br><br>This is the first appearance of the phrase "EKT tag," which never seems to be<br>properly defined. I presume this is meant to be the combination of the EKT<br>Ciphertext and the SPI?<br><br>In any case, please clearly define this term somewhere, preferably before using<br>it the first time.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.3:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; cannot be used and they also need to create a counter that keeps<br>&gt;&nbsp; track of how many times the key has been used to encrypt data to<br>&gt;&nbsp; ensure it does not exceed the T value for that cipher (see ).<br><br>The parenthetical phrase appears to be missing something here.<br><br><br>&gt;&nbsp; If<br>&gt;&nbsp; either of these limits are exceeded, the key can no longer be used<br><br>Nit: "...either... is exceeded..."<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; for encryption.&nbsp; At this point implementation need to either use the<br><br>Nit: "...implementations need..."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.5:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; If a source has its EKTKey changed by the key management, it MUST<br>&gt;&nbsp; also change its SRTP master key<br><br>I suppose it's not terribly important for interop, but the implication that this<br>change takes place immediately seems to contradict the 250 ms period specified<br>in §4.2.1. Perhaps a few words here about how these two normative statements<br>are intended to interact would save implementors a bit of grief.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.6:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; This document defines the use of EKT with SRTP.&nbsp; Its use with SRTCP<br>&gt;&nbsp; would be similar, but is reserved for a future specification.<br><br>After reading this far, I was quite surprised to find this qualification. If<br>this is the intention for this document, please adjust the rest of the text to<br>match. Some examples follow.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; The following shows the syntax of the EKTField expressed in ABNF<br>&gt;&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5234/">RFC5234</a>].&nbsp; The EKTField is added to the end of an SRTP or SRTCP<br>&gt;&nbsp; packet.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; Rollover Counter (ROC): On the sender side, this is set to the<br>&gt;&nbsp; current value of the SRTP rollover counter in the SRTP/SRTCP context<br>&gt;&nbsp; associated with the SSRC in the SRTP or SRTCP packet.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The final byte is checked to determine which EKT format is in<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use.&nbsp; When an SRTP or SRTCP packet contains a ShortEKTField, the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ShortEKTField is removed from the packet then normal SRTP or<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SRTCP processing occurs.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using the last byte of the packet to indicate the type is that<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the length of the SRTP or SRTCP part is not known until the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; decryption has occurred.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; At this point, EKT processing has successfully completed, and the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; normal SRTP or SRTCP processing takes place.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; This allows<br>&gt;&nbsp; those peers to process EKT keying material in SRTP (or SRTCP) and<br>&gt;&nbsp; retrieve the embedded SRTP keying material.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  To accommodate packet loss, it is<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  RECOMMENDED that three consecutive packets contain the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  FullEKTField be transmitted.<br><br>Nit: "...containing..." (alternately, remove "be transmitted" -- both make a<br>grammatically correct sentance)<br><br>More substantially -- under "New sender:", I'm a little surprised that there<br>isn't any mention of other senders re-keying in response to a new sender<br>joining. In the vast majority of conferences, when a sender joins, that same<br>entity generally will also be a receiver. It seems this should trigger other<br>senders to include the key in their next packet.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Rekey:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  By sending EKT tag over SRTP, the rekeying event shares fate with<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  the SRTP packets protected with that new SRTP master key.<br><br>Is this actually true? Going back to the 250 ms period specified in §4.2.1, it<br>seems that the master key is sent out in packets pretty far removed from those<br>it actually protects.<br><br>Between this and the inconsistency I mention in §4.5 above, this increasingly<br>feels like maybe there were two different ways of reasoning about the timing<br>of sending a master key versus the timing of actually using it. Does the text<br>in §4.2.1 perhaps represent an outdated notion of how this is intended to<br>work?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  If sending audio and video, the RECOMMENDED<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  frequency is the same as the rate of intra coded video frames.&nbsp; If<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  only sending audio, the RECOMMENDED frequency is every 100ms.<br><br>Is this "100ms" correct?&nbsp; Assuming, say, the use of Opus at voice quality with<br>20 ms packets, this is taking packets on the order of 40 bytes in length and<br>tacking on something like 20 to 30 bytes to every fifth packet. That's an<br>increase in overall stream size on the order of roughly 15% to 20%.<br><br>At the same time, when using real-time video, intra frames are going to happen<br>roughly every 500 ms to 1500 ms. If a cadence on that order is okay for<br>audiovisual streams, I have to imagine it's okay for audio streams.<br><br>So, to clarify: is this "100ms" a typo for "1000 ms"?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§7.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Name&nbsp; &nbsp;  | Value | Specification |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | AESKW128 |&nbsp; &nbsp;  1 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | AESKW256 |&nbsp; &nbsp;  2 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Reserved |&nbsp;  255 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table 3: EKT Cipher Types<br><br>Section 5.2.1 reserves "0" as well.

However, the key extracted from the FullEKTField ,<br>&nbsp;  when used to decrypt the SRTP payload, would be wrong and the SRTP<br>&nbsp;  integrity check would fail.&nbsp; Note that the FullEKTField only changes<br>&nbsp;  the decryption key and does not change the encryption key.&nbsp; None of<br>&nbsp;  these are considered significant attacks as any attacker that can<br>&nbsp;  modify the packets in transit and cause the integrity check to fail.<br><br>I think this last sentence went a bit funky; presumably it's "any attacker<br>that can modify the packets in transit can already cause the SRTP integrity<br>check to fail even in the absence of EKT".<br><br>&nbsp;  An attacker could send packets containing a FullEKTField, in an<br>&nbsp;  attempt to consume additional CPU resources of the receiving system<br>&nbsp;  by causing the receiving system to decrypt the EKT ciphertext and<br>&nbsp;  detect an authentication failure.&nbsp; In some cases, caching the<br>&nbsp;  previous values of the Ciphertext as described in Section 4.3 helps<br>&nbsp;  mitigate this issue.<br><br>I'm not really sure what cases those are supposed to be, since an attacker<br>can send arbitrary junk and tweak it by a bit each time, and the recipient<br>has to do the full decryption to validate the integrity IV.<br><br>&nbsp;  In a similar vein, EKT has no replay protection, so an attacker could<br>&nbsp;  implant improper keys in receivers by capturing EKTCiphertext values<br>&nbsp;  encrypted with a given EKTKey and replaying them in a different<br>&nbsp;  context, e.g., from a different sender.&nbsp; When the underlying SRTP<br><br>Wouldn't the SSRC check block this particular replay?<br><br>&nbsp;  transform provides integrity protection, this attack will just result<br>&nbsp;  in packet loss.&nbsp; If it does not, then it will result in random data<br>&nbsp;  being fed to RTP payload processing.&nbsp; An attacker that is in a<br>&nbsp;  position to mount these attacks, however, could achieve the same<br>&nbsp;  effects more easily without attacking EKT.<br><br>maybe add "by directly modifying the SRTP packet contents"?<br><br>&nbsp;  The confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the EKT cipher<br>&nbsp;  MUST be at least as strong as the SRTP cipher and at least as strong<br>&nbsp;  as the DTLS-SRTP ciphers.<br><br>EKT doesn't carry anything that's an input to DTLS, so shouldn't this<br>restriction be that the DTLS cipher must be as stront as the EKT one?<br><br>Section 7.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 track of how many times the key has been used to encrypt data to<br>&nbsp;  ensure it does not exceed the T value for that cipher (see ).&nbsp; If<br><br>Since we knowingly create EKTCiphertexts that are identical, do we count<br>those as a single encryption or do we count each time we send them?<br>(I guess Section 4.4 mostly answers this by way of example but a<br>non-example statement is probably in order.)<br><br>&nbsp;

 With EKT, each SRTP sender and receiver MUST generate distinct SRTP<br>&nbsp;  master keys.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Er, isn't this just senders?<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that the inputs of EKT are the same as for SRTP with key-<br><br>"inputs" in terms of shared cryptographic material that is fed into the<br>SRTP (plus EKT) protocol collection?<br><br>&nbsp;  sharing: a single key is provided to protect an entire SRTP session.<br>&nbsp;  However, EKT remains secure even when SSRC values collide.<br><br>I think you need to say more about what "secure" is supposed to mean, here.<br><br>&nbsp;  The presence of the SSRC in the EKTPlaintext ensures that an attacker<br>&nbsp;  cannot substitute an EKTCiphertext from one SRTP stream into another<br>&nbsp;  SRTP stream.<br><br>Depends on the attacker; if one of the call participants has the network<br>positioning to do so, their knowledge of the EKT allows for generating an<br>EKTCiphertext that matches the SSRC of an arbitrary message.&nbsp; (I guess<br>technically that involves modifying and not straight substitution of the<br>EKTCiphertext.)<br><br>&nbsp;  An attacker who tampers with the bits in FullEKTField can prevent the<br>&nbsp;  intended receiver of that packet from being able to decrypt it.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  is a minor denial of service vulnerability.&nbsp; Similarly the attacker<br>&nbsp;  could take an old FullEKTField from the same session and attach it to<br>&nbsp;  the packet.&nbsp; The FullEKTField would correctly decode and pass<br>&nbsp;  integrity checks.&nbsp; However, the key extracted from the FullEKTField ,<br>&nbsp;  when used to decrypt the SRTP payload, would be wrong and the SRTP<br>&nbsp;  integrity check would fail.&nbsp; Note that the FullEKTField only changes<br>&nbsp;  the decryption key and does not change the encryption key.&nbsp; None of<br>&nbsp;  these are considered significant attacks as any attacker that can<br>&nbsp;  modify the packets in transit and cause the integrity check to fail.<br><br>I think this last sentence went a bit funky; presumably it's "any attacker<br>that can modify the packets in transit can already cause the SRTP integrity<br>check to fail even in the absence of EKT".<br><br>&nbsp;  An attacker could send packets containing a FullEKTField, in an<br>&nbsp;  attempt to consume additional CPU resources of the receiving system<br>&nbsp;  by causing the receiving system to decrypt the EKT ciphertext and<br>&nbsp;  detect an authentication failure.&nbsp; In some cases, caching the<br>&nbsp;  previous values of the Ciphertext as described in Section 4.3 helps<br>&nbsp;  mitigate this issue.<br><br>I'm not really sure what cases those are supposed to be, since an attacker<br>can send arbitrary junk and tweak it by a bit each time, and the recipient<br>has to do the full decryption to validate the integrity IV.<br><br>&nbsp;  In a similar vein, EKT has no replay protection, so an attacker could<br>&nbsp;  implant improper keys in receivers by capturing EKTCiphertext values<br>&nbsp;  encrypted with a given EKTKey and replaying them in a different<br>&nbsp;  context, e.g., from a different sender.&nbsp; When the underlying SRTP<br><br>Wouldn't the SSRC check block this particular replay?<br><br>&nbsp;  transform provides integrity protection, this attack will just result<br>&nbsp;  in packet loss.&nbsp; If it does not, then it will result in random data<br>&nbsp;  being fed to RTP payload processing.&nbsp; An attacker that is in a<br>&nbsp;  position to mount these attacks, however, could achieve the same<br>&nbsp;  effects more easily without attacking EKT.<br><br>maybe add "by directly modifying the SRTP packet contents"?<br><br>&nbsp;  The confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of the EKT cipher<br>&nbsp;

I have a handful of comments that I would like to see<br>considered prior to publication of the document.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; EKT provides a way for an SRTP session participant, to securely<br>&gt;&nbsp; transport its SRTP master key and current SRTP rollover counter to<br>&gt;&nbsp; the other participants in the session.<br><br>Nit: "...participant to securely..."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  EKTMsgTypeExtension = %x03-FF<br><br>Shouldn't this be "%x01 / %x03-ff" ?<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;  SRTPMasterKeyLength = BYTE<br>&gt;&nbsp;  SRTPMasterKey = 1*256BYTE<br><br>I think this either needs to be "1*255BYTE", or we need text that explicitly<br>indicates that an SRTPMasterKeyLength value of 0x00 means "256 bytes." Probably<br>the former.<br><br>I think this is even further constrained by the fact that EKTCiphertext is<br>limited to 256 bytes, and contains the SRTPMasterKeyLength, SRTPMasterKey,<br>SSRC, and ROC (and is not compressed) -- which means the SRTPMasterKeyLength<br>can't be more than (256 - 1 - 4 - 4 =) 247 bytes. So perhaps "1*247BYTE" is<br>more appropriate?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; The creation of the EKTField MUST precede the normal SRTP<br>&gt;&nbsp; packet processing.<br><br>Why? This seems unnecessary and unnecessarily complicated. If the order of<br>operations has an impact on the bits on the wire (I don't see how it does?),<br>then please include some explanatory text here that clarifies the reason for<br>this constraint.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; When a packet is sent with the ShortEKTField, the ShortEKFField is<br>&gt;&nbsp; simply appended to the packet.<br><br>Nit: s/ShortEKFField/ShortEKTField/<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.2.1:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; If the SSRC in the EKTPlaintext does not match the SSRC of the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SRTP packet received, then all the information from this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EKTPlaintext MUST be discarded and the following steps in this<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; list are skipped.<br><br>I can see implementors easily interpreting this as requiring them to discard<br>the RTP payload as well. If that's not the intention (I don't think it is),<br>consider adding text like "The FullEKTField is removed from the packet then<br>normal SRTP or SRTCP processing occurs."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.3:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Section 4.2.1 recommends that SRTP senders continue using an old key<br>&gt;&nbsp; for some time after sending a new key in an EKT tag.<br><br>This is the first appearance of the phrase "EKT tag," which never seems to be<br>properly defined. I presume this is meant to be the combination of the EKT<br>Ciphertext and the SPI?<br><br>In any case, please clearly define this term somewhere, preferably before using<br>it the first time.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.3:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; cannot be used and they also need to create a counter that keeps<br>&gt;&nbsp; track of how many times the key has been used to encrypt data to<br>&gt;&nbsp; ensure it does not exceed the T value for that cipher (see ).<br><br>The parenthetical phrase appears to be missing something here.<br><br><br>&gt;&nbsp; If<br>&gt;&nbsp; either of these limits are exceeded, the key can no longer be used<br><br>Nit: "...either... is exceeded..."<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; for encryption.&nbsp; At this point implementation need to either use the<br><br>Nit: "...implementations need..."<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.5:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; If a source has its EKTKey changed by the key management, it MUST<br>&gt;&nbsp; also change its SRTP master key<br><br>I suppose it's not terribly important for interop, but the implication that this<br>change takes place immediately seems to contradict the 250 ms period specified<br>in §4.2.1. Perhaps a few words here about how these two normative statements<br>are intended to interact would save implementors a bit of grief.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.6:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; This document defines the use of EKT with SRTP.&nbsp; Its use with SRTCP<br>&gt;&nbsp; would be similar, but is reserved for a future specification.<br><br>After reading this far, I was quite surprised to find this qualification. If<br>this is the intention for this document, please adjust the rest of the text to<br>match. Some examples follow.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; The following shows the syntax of the EKTField expressed in ABNF<br>&gt;&nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc5234/">RFC5234</a>].&nbsp; The EKTField is added to the end of an SRTP or SRTCP<br>&gt;&nbsp; packet.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; Rollover Counter (ROC): On the sender side, this is set to the<br>&gt;&nbsp; current value of the SRTP rollover counter in the SRTP/SRTCP context<br>&gt;&nbsp; associated with the SSRC in the SRTP or SRTCP packet.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; The final byte is checked to determine which EKT format is in<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use.&nbsp; When an SRTP or SRTCP packet contains a ShortEKTField, the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ShortEKTField is removed from the packet then normal SRTP or<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SRTCP processing occurs.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason for<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; using the last byte of the packet to indicate the type is that<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the length of the SRTP or SRTCP part is not known until the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; decryption has occurred.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; At this point, EKT processing has successfully completed, and the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; normal SRTP or SRTCP processing takes place.<br>-----<br>&gt;&nbsp; This allows<br>&gt;&nbsp; those peers to process EKT keying material in SRTP (or SRTCP) and<br>&gt;&nbsp; retrieve the embedded SRTP keying material.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  To accommodate packet loss, it is<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  RECOMMENDED that three consecutive packets contain the<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  FullEKTField be transmitted.<br><br>Nit: "...containing..." (alternately, remove "be transmitted" -- both make a<br>grammatically correct sentance)<br><br>More substantially -- under "New sender:", I'm a little surprised that there<br>isn't any mention of other senders re-keying in response to a new sender<br>joining. In the vast majority of conferences, when a sender joins, that same<br>entity generally will also be a receiver. It seems this should trigger other<br>senders to include the key in their next packet.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Rekey:<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  By sending EKT tag over SRTP, the rekeying event shares fate with<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  the SRTP packets protected with that new SRTP master key.<br><br>Is this actually true? Going back to the 250 ms period specified in §4.2.1, it<br>seems that the master key is sent out in packets pretty far removed from those<br>it actually protects.<br><br>Between this and the inconsistency I mention in §4.5 above, this increasingly<br>feels like maybe there were two different ways of reasoning about the timing<br>of sending a master key versus the timing of actually using it. Does the text<br>in §4.2.1 perhaps represent an outdated notion of how this is intended to<br>work?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§4.7:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  If sending audio and video, the RECOMMENDED<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  frequency is the same as the rate of intra coded video frames.&nbsp; If<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;  only sending audio, the RECOMMENDED frequency is every 100ms.<br><br>Is this "100ms" correct?&nbsp; Assuming, say, the use of Opus at voice quality with<br>20 ms packets, this is taking packets on the order of 40 bytes in length and<br>tacking on something like 20 to 30 bytes to every fifth packet. That's an<br>increase in overall stream size on the order of roughly 15% to 20%.<br><br>At the same time, when using real-time video, intra frames are going to happen<br>roughly every 500 ms to 1500 ms. If a cadence on that order is okay for<br>audiovisual streams, I have to imagine it's okay for audio streams.<br><br>So, to clarify: is this "100ms" a typo for "1000 ms"?<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>§7.2:<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Name&nbsp; &nbsp;  | Value | Specification |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | AESKW128 |&nbsp; &nbsp;  1 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | AESKW256 |&nbsp; &nbsp;  2 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Reserved |&nbsp;  255 | RFCAAAA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +----------+-------+---------------+<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Table 3: EKT Cipher Types<br><br>Section 5.2.1 reserves "0" as well.

It’s easy to read and understand. However, I have a few substantive comments/questions and some editorial comments. I would like to at least discuss the substantive comments before going to IETF LC.<br><br>*** Substantive Comments: ***<br><br>§3: Is there a reason not to use the <a href="/doc/rfc8174/">RFC 8174</a> boilerplate? There are at least a few instances of lowercase keywords in places that don’t seem intended as normative.<br><br>§4.2.1, first paragraph: Is there never a situation where you send neither version?&nbsp; Also, did I miss a description of the purpose and semantics for ShortEKTField, other than “send it when you don’t send the full version”?<br><br>§4.2.2, step 3: "If the EKT decryption operation returns an authentication failure, then the packet processing stops.”<br><br>... and then what? <br><br>- Step 6: "This applies in transforms such as [ <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-perc-double/">I-D.ietf-perc-double</a>] for replacing just half the key, but SHOULD return a processing error otherwise.”<br><br>I don’t understand that sentence. Is the point to say that using a “too short” key to replace part of the old key is only valid for perc-double or similar transforms, and receiving one in other contexts is an error?<br><br>- Next Sentence: "Outbound packets SHOULD continue to use the old SRTP Master Key for 250 ms after” Does that imply a normative requirement for recipients to keep old keys around for at least that long? There’s currently an implementation suggestion about that, but it doesn’t use MUST or SHOULD.<br>(Editorial: The sentence seems to belong in the “outbound” section, not the “inbound” section.)<br><br>§4.3:<br><br>- “ This ciphertext value MAY be cached by an SRTP<br>&nbsp;  receiver to minimize computational effort by noting when the SRTP<br>&nbsp;  master key is unchanged and avoiding repeating the steps defined in .”<br><br>Are we really talking about the recipient? How would the recipient know that the key has not changed without processing the ciphertext value? (Also, the sentence is unfinished--maybe the answer would be clear if the rest of the sentence came out of hiding :-) )<br><br>- “ The receiver may want to have a sliding window to retain old SRTP<br>&nbsp;  Master Keys (and related context) for some brief period of time, so<br>&nbsp;  that out of order packets can be processed as well as packets sent<br>&nbsp;  during the time keys are changing.”<br><br>See comment to §4.2.2, step 6. “may want” seems weak given that the sender SHOULD keep using the old key for a period of time.<br><br>§4.7: “A new sender SHOULD send a packet containing the FullEKTField as soon as possible...”<br><br>Why not MUST? Would it ever make sense not to do this? It seems like the mechanism doesn’t work very well otherwise.<br><br>§6, first paragraph: “or other” - what other?<br><br>- paragraph 8: “ An endpoint MUST NOT encrypt more than T different FullEKTField values using the same EKTKey.”<br><br>Is there a reciprocal requirement for decryption?<br><br>- last paragraph: “...SHOULD be limited using the ekt_ttl”<br><br>Why not MUST?<br><br>§7.3: Should this cite <a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC 5246</a> instead of <a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC 4366</a>?<br><br>*** Editorial Comments: *** <br><br>§2: “...each endpoint picks there own SRTP master key...:<br>s/their/its<br><br>§4.1, first paragraph: Please reference figures by number. I can imagine some future RFC rendering failing to&nbsp; maintain the relative positions.&nbsp; (This occurs a few times throughout the document.)<br><br>§4.2.2, step 3:<br>Should "The EKTCiphertext authentication is checked and is decrypted” be something like “ <br>The EKTCiphertext field authentication is checked and its contents decrypted” I assume you don’t mean to say its authentication is decrypted.<br><br>Also, there’s a number of occurrences of “The [fieldname]...” that should probably say “The [fieldname] field...”<br><br>- Step 6: s/crypto/cryptographic<br><br>- Step 7: is the replay protection part relevant to the step?<br><br>§4.3, third paragraph: This is the first mention of ekt_ttl. It would help to have a brief explanation or at least a forward reference.<br><br>§4.6: s/ “other specification” / “another specification” ; or “other specifications”<br><br>§4.7, third paragraph: Both occurrences of “which” need preceding commas.<br><br>§5.2, paragraph after figure 4: “ ... the extensions defined in this session allows the DTLS server...”<br>Defined in this “session” or this “section”?<br><br>§, paragraph 7: “... causing the receiving system will decrypt...”<br>s/will/to<br><br><br></div></td>
