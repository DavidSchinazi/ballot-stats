To help us talk these through the remaining issues, I have updated my ballot to remove issues that have already been resolved.&nbsp; I have also provided feedback on the new text in -29 intended to resolve the original DISCUSS points.<br><br>(1) The Privacy Considerations are under-specified:<br><br>(1.a) [per -28] Section 6.3 suggests the needs for logging, “To deal with this kind of security issue, for monitoring suspicious behaviors, vehicles' communication activities can be recorded in either a central way through a logging server (e.g., TCC) in the vehicular cloud or a distributed way (e.g., blockchain [Bitcoin]) along with other vehicles or infrastructure.&nbsp; To solve the issue ultimately, we need a solution where, without&nbsp; &nbsp; privacy breakage, …”.&nbsp; Some discussion on the “privacy breakage” is needed.&nbsp; What exactly would be the trade offs between a centralized vs. distributed log?&nbsp; Who would get to see this information?&nbsp; What is sensitive about this information?<br><br>From -29:<br>&nbsp;  Alternatively, for<br>&nbsp;  completely secure vehicular networks, we shall embrace the concept of<br>&nbsp;  "zero-trust" for vehicles in which no vehicle is trustable and<br>&nbsp;  verifying every message (such as IPv6 control messages including ND,<br>&nbsp;  DAD, NUD, and application layer messages) is necessary.&nbsp; In this way,<br>&nbsp;  a failure to prevent a cyberattack shall never happen on a vehicular<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; Thus, we need to have an efficient zero-trust framework or<br>&nbsp;  mechanism for vehicular networks.<br><br>I’m speculating that the second from last sentence, “[i]n this way, a failure to prevent a cyberattack shall never happen on a vehicular network” was added to partially respond to the above feedback.&nbsp; Saying that an attack will “never” success due to a zero-trust framework is not plausible.&nbsp; Could this please rephrased.<br><br>(1.b) [per -28] Section 3.3 notes a V2P use case where the pedestrian’s smart-phone is sharing unspecified information.&nbsp; Does that include location<br>information?&nbsp; Who gets it?&nbsp; What kind of identifiers are shared?<br><br>Thanks for adding the following text -29:<br><br>&nbsp;  The location information of a VRU from a smart device is multicasted<br>&nbsp;  only to the nearby vehicles.&nbsp; The true identifiers of a VRU's<br>&nbsp;  smartphone shall be protected, and only the type of the VRU, such as<br>&nbsp;  pedestrian, cyclist, and scooter, is disclosed to the nearby<br>&nbsp;  vehicles.<br><br>To clarify, this “multicasted” in the IPv6 sense?&nbsp; The VRU’s smartphone is using some kind of “fake identifier” (source address?) to announce its presence so as not to reveal its “true identifier”?&nbsp; Is there a security consideration (attack) that these “fake identifiers” multicasting to nearby vehicles could convince that vehicle that they are surrounded by pedestrians (e.g., roughly <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-04/man-creates-fake-traffic-jam-on-google-maps-by-carting-99-phones/11929136)?">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-04/man-creates-fake-traffic-jam-on-google-maps-by-carting-99-phones/11929136)?</a>&nbsp; <br><br>Can we state the security properties or provide a reference to handle this issue.&nbsp; I see the following text later in the section:<br><br>&nbsp;  To support applications of these V2X use cases, the required<br>&nbsp;  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange, transport-layer<br>&nbsp;  session continuity, and secure, safe communication between a vehicle<br>&nbsp;  and a pedestrian either directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU.<br><br>I don’t recognize the desired properties of protecting identifiers as being congruent with the above text.<br><br>(2) Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that it is dangerous if the<br>&nbsp;  internal network of a vehicle is controlled by a malicious party.&nbsp; To<br>&nbsp;  minimize this kind of risk, an reinforced identification and<br>&nbsp;  verification protocol shall be implemented. <br><br>-- [per -28] Who are the parties in this verification protocol?&nbsp; What security properties is this verification providing?<br><br>[new per -29] Thanks for adding this new text in -29 in response:<br><br>&nbsp;  To minimize this kind of risk,<br>&nbsp;  an augmented identification and verification protocol with extra<br>&nbsp;  means shall be implemented.&nbsp; These extra means can be certificate-<br>&nbsp;  based, biometric, credit-based, and one-time passcode (OTP)<br>&nbsp;  approaches in addition to a used approach [<a href="/doc/rfc8002/">RFC8002</a>].&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  verification shall provide security properties such as<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, and<br>&nbsp;  accounting [<a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC7427</a>].<br><br>I’m having trouble understanding this guidance.&nbsp; The architecture is suggesting “augmented identification and verification with extra means.”&nbsp; I don’t follow what “augmented means” or “extra” -- augmented or extra from what baseline?&nbsp; The security properties this provides is “confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization and accounting” don’t seem to match authentication and identity topics.&nbsp; <br><br>To the specific examples, how does “credit-based” provide the stated security properties?&nbsp;  I have the same question for the others. <br><br>** [per -28 and same for -29] The need for safety properties (very helpful) is asserted multiple times but not further discussed in the Security Considerations:<br><br>-- Section 3:&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In addition, IPv6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; security needs to be extended to support those V2V use cases in a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; safe, secure, privacy-preserving way.<br><br>-- Section 3.1: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To support applications of these V2V use cases, the required<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange and secure,&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  safe communication between two vehicles.&nbsp; <br><br>-- Section 3.3:<br>&nbsp;  To support applications of these V2X use cases, the required<br>&nbsp;  functions of IPv6 include IPv6-based packet exchange, transport-layer<br>&nbsp;  session continuity, and secure, safe communication between a vehicle<br>&nbsp;  and a pedestrian either directly or indirectly via an IP-RSU.<br><br>The explanation from the authors noted that the following text was added to Section 4.2 -29:<br><br>“A malicious party can be a group of hackers, a criminal group, and a competitor for industrial espionage or sabotage.”<br><br>“The verification shall provide security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, and accounting [<a href="/doc/rfc7427/">RFC7427</a>].”<br><br>I’m having trouble understanding how this text addresses the safety properties.</div></td>

So the text below should be updated to be corrected:<br>&nbsp; "their own IPv6 Unique Local Addresses<br>&nbsp;  (ULAs) [<a href="/doc/rfc4193/">RFC4193</a>] over the wireless network, which does not require<br>&nbsp;  the messaging (e.g., Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)) of IPv6<br>&nbsp;  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [<a href="/doc/rfc4862/">RFC4862</a>]."<br><br>## Section 4.2<br><br>Very similar comment as above (i.e., DAD &amp; MLD must be done for all IPv6 addresses of an interface and not only for the global one):<br>&nbsp; "... When global IPv6<br>&nbsp;  addresses are used, wireless interface configuration and control<br>&nbsp;  overhead for DAD"<br><br>## Section 5.2<br>&nbsp; "... If DHCPv6 is used to assign<br>&nbsp;  a unique IPv6 address to each vehicle in this shared link, DAD is not<br>&nbsp;  required. "<br>This is incorrect and must be changed (see section 18.2.10.1. of <a href="/doc/rfc8415/">RFC 8415</a>)<br><br># COMMENTS (just for archiving)<br><br>"100km/h as the speed limit in highway" will make many European drivers smile as it is really slow...<br><br>## Section 1<br><br>"Most countries and regions in the world have adopted the same frequency allocation for vehicular networks." but there are TWO frequency allocations described just before, so, which one has been adopted ? <br><br>## Section 2<br><br>"GPS" is just the USA commercial example of the more generic "global navigation satellite system" (GNSS), GNSS should be used in this document. <br><br>As IP-RSU have at least 2 interfaces, should "Also, it may have *the* third IP-enabled wireless interface" be replaced by "Also, it may have *a* third IP-enabled wireless interface" ?<br><br>LiDAR ... "by measuring the reflected pulsed light" but on which kind of metrics ?<br><br>## Section 3.1<br><br>Should the 1st and 5th bullets be grouped together ?<br><br>Please describe "UAM" (e.g., in the terminology section) as it is unclear to the reader whether it is a crewed / uncrewed aircraft.<br><br>If both road and air vehicles are use case, what about river / sea ships or trains ?<br><br>Does the paragraph about "reward system" belong to the use case ? It rather sounds like a business requirement. Suggest to remove this part.<br><br>Like written by Pascal Thubert in his telechat review, the last paragraph "IPv6-based packet exchange and secure" should be clear that this is not only about data plane traffic but also control plane L2/L3 ones. Please also use the Oxford comma, i.e., add a "," after "exchange".<br><br>## Section 3.2<br><br>Suggest to also mention "5G" after "IP-RSU or 4G-LTE networks"<br><br>How is the UAM use case different from a driverless terrestrial EV ? Suggest to merge those use cases.<br><br>## Section 4.1<br><br>As noted by other ADs, "Existing network architectures," the list should not include OMNI yet as it is not deployed and would probably not be described as an architecture.<br><br>"the wireless media interfaces are autoconfigured with a global IPv6 prefix", is it the same shared prefix or multiple prefixes ?<br><br>Is "RSU" the same concept as "IP-RSU" ?<br><br>The last paragraph is about TCP session continuity, but does not explain why multi-path TCP or QUIC session resumption cannot be used.<br><br>## Section 4.2<br><br>The computation about "dwell time" is interesting even if it is computed in the best case. But, I really wonder whether using IPv6 and routing are applicable to the use case as opposed to more layer-2 + tunnel solutions (like 3GPP) with such short time for hand-over. I am a strong supporter of layer-3 (IPv6 and routing), but I cannot refrain from thinking that IPv6 is the wrong technical solution for those use cases... Was this discussed in the WG ?<br><br>## Section 5.1<br><br>What is "legacy DAD" ?<br><br>&nbsp; "...the NA interval needs to be<br>&nbsp;  dynamically adjusted according to a vehicle's speed so that the<br>&nbsp;  vehicle can maintain its neighboring vehicles in a stable way"<br>With the issues linked to multicast over wireless, are the authors and the WG sure that increasing the amount of multicast will not aggravate the problem ? See <a href="/doc/rfc9119/">RFC 9119</a> (cited as a normative down reference)<br><br>## Section 5.1.2<br><br>Please add some references to the MADINAS WG current work items. The authors may also consider adding this use case to the MADINAS use case.<br><br>"The pseudonym of a MAC address affects an IPv6 address based on the MAC address", nearly no implementations use EUI-64 anymore so this part should probably be removed from the document. But, the change of MAC address probably has other impact on the IP stack, e.g., the neighbour cache.<br><br>## Section 5.1.3<br><br>AFAIK, RPL relies on messages to discover the topology and I am afraid that in such a moving / dynamic environment, there will be too many of RPL messages. Will RPL scale in this ever changing network ? Please note that I am not a RPL expert.<br><br>## Section 6.1<br><br>Some explanations on how SEND protects against DAD flooding would be welcome.<br><br>Is "classical IPv6 ND" the same as the previously used "legacy ND" ?<br><br>Wondering why "Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)" is suggested to be used as SubjectAltName in a certificate rather than a car manufacturer cert ?<br><br>## Section 6.3<br><br>The part about bitcoin and blockchain errs probably too far away from the IETF remit.<br><br>## Appendix B<br><br>I fail to understand how RPL and OMNI can be compared as they are vastly different technologies (routing vs. tunneling).<br><br>"In OMNI protocol, each wireless media interface is configured with an IPv6 Unique Local Address (ULA)" but from my last read of OMNI drafts (1+ year ago), the OMNI virtual interface can have a ULA indeed but the wireless physical ones are using any prefix.<br><br>## Appendix D<br><br>What will be the impact of high packet loss rate (that I am expecting on such networks) on IP parcels ?<br><br># NITS&nbsp; <br><br>Please check that all IPv6 addresses are in lowercase (e.g., in section 4.1).</div></td>

Editorial?<br>&nbsp;  For this battery charging schedule, a UAM<br>&nbsp;  end system can communicate with an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU)<br>&nbsp;  toward a cloud server via V2I communications.<br><br>Is there is a missing word here.&nbsp; What does it mean to “... communicate with an infrastructure node … toward a cloud server”<br><br>** Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  It is reasonable to consider the<br>&nbsp;  interaction between the internal network and an external network<br>&nbsp;  within another vehicle or an EN.&nbsp;  <br><br>Can the intent of this be clarified?&nbsp; Isn’t something on the internal vehicle network talking to another vehicle the definition of V2V per Section 3.1?<br><br>** Section 4.2.&nbsp; Is there any expectation of any perimeter-based policy enforcement between this internal network and the edge network (e.g., firewall?).<br><br>** Section 4.3.&nbsp; Is there implicit trust between the platooning vehicles?&nbsp; Security impact if one becomes untrusted?<br><br>** Section 5.<br>&nbsp;  For safe driving, vehicles need to exchange application messages<br>&nbsp;  every 0.5 second [NHTSA-ACAS-Report] to let drivers take an action to<br>&nbsp;  avoid a dangerous situation (e.g., vehicle collision), so IPv6<br>&nbsp;  protocol exchanges&nbsp; need to support this order of magnitude for<br>&nbsp;  application message exchanges.&nbsp; <br><br>This is a helpful performance envelope.&nbsp; Can this be more tightly linked to IPv6?&nbsp; It seems like this kind of performance is related to the capabilities of the link layer to move the IPv6 packets fast enough.<br><br>** Section 5.1.1<br>&nbsp;  For instance, some IPv6 protocols assume symmetry in the connectivity<br>&nbsp;  among neighboring interfaces [<a href="/doc/rfc6250/">RFC6250</a>].&nbsp; <br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6250/">RFC6250</a> (Section 3.1.1) seems to be saying the opposite of this sentence which is that symmetry can’t be assumed.&nbsp; What protocols are making this assumption?<br><br>** Section 5.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  However, the pseudonym handling is not<br>&nbsp;  implemented and tested yet for applications on IP-based vehicular<br>&nbsp;  networking. <br><br>No issues.&nbsp; However, isn’t this true for all of the VIP and VND work (as in, it needs more testing)?<br><br>** Section 6.<br><br>&nbsp;  For the authentication in<br>&nbsp;  vehicular networks, vehicular cloud needs to support a kind of Public<br>&nbsp;  Key Infrastructure (PKI) in an efficient way.<br><br>What does the qualifier of “a kind of” PKI mean?<br><br>** Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  Also, in-vehicle devices (e.g.,<br>&nbsp;  ECU) and a driver/passenger's mobile devices (e.g., smartphone and<br>&nbsp;  tablet PC) in a vehicle need to communicate with other in-vehicle<br>&nbsp;  devices and another driver/passenger's mobile devices in another<br>&nbsp;  vehicle, or other servers behind an IP-RSU in a secure way. <br><br>Is securing arbitrary communication between a smartphone-A in vehicle-1 and smartphone-B in vehicle-2 in scope?<br><br>** Section 6.<br>&nbsp;  Even<br>&nbsp;  though a vehicle is perfectly authenticated and legitimate,<br><br>What does it mean for a vehicle to be legitimate?&nbsp; Authenticated to whom?<br><br>** Section 6<br>&nbsp;  Note that when driver/passenger's mobile devices are<br>&nbsp;  connected to a vehicle's internal network, the vehicle may be more<br>&nbsp;  vulnerable to possible attacks from external networks.<br><br>This doesn’t seem framed right.&nbsp; Why is it _more vulnerable_?&nbsp; More relative to what?&nbsp; I think the central idea is that like any network (e.g., public library, IETF conference network), the end-node assumes risk of its packets transiting a network it doesn’t control, and exposes itself to “local network/segment” attacks of any peer nodes on the network.<br><br>** Section 6.3<br>&nbsp;  Alternatively, for<br>&nbsp;  completely secure vehicular networks, we shall embrace the concept of<br>&nbsp;  "zero-trust" for vehicles in which no vehicle is trustable and<br>&nbsp;  verifying every message is necessary.&nbsp; For doing so, we shall have an<br>&nbsp;  efficient zero-trust framework or mechanism for vehicular networks.<br><br>-- What is a “completely secure vehicular network”?<br><br>-- There seems to be an architecture mismatch in this aspirational zero trust architecture.&nbsp; How does the premise of “verifying every message” align with focus of this document being IPv6 protocol mechanisms.&nbsp; What is an “IPv6 message”?&nbsp; Is that a packet?&nbsp; It would seem to me that these messages would be application layer matters.<br><br>** Section 6.3<br><br>Each message from a<br>&nbsp;  vehicle can be treated as a transaction and the neighboring vehicles<br>&nbsp;  can play the role of peers in a consensus method of a blockchain<br>&nbsp;  [Bitcoin] [Vehicular-BlockChain].<br><br>Same comment as for ZT -- what is an “IPv6 message” that could be put on a blockchain?<br><br>** Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  For the non-repudiation of the harmful activities of malicious nodes,<br>&nbsp;  a blockchain technology can be used [Bitcoin].&nbsp; Each message from a<br>&nbsp;  vehicle can be treated as a transaction and the neighboring vehicles<br>&nbsp;  can play the role of peers in a consensus method of a blockchain<br>&nbsp;  [Bitcoin] [Vehicular-BlockChain].&nbsp; For a blockchain's efficient<br>&nbsp;  consensus in vehicular networks having fast moving vehicles, a new<br>&nbsp;  consensus algorithm needs to be developed or an existing consensus<br>&nbsp;  algorithm needs to be enhanced.<br><br>Given the architecture layout in Figures 1 – 5?&nbsp; Where does this block live?&nbsp;
