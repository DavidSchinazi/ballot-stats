I will duly ballot Yes, as promised.<br><br>However, I will retain unchanged the COMMENT section from my ballot<br>position on the -16, since on further inspection there are many of<br>them that do not seem to have been discussed in github yet.<br><br>I also had one new comment on the -17: in Section 10.2 we had some<br>good text cleanup (I think, prompted by one of my comments -- thank you!),<br>but the removed text included a note about how the semantics of a response<br>header field might be refined by the semantics of the request method and/or<br>the response status code.&nbsp; That seems like it would be useful to have<br>mentioned, and I'm not sure if this text was replicated elsewhere.<br><br>=====BEGIN PREVIOUS COMMENT SECTION=====<br>This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc3864/">RFC 3864</a>, which is part of <a href="/doc/bcp90/">BCP 90</a>.<br>However, this document is targeting Proposed Standard status, which<br>means it cannot become a part of <a href="/doc/bcp90/">BCP 90</a> as part of that update.<br>Did we consider splitting out the <a href="/doc/rfc3864/">RFC 3864</a> updates into a separate,<br>BCP-level, document, that would become part of <a href="/doc/bcp90/">BCP 90</a>?<br><br>Section 1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  HTTP/2 ([<a href="/doc/rfc7540/">RFC7540</a>]) introduced a multiplexed session layer on top of<br>&nbsp;  the existing TLS and TCP protocols for exchanging concurrent HTTP<br>&nbsp;  messages with efficient field compression and server push.&nbsp; HTTP/3<br>&nbsp;  ([HTTP3]) provides greater independence for concurrent messages by<br>&nbsp;  using QUIC as a secure multiplexed transport over UDP instead of TCP.<br><br>My understanding was that h2 and h3 also use non-text-based headers, in<br>contrast to HTTP/1.1's "text-based messaging syntax" that we mention<br>earlier.&nbsp; Is that non-text nature worth noting here?<br><br>Section 3.7<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Proxies are often used to group an<br>&nbsp;  organization's HTTP requests through a common intermediary for the<br>&nbsp;  sake of security, annotation services, or shared caching.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>The term "security" can mean so many different things to different<br>audiences that its meaning in isolation is pretty minimal.&nbsp; I suggest<br>finding a more specific term for the intended usage, perhaps relating to<br>an auditing, exfiltration protection, and/or content-filtering function.<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, an _interception proxy_ [<a href="/doc/rfc3040/">RFC3040</a>] (also commonly known<br>&nbsp;  as a _transparent proxy_ [<a href="/doc/rfc1919/">RFC1919</a>]) differs from an HTTP proxy<br>&nbsp;  because it is not chosen by the client.&nbsp; Instead, an interception<br>&nbsp;  proxy filters or redirects outgoing TCP port 80 packets (and<br>&nbsp;  occasionally other common port traffic).&nbsp; Interception proxies are<br>&nbsp;  commonly found on public network access points, as a means of<br>&nbsp;  enforcing account subscription prior to allowing use of non-local<br>&nbsp;  Internet services, and within corporate firewalls to enforce network<br>&nbsp;  usage policies.<br><br>Is this text still accurate in the era of https-everywhere and Let's<br>Encrypt?<br><br>Section 3.9<br><br>As Éric notes, OpenSSL 0.9.7l supports only SSL and TLSv1.0, which per<br><a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a> is no longer permitted -- I concur with his recommendation to<br>update the example (potentially including Last-Modified).<br><br>Section 4.2.x<br><br>&nbsp;  The hierarchical path component and optional query component identify<br>&nbsp;  the target resource within that origin server's name space.<br><br>Would a <a href="/doc/bcp190/">BCP 190</a> reference be appropriate here (emphasizing that the name<br>space belongs to the origin server)?<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The "https" URI scheme is hereby defined for minting identifiers<br>&nbsp;  within the hierarchical namespace governed by a potential origin<br>&nbsp;  server listening for TCP connections on a given port and capable of<br>&nbsp;  establishing a TLS ([<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>]) connection that has been secured for<br>&nbsp;  HTTP communication.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is "capable" the correct prerequisite, or does the server need to<br>actually do so on that port?&nbsp; (Given the following definition of<br>"secured", though, the ability to successfully do so would seem to<br>depend on the trust anchor configuration on the client, which is not<br>really something the server can control...)<br><br>Section 4.3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Note, however, that the above is not the only means for obtaining an<br>&nbsp;  authoritative response, nor does it imply that an authoritative<br>&nbsp;  response is always necessary (see [Caching]).<br><br>Is it intentional that this paragraph diverges from the analogous<br>content in §4.3.2 (which also mentions Alt-Svc and other protocols<br>"outside the scope of this document")?<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* In practice, the "Set-Cookie" header field ([<a href="/doc/rfc6265/">RFC6265</a>])<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; often appears in a response message across multiple field lines<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; and does not use the list syntax, violating the above<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; requirements on multiple field lines with the same field name.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Since it cannot be combined into a single field value,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; recipients ought to handle "Set-Cookie" as a special case while<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; processing fields.&nbsp; (See Appendix A.2.3 of [Kri2001] for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; details.)<br><br>The reference seems to conclude only that the situation for "Set-Cookie"<br>is underspecified, and doesn't really give me much guidance on what to<br>do if I receive a message with multiple field lines for "Set-Cookie".<br>(It does talk about the "Cookie" field and how semicolon is used to<br>separate cookie values, which implies that "Cookie" would get special<br>treatment to use semicolon to join field lines, but doesn't really give<br>me the impression that "Set-Cookie" should also have such treatment.)<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MAY discard or truncate received field lines that are larger<br>&nbsp;  than the client wishes to process if the field semantics are such<br>&nbsp;  that the dropped value(s) can be safely ignored without changing the<br>&nbsp;  message framing or response semantics.<br><br>Is it worth saying anything about fields that the client does not<br>recognize?&nbsp; (Per the previous discussion, the server needs to either<br>know that the client recognizes the field or only send fields that are<br>safe to ignore if unrecognized, if I understand correctly...)<br><br>Section 6.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In a response, the content's purpose is defined by both the request<br>&nbsp;  method and the response status code (Section 15).&nbsp; For example, the<br>&nbsp;  content of a 200 (OK) response to GET (Section 9.3.1) represents the<br>&nbsp;  current state of the target resource, as observed at the time of the<br>&nbsp;  message origination date (Section 10.2.2), whereas the content of the<br>&nbsp;  same status code in a response to POST might represent either the<br>&nbsp;  processing result or the new state of the target resource after<br>&nbsp;  applying the processing.<br><br>Doesn't the last clause mean that there is some additional (meta)data<br>that can affect the content's purpose (e.g., a Content-Location field)?<br>Or how else would one know if the 200 POST response is the processing<br>result vs the new state?&nbsp;

 A server SHOULD NOT use the From header field for access control or<br>&nbsp;  authentication.<br><br>It seems that the level of security provided by the From header field is<br>at most that of a bearer token, and that the natural choice of such<br>token is easily guessable (though unguessable choices are possible).<br>I'm having a hard time coming up with an IETF-consensus scenario where<br>it would make sense to use From for access control or authentication<br>(i.e., could this be MUST NOT instead?).<br><br>Section 10.1.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some servers use the Referer header field as a means of<br>&nbsp;  denying links from other sites (so-called "deep linking") or<br>&nbsp;  restricting cross-site request forgery (CSRF), but not all requests<br>&nbsp;

 The TE field value consists of a list of tokens, each allowing for<br>&nbsp;  optional parameters (except for the special case "trailers").<br><br>Should the prose mention the 'weight' part of the t-codings construction<br>(the "weight" production itself does not seem to be defined until §11.4.2)?<br><br>Section 10.1.5<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, a sender might indicate that a message integrity check<br>&nbsp;  will be computed as the content is being streamed and provide the<br>&nbsp;  final signature as a trailer field.&nbsp; This allows a recipient to<br><br>Please pick one of "message integrity check" and "signature" and use it<br>consistently; these are both cryptographic terms of art (with different<br>meanings).<br><br>&nbsp;  Because the Trailer field is not removed by intermediaries, it can<br>&nbsp;  also be used by downstream recipients to discover when a trailer<br>&nbsp;  field has been removed from a message.<br><br>It seems that this usage is only possible if sending the Trailer field is a<br>binding commitment to emit the relevant trailer fields; otherwise the<br>recipient cannot distinguish between a removal by an intermediary and a sender<br>declining to generate the trailer field.<br><br>Section 10.1.6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A user agent SHOULD send a User-Agent header field in each<br>&nbsp;  request unless specifically configured not to do so.<br><br>(I assume that a reference to client-hints (or UA-CH) was considered and<br>rejected.)<br><br>&nbsp;  A user agent SHOULD NOT generate a User-Agent header field containing<br>&nbsp;  needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the addition of<br>&nbsp;  subproducts by third parties.&nbsp; Overly long and detailed User-Agent<br>&nbsp;  field values increase request latency and the risk of a user being<br>&nbsp;  identified against their wishes ("fingerprinting").<br><br>client-hints might even be more appropriate as a reference here than it<br>would be above...or just in §17.13.<br><br>Section 10.2<br><br>It seems like it might be worth listing the fields already defined in the<br>previous section (as request context fields) that can also appear as response<br>context fields.<br><br>Section 12.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Reactive negotiation suffers from the disadvantages of transmitting a<br>&nbsp;  list of alternatives to the user agent, which degrades user-perceived<br>&nbsp;  latency if transmitted in the header section, and needing a second<br>&nbsp;  request to obtain an alternate representation.&nbsp; Furthermore, this<br>&nbsp;  specification does not define a mechanism for supporting automatic<br>&nbsp;  selection, though it does not prevent such a mechanism from being<br>&nbsp;  developed as an extension.<br><br>I'm not sure that I understand how an HTTP extension would help specify<br>a mechanism for automatic selection in reactive negotiation; isn't this<br>just an implementation detail in the user-agent?<br><br>Section 12.5.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* Use of the "q" parameter name to control content<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; negotiation is due to historical practice.&nbsp; Although this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; prevents any media type parameter named "q" from being used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; with a media range, such an event is believed to be unlikely<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; given the lack of any "q" parameters in the IANA media type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; registry and the rare usage of any media type parameters in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Accept.&nbsp; Future media types are discouraged from registering<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; any parameter named "q".<br><br>This note seems like it would be more useful in the IANA media-types<br>registry than "some random protocol specification that uses media<br>types".<br><br>Section 12.5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  For example,<br><br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding:<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: *<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0<br><br>Are these supposed to be multiple standalone examples or one single example with<br>multiple field lines?&nbsp; (I note that they appear in a single <br>element in the XML source.)&nbsp; If they are supposed to be one single<br>example, I would have expected some remark about the combination of "*"<br>and "*;q=0" (my understanding is that the q=0 renders codings not listed<br>as unacceptable, even despite the implicitly q=1 wildcard).<br>It seems that in other instances where we provide multiple examples in<br>a single artwork, the prefacing text is "Examples:" plural, that makes<br>some effort to disambiguate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* Most HTTP/1.0 applications do not recognize or obey<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; qvalues associated with content-codings.&nbsp; This means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; qvalues might not work and are not permitted with x-gzip or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; x-compress.<br><br>This wording implies to me that there is a normative requirement<br>somewhere else that qvalues cannot be used with x-gzip and x-compress,<br>but I'm not sure where that would be.&nbsp; (It's also a bit hard to<br>understand how x-gzip would be affected but not plain gzip, given that<br>§18.6 lists it as an alias for gzip ... additional restrictions don't<br>quite match up with an "alias" nature.)<br><br>Section 12.5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send<br>&nbsp;  an Accept-Language header field with the complete linguistic<br>&nbsp;  preferences of the user in every request (Section 17.13).<br><br>This leaves me wondering how to improve on the situation and pick which<br>subset of requests to send the header field in.&nbsp; I would expect that a<br>blind random sampling approach would not yield privacy improvements over<br>always sending them.<br><br>Section 12.5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An origin server SHOULD send a Vary header field when its algorithm<br>&nbsp;  for selecting a representation varies based on aspects of the request<br>&nbsp;  message other than the method and target URI, unless the variance<br>&nbsp;  cannot be crossed or the origin server has been deliberately<br>&nbsp;  configured to prevent cache transparency.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I don't think I know what it means to "cross" a variance.&nbsp; The example<br>(elided from this comment) about Authorization not needing to be<br>included gives some hint as to what is meant, but I still don't have a<br>clear picture.<br><br>Section 13.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; When the method is GET and both Range and If-Range are present,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  evaluate the If-Range precondition:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; if the validator matches and the Range specification is<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* This status code is much younger (June 2014) than its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; sibling codes, and thus might not be recognized everywhere.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Field names are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert<br>&nbsp;  (appointed by the IESG or their delegate).&nbsp; Fields with the status<br>&nbsp;  'permanent' are Specification Required ([<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a>], Section 4.6).<br><br>I would have expected IANA to ask for the phrase "Expert Review" to be<br>used for the general case (if they did not already), since that's the<br>relevant registration policy defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  Registration requests consist of at least the following information:<br>[...]<br>&nbsp;  Specification document(s):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reference to the document that specifies the field, preferably<br><br>If the registration consists of "at least" a group of information that<br>includes a specification document, doesn't that mean the policy is<br>*always* "Specification Required", not just for permanent registrations?<br><br>&nbsp;  Provisional entries can be removed by the Expert(s) if - in<br>&nbsp;  consultation with the community - the Expert(s) find that they are<br>&nbsp;  not in use.&nbsp; The Experts can change a provisional entry's status to<br>&nbsp;  permanent at any time.<br><br>(The ability to freely convert a provisional registration to permanent<br>seems to also require a specification document to always be present,<br>even for provisional registrations.)<br><br>Section 17<br><br>A few potential considerations that don't seem to be mentioned in the<br>subsections:<br><br>- Implementation divergence in handling multi-member field values when<br>&nbsp; singletons are expected, could lead to security issues (in a similar<br>&nbsp; vein as how request smuggling works)<br><br>- Though ETag is formally opaque to clients, any internal structure to<br>&nbsp; the values could still be inspected and attacked by a malicious<br>&nbsp; client.&nbsp; We might consider giving guidance that ETag values should<br>&nbsp; be unpredictable.<br><br>- When the same information is present at multiple protocol layers<br>&nbsp; (e.g., the transport port number and the Host field value), in the<br>&nbsp; general case, attacks are possible if there is not check for<br>&nbsp; consistency of the values in the different layers.&nbsp; It's often helpful<br>&nbsp; to provide guidance on which entit(ies) should perform the check, to<br>&nbsp; avoid scenarios where all parties are expecting "someone else" to do<br>&nbsp; it.<br><br>- Relatedly, the port value is part of the https "origin" concept, but is not<br>&nbsp; authenticated by the certificate and could be modified (in the<br>&nbsp; transport layer) by an on-path attacker.&nbsp; The safety of per-origin<br>&nbsp; isolation relies on the server to check that the port intended by the<br>&nbsp; client matches the port the request was actually received on.<br><br>- We mention that in response to some 3xx redirection responses, a<br>&nbsp; client capable of link editing might do so automatically.&nbsp; Doing so<br>&nbsp; for http-not-s responses would allow for a form of privilege<br>&nbsp; escalation, converting even a temporary access into more permanent<br>&nbsp; changes on referring resources.<br><br>- We make heavy use of URIs and URI components; referencing the security<br>&nbsp; considerations of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> might be worthwhile<br><br>Section 17.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Unfortunately, communicating authority to users can be difficult.<br>&nbsp;

 authority component (see Section 4.2.1).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>We might also mention "confusable" domain names here as well (which are<br>possible even without resorting to IDNs).<br><br>Section 17.5<br><br>Should we also discuss situations where there might be redundant lengths<br>at different encoding layers (e.g., HTTP framing and MIME multipart<br>boundaries), in a similar vein to<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34#section-10.8">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34#section-10.8</a><br>?<br><br>Section 17.16.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 HTTP/2 ([<a href="/doc/rfc7540/">RFC7540</a>]) introduced a multiplexed session layer on top of<br>&nbsp;  the existing TLS and TCP protocols for exchanging concurrent HTTP<br>&nbsp;  messages with efficient field compression and server push.&nbsp; HTTP/3<br>&nbsp;  ([HTTP3]) provides greater independence for concurrent messages by<br>&nbsp;  using QUIC as a secure multiplexed transport over UDP instead of TCP.<br><br>My understanding was that h2 and h3 also use non-text-based headers, in<br>contrast to HTTP/1.1's "text-based messaging syntax" that we mention<br>earlier.&nbsp; Is that non-text nature worth noting here?<br><br>Section 3.7<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Proxies are often used to group an<br>&nbsp;  organization's HTTP requests through a common intermediary for the<br>&nbsp;  sake of security, annotation services, or shared caching.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>The term "security" can mean so many different things to different<br>audiences that its meaning in isolation is pretty minimal.&nbsp; I suggest<br>finding a more specific term for the intended usage, perhaps relating to<br>an auditing, exfiltration protection, and/or content-filtering function.<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, an _interception proxy_ [<a href="/doc/rfc3040/">RFC3040</a>] (also commonly known<br>&nbsp;  as a _transparent proxy_ [<a href="/doc/rfc1919/">RFC1919</a>]) differs from an HTTP proxy<br>&nbsp;  because it is not chosen by the client.&nbsp; Instead, an interception<br>&nbsp;  proxy filters or redirects outgoing TCP port 80 packets (and<br>&nbsp;  occasionally other common port traffic).&nbsp; Interception proxies are<br>&nbsp;  commonly found on public network access points, as a means of<br>&nbsp;  enforcing account subscription prior to allowing use of non-local<br>&nbsp;  Internet services, and within corporate firewalls to enforce network<br>&nbsp;  usage policies.<br><br>Is this text still accurate in the era of https-everywhere and Let's<br>Encrypt?<br><br>Section 3.9<br><br>As Éric notes, OpenSSL 0.9.7l supports only SSL and TLSv1.0, which per<br><a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a> is no longer permitted -- I concur with his recommendation to<br>update the example (potentially including Last-Modified).<br><br>Section 4.2.x<br><br>&nbsp;  The hierarchical path component and optional query component identify<br>&nbsp;  the target resource within that origin server's name space.<br><br>Would a <a href="/doc/bcp190/">BCP 190</a> reference be appropriate here (emphasizing that the name<br>space belongs to the origin server)?<br><br>Section 4.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The "https" URI scheme is hereby defined for minting identifiers<br>&nbsp;  within the hierarchical namespace governed by a potential origin<br>&nbsp;  server listening for TCP connections on a given port and capable of<br>&nbsp;  establishing a TLS ([<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>]) connection that has been secured for<br>&nbsp;  HTTP communication.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Is "capable" the correct prerequisite, or does the server need to<br>actually do so on that port?&nbsp; (Given the following definition of<br>"secured", though, the ability to successfully do so would seem to<br>depend on the trust anchor configuration on the client, which is not<br>really something the server can control...)<br><br>Section 4.3.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Note, however, that the above is not the only means for obtaining an<br>&nbsp;  authoritative response, nor does it imply that an authoritative<br>&nbsp;  response is always necessary (see [Caching]).<br><br>Is it intentional that this paragraph diverges from the analogous<br>content in §4.3.2 (which also mentions Alt-Svc and other protocols<br>"outside the scope of this document")?<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* In practice, the "Set-Cookie" header field ([<a href="/doc/rfc6265/">RFC6265</a>])<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; often appears in a response message across multiple field lines<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; and does not use the list syntax, violating the above<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; requirements on multiple field lines with the same field name.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Since it cannot be combined into a single field value,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; recipients ought to handle "Set-Cookie" as a special case while<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; processing fields.&nbsp; (See Appendix A.2.3 of [Kri2001] for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; details.)<br><br>The reference seems to conclude only that the situation for "Set-Cookie"<br>is underspecified, and doesn't really give me much guidance on what to<br>do if I receive a message with multiple field lines for "Set-Cookie".<br>(It does talk about the "Cookie" field and how semicolon is used to<br>separate cookie values, which implies that "Cookie" would get special<br>treatment to use semicolon to join field lines, but doesn't really give<br>me the impression that "Set-Cookie" should also have such treatment.)<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MAY discard or truncate received field lines that are larger<br>&nbsp;  than the client wishes to process if the field semantics are such<br>&nbsp;  that the dropped value(s) can be safely ignored without changing the<br>&nbsp;  message framing or response semantics.<br><br>Is it worth saying anything about fields that the client does not<br>recognize?&nbsp; (Per the previous discussion, the server needs to either<br>know that the client recognizes the field or only send fields that are<br>safe to ignore if unrecognized, if I understand correctly...)<br><br>Section 6.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  In a response, the content's purpose is defined by both the request<br>&nbsp;  method and the response status code (Section 15).&nbsp; For example, the<br>&nbsp;  content of a 200 (OK) response to GET (Section 9.3.1) represents the<br>&nbsp;  current state of the target resource, as observed at the time of the<br>&nbsp;  message origination date (Section 10.2.2), whereas the content of the<br>&nbsp;  same status code in a response to POST might represent either the<br>&nbsp;  processing result or the new state of the target resource after<br>&nbsp;  applying the processing.<br><br>Doesn't the last clause mean that there is some additional (meta)data<br>that can affect the content's purpose (e.g., a Content-Location field)?<br>Or how else would one know if the 200 POST response is the processing<br>result vs the new state?&nbsp; It seems incomplete to just say "is defined by<br>both" and list only method and status code as the defining factors.<br><br>Section 7.6.3<br><br>[I had the same question as Martin Duke about default *TCP* port, and<br>the interaction with the scheme.&nbsp; I see that it has been answered since<br>I initially drafted these notes, hooray.]<br><br>Section 7.7<br><br>&nbsp;  A proxy MUST NOT modify the "absolute-path" and "query" parts of the<br>&nbsp;  received target URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server,<br>&nbsp;

(What's the actual expected behavior for that<br>situation?)<br><br>Section 9.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A request method is considered _idempotent_ if the intended effect on<br>&nbsp;  the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the<br>&nbsp;  same as the effect for a single such request.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I sometimes worry that a definition of idempotent like this hides the<br>interaction of repeated idempotent requests with other requests<br>modifying the same resource.&nbsp; A+A is equivalent to A, but A+B+A is often<br>not equivalent to A+B...<br><br>Section 9.3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Likewise, other implementation aspects of a resource might need to be<br>&nbsp;  deactivated or archived as a result of a DELETE, such as database or<br>&nbsp;  gateway connections.&nbsp; In general, it is assumed that the origin<br>&nbsp;  server will only allow DELETE on resources for which it has a<br>&nbsp;  prescribed mechanism for accomplishing the deletion.<br><br>The specific phrasing of "only allow DELETE [...]" calls to mind (for<br>me) an expectation of authorization checks as well.&nbsp; In some sense this<br>is no different than for POST or PUT, and thus may not be worth<br>particular mention here, but I thought I'd ask whether it makes sense to<br>mention authorization (and authentication).<br><br>&nbsp;  A client SHOULD NOT generate content in a DELETE request.&nbsp; Content<br>&nbsp;  received in a DELETE request has no defined semantics, cannot alter<br>&nbsp;  the meaning or target of the request, and might lead some<br>&nbsp;  implementations to reject the request.<br><br>We had a similar paragraph earlier in the discussion of GET and HEAD,<br>but those paragraphs included a clause about "close the connection<br>because of its potential as a request smuggling attack" -- is DELETE not<br>at risk of use for request smuggling?<br><br>Section 10.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; A server that responds with a final status code before reading the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entire request content SHOULD indicate whether it intends to close<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the connection (e.g., see Section 9.6 of [Messaging]) or continue<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reading the request content.<br><br>The referenced section seems to cover the "close" connection option,<br>which is a positive signal of intent to close.&nbsp; Is the absence of that<br>connection option to be interpreted as a positive signal of intent to<br>continue reading the request content, or is there some other positive<br>signal of such intent to continue reading?<br><br>Section 10.1.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A server SHOULD NOT use the From header field for access control or<br>&nbsp;  authentication.<br><br>It seems that the level of security provided by the From header field is<br>at most that of a bearer token, and that the natural choice of such<br>token is easily guessable (though unguessable choices are possible).<br>I'm having a hard time coming up with an IETF-consensus scenario where<br>it would make sense to use From for access control or authentication<br>(i.e., could this be MUST NOT instead?).<br><br>Section 10.1.3<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Some servers use the Referer header field as a means of<br>&nbsp;  denying links from other sites (so-called "deep linking") or<br>&nbsp;  restricting cross-site request forgery (CSRF), but not all requests<br>&nbsp;  contain it.<br><br>I think we should say something about the effectiveness of Referer<br>checks as a CSRF mitigation mechanism.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most general-purpose user agents do not send the<br>&nbsp;  Referer header field when the referring resource is a local "file" or<br>&nbsp;  "data" URI.&nbsp; A user agent SHOULD NOT send a Referer header field if<br><br>This seems like a curious statement.&nbsp; Are we expecting future<br>general-purpose user agents to emulate this behavior?&nbsp; If so, then why<br>not recommend it explicitly?<br><br>&nbsp;  the referring resource was accessed with a secure protocol and the<br>&nbsp;  request target has an origin differing from that of the referring<br>&nbsp;  resource, unless the referring resource explicitly allows Referer to<br>&nbsp;  be sent.&nbsp; A user agent MUST NOT send a Referer header field in an<br><br>How does a referring resource indicate that Referer should be sent?<br><br>Section 10.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The TE field value consists of a list of tokens, each allowing for<br>&nbsp;  optional parameters (except for the special case "trailers").<br><br>Should the prose mention the 'weight' part of the t-codings construction<br>(the "weight" production itself does not seem to be defined until §11.4.2)?<br><br>Section 10.1.5<br><br>&nbsp;  For example, a sender might indicate that a message integrity check<br>&nbsp;  will be computed as the content is being streamed and provide the<br>&nbsp;  final signature as a trailer field.&nbsp; This allows a recipient to<br><br>Please pick one of "message integrity check" and "signature" and use it<br>consistently; these are both cryptographic terms of art (with different<br>meanings).<br><br>&nbsp;  Because the Trailer field is not removed by intermediaries, it can<br>&nbsp;  also be used by downstream recipients to discover when a trailer<br>&nbsp;  field has been removed from a message.<br><br>It seems that this usage is only possible if sending the Trailer field is a<br>binding commitment to emit the relevant trailer fields; otherwise the<br>recipient cannot distinguish between a removal by an intermediary and a sender<br>declining to generate the trailer field.<br><br>Section 10.1.6<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A user agent SHOULD send a User-Agent header field in each<br>&nbsp;  request unless specifically configured not to do so.<br><br>(I assume that a reference to client-hints (or UA-CH) was considered and<br>rejected.)<br><br>&nbsp;  A user agent SHOULD NOT generate a User-Agent header field containing<br>&nbsp;  needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the addition of<br>&nbsp;  subproducts by third parties.&nbsp; Overly long and detailed User-Agent<br>&nbsp;  field values increase request latency and the risk of a user being<br>&nbsp;  identified against their wishes ("fingerprinting").<br><br>client-hints might even be more appropriate as a reference here than it<br>would be above...or just in §17.13.<br><br>Section 10.2<br><br>It seems like it might be worth listing the fields already defined in the<br>previous section (as request context fields) that can also appear as response<br>context fields.<br><br>Section 12.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Reactive negotiation suffers from the disadvantages of transmitting a<br>&nbsp;  list of alternatives to the user agent, which degrades user-perceived<br>&nbsp;  latency if transmitted in the header section, and needing a second<br>&nbsp;  request to obtain an alternate representation.&nbsp; Furthermore, this<br>&nbsp;  specification does not define a mechanism for supporting automatic<br>&nbsp;  selection, though it does not prevent such a mechanism from being<br>&nbsp;  developed as an extension.<br><br>I'm not sure that I understand how an HTTP extension would help specify<br>a mechanism for automatic selection in reactive negotiation; isn't this<br>just an implementation detail in the user-agent?<br><br>Section 12.5.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* Use of the "q" parameter name to control content<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; negotiation is due to historical practice.&nbsp; Although this<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; prevents any media type parameter named "q" from being used<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; with a media range, such an event is believed to be unlikely<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; given the lack of any "q" parameters in the IANA media type<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; registry and the rare usage of any media type parameters in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Accept.&nbsp; Future media types are discouraged from registering<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; any parameter named "q".<br><br>This note seems like it would be more useful in the IANA media-types<br>registry than "some random protocol specification that uses media<br>types".<br><br>Section 12.5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  For example,<br><br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding:<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: *<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0<br>&nbsp;  Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0<br><br>Are these supposed to be multiple standalone examples or one single example with<br>multiple field lines?&nbsp; (I note that they appear in a single <br>element in the XML source.)&nbsp; If they are supposed to be one single<br>example, I would have expected some remark about the combination of "*"<br>and "*;q=0" (my understanding is that the q=0 renders codings not listed<br>as unacceptable, even despite the implicitly q=1 wildcard).<br>It seems that in other instances where we provide multiple examples in<br>a single artwork, the prefacing text is "Examples:" plural, that makes<br>some effort to disambiguate.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* Most HTTP/1.0 applications do not recognize or obey<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; qvalues associated with content-codings.&nbsp; This means that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; qvalues might not work and are not permitted with x-gzip or<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; x-compress.<br><br>This wording implies to me that there is a normative requirement<br>somewhere else that qvalues cannot be used with x-gzip and x-compress,<br>but I'm not sure where that would be.&nbsp; (It's also a bit hard to<br>understand how x-gzip would be affected but not plain gzip, given that<br>§18.6 lists it as an alias for gzip ... additional restrictions don't<br>quite match up with an "alias" nature.)<br><br>Section 12.5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send<br>&nbsp;  an Accept-Language header field with the complete linguistic<br>&nbsp;  preferences of the user in every request (Section 17.13).<br><br>This leaves me wondering how to improve on the situation and pick which<br>subset of requests to send the header field in.&nbsp; I would expect that a<br>blind random sampling approach would not yield privacy improvements over<br>always sending them.<br><br>Section 12.5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An origin server SHOULD send a Vary header field when its algorithm<br>&nbsp;  for selecting a representation varies based on aspects of the request<br>&nbsp;  message other than the method and target URI, unless the variance<br>&nbsp;  cannot be crossed or the origin server has been deliberately<br>&nbsp;  configured to prevent cache transparency.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I don't think I know what it means to "cross" a variance.&nbsp; The example<br>(elided from this comment) about Authorization not needing to be<br>included gives some hint as to what is meant, but I still don't have a<br>clear picture.<br><br>Section 13.2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  5.&nbsp; When the method is GET and both Range and If-Range are present,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  evaluate the If-Range precondition:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; if the validator matches and the Range specification is<br>&nbsp;

 *&nbsp; all conditions are met, so perform the requested action and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; respond according to its success or failure.<br><br>I think that if the If-Range doesn't match, we're supposed to ignore the<br>Range header field when performing the requested action, which doesn't<br>seem to match up with this unadorned directive to "perform the requested<br>action" (which would include the Range header field).<br>(We might also change point (5) to use the "if true" phrasing that the<br>other items use in the context of evaluating the precondition.)<br><br>Section 15.4.9<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; *Note:* This status code is much younger (June 2014) than its<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; sibling codes, and thus might not be recognized everywhere.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Field names are registered on the advice of a Designated Expert<br>&nbsp;  (appointed by the IESG or their delegate).&nbsp; Fields with the status<br>&nbsp;  'permanent' are Specification Required ([<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC8126</a>], Section 4.6).<br><br>I would have expected IANA to ask for the phrase "Expert Review" to be<br>used for the general case (if they did not already), since that's the<br>relevant registration policy defined in <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;  Registration requests consist of at least the following information:<br>[...]<br>&nbsp;  Specification document(s):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reference to the document that specifies the field, preferably<br><br>If the registration consists of "at least" a group of information that<br>includes a specification document, doesn't that mean the policy is<br>*always* "Specification Required", not just for permanent registrations?<br><br>&nbsp;  Provisional entries can be removed by the Expert(s) if - in<br>&nbsp;  consultation with the community - the Expert(s) find that they are<br>&nbsp;  not in use.&nbsp; The Experts can change a provisional entry's status to<br>&nbsp;  permanent at any time.<br><br>(The ability to freely convert a provisional registration to permanent<br>seems to also require a specification document to always be present,<br>even for provisional registrations.)<br><br>Section 17<br><br>A few potential considerations that don't seem to be mentioned in the<br>subsections:<br><br>- Implementation divergence in handling multi-member field values when<br>&nbsp; singletons are expected, could lead to security issues (in a similar<br>&nbsp; vein as how request smuggling works)<br><br>- Though ETag is formally opaque to clients, any internal structure to<br>&nbsp; the values could still be inspected and attacked by a malicious<br>&nbsp; client.&nbsp; We might consider giving guidance that ETag values should<br>&nbsp; be unpredictable.<br><br>- When the same information is present at multiple protocol layers<br>&nbsp; (e.g., the transport port number and the Host field value), in the<br>&nbsp; general case, attacks are possible if there is not check for<br>&nbsp; consistency of the values in the different layers.&nbsp; It's often helpful<br>&nbsp; to provide guidance on which entit(ies) should perform the check, to<br>&nbsp; avoid scenarios where all parties are expecting "someone else" to do<br>&nbsp; it.<br><br>- Relatedly, the port value is part of the https "origin" concept, but is not<br>&nbsp; authenticated by the certificate and could be modified (in the<br>&nbsp; transport layer) by an on-path attacker.&nbsp; The safety of per-origin<br>&nbsp; isolation relies on the server to check that the port intended by the<br>&nbsp; client matches the port the request was actually received on.<br><br>- We mention that in response to some 3xx redirection responses, a<br>&nbsp; client capable of link editing might do so automatically.&nbsp; Doing so<br>&nbsp; for http-not-s responses would allow for a form of privilege<br>&nbsp; escalation, converting even a temporary access into more permanent<br>&nbsp; changes on referring resources.<br><br>- We make heavy use of URIs and URI components; referencing the security<br>&nbsp; considerations of <a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC 3986</a> might be worthwhile<br><br>Section 17.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Unfortunately, communicating authority to users can be difficult.<br>&nbsp;  For example, _phishing_ is an attack on the user's perception of<br>&nbsp;  authority, where that perception can be misled by presenting similar<br>&nbsp;  branding in hypertext, possibly aided by userinfo obfuscating the<br>&nbsp;  authority component (see Section 4.2.1).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>We might also mention "confusable" domain names here as well (which are<br>possible even without resorting to IDNs).<br><br>Section 17.5<br><br>Should we also discuss situations where there might be redundant lengths<br>at different encoding layers (e.g., HTTP framing and MIME multipart<br>boundaries), in a similar vein to<br><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34#section-10.8">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-http-34#section-10.8</a><br>?<br><br>Section 17.16.3<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; well.&nbsp; The first revision of HTTP/1.1 added 307 (Temporary<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; Redirect) to indicate the former semantics of 302 without being<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

I was expecting some descriptions in this document on how the server push is realized specially using the methods defined in this document.<br><br>* Section 4.2.2:&nbsp; it says-<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The origin server for an "https" URI is identified by the authority<br>&nbsp;  component, which includes a host identifier and optional port number<br>&nbsp;  ([<a href="/doc/rfc3986/">RFC3986</a>], Section 3.2.2).&nbsp; If the port subcomponent is empty or not<br>given, TCP port 443 (the reserved port for HTTP over TLS) is the<br>&nbsp;  default.&nbsp; "<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how does this default work with HTTP/3 which used UDP port 443?<br><br>* It felt like security consideration section missing considerations for the TRACE method.&nbsp; The section 9.3.8 says - "A client MUST NOT generate fields in a TRACE request containing sensitive data" , I am just wondering is that good enough warning.<br><br>* I support Roman's comment about the strength of the recommendation based on the use of the verb “ought”. This might be a bit more confusing to the readers with non-native English language background. I would suggest to use more recommend or should or must in the entire document instead of "ought to".<br><br>* Lars provided very good input on editorial fixes/nits, I would skip mine and hope his will be addressed by the editors.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard; this is an update to previous standards-track documents (notably, <a href="/doc/rfc7230/">RFC 7230</a>). This status is indicated in the document and Datatracker.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document represents a revision and consolidation of the original RFCs produced by the HTTPbis working group, which defined HTTP in various documents published in 2014. This document encapsulates the version-independent semantics of HTTP, which is now more relevant to make clear after the advent of both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. This document is a critical reference for the work on HTTP/3 to rely upon.<br><br>Working Group Summary &amp; Document Quality:<br><br>The working group, led by the group of three editors, has poured a lot of time and effort into ensuring that these core documents are produced with great quality and clarity. This effort to revise the documents began in 2018, and over the past three years, the working group has spent about half of its meeting time discussing the ongoing work on these core documents. A detailed list of all issues that were discussed can be found on the GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues">https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues</a>.<br><br>While there were certainly manly points that required in-depth discussion, through WGLC, the process was guided by consensus, which was usually not rough.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Document Shepherd: Tommy Pauly<br>Responsible Area Director: Francesca Palombini<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I’ve reviewed this document as part of issuing the WGLC, and followed the various comments/issues filed by the WG and discussed in our recent interim meeting. I believe this document is quite ready to be forwarded, and is a truly useful and well-written specification.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No concerns. This document has been the product of careful and in-depth by the working group over several years, and went through a long last call.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No new reviews are needed here, in my opinion. This document isn’t introducing any new behavior or architecture, but rather consolidating and clarifying existing documents.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The editors have not indicated any IPR on this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR has been reported.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The WG consensus seems quite solid. During WGLC, we received in-depth reviews from core participants, as well as many GitHub issues from WG participants. From when WGLC started until now, we received 54 issues on the HTTP core documents from people other than document editors.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed</a><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard; this is an update to previous standards-track documents (notably, <a href="/doc/rfc7230/">RFC 7230</a>). This status is indicated in the document and Datatracker.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document represents a revision and consolidation of the original RFCs produced by the HTTPbis working group, which defined HTTP in various documents published in 2014. This document encapsulates the version-independent semantics of HTTP, which is now more relevant to make clear after the advent of both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. This document is a critical reference for the work on HTTP/3 to rely upon.<br><br>Working Group Summary &amp; Document Quality:<br><br>The working group, led by the group of three editors, has poured a lot of time and effort into ensuring that these core documents are produced with great quality and clarity. This effort to revise the documents began in 2018, and over the past three years, the working group has spent about half of its meeting time discussing the ongoing work on these core documents. A detailed list of all issues that were discussed can be found on the GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues">https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues</a>.<br><br>While there were certainly manly points that required in-depth discussion, through WGLC, the process was guided by consensus, which was usually not rough.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Document Shepherd: Tommy Pauly<br>Responsible Area Director: Francesca Palombini<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I’ve reviewed this document as part of issuing the WGLC, and followed the various comments/issues filed by the WG and discussed in our recent interim meeting. I believe this document is quite ready to be forwarded, and is a truly useful and well-written specification.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No concerns. This document has been the product of careful and in-depth by the working group over several years, and went through a long last call.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No new reviews are needed here, in my opinion. This document isn’t introducing any new behavior or architecture, but rather consolidating and clarifying existing documents.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The editors have not indicated any IPR on this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No IPR has been reported.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The WG consensus seems quite solid. During WGLC, we received in-depth reviews from core participants, as well as many GitHub issues from WG participants. From when WGLC started until now, we received 54 issues on the HTTP core documents from people other than document editors.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed</a><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.
