However, when saying this, you will need more text that discusses the operational side of this. For instance, it is not sufficient to blindly trust old data about the path's MTU between the initiator and the responder, as the characteristics of the path might have changed or the believe to use the same path as before is just wrong. <br><br>2) In Section 2.4, the second bullet list on page 6, bullet 1 and bullet 2:<br>This bullet assumes that the the way back from the responder to the initiator shares the same properties as the way forward from the initiator to the responder. I am not an IKE expert, but if the response is big, actually bigger than the PMTU on the way back, and the request was not fragmented, what happens in this case? <br>Bullet 2 is pointing ot this, but the current text is not very precis other than saying "has some knowledge". Further, bullet 2 contradicts bullet 1's SHOULD. <br><br>3) Section 2.5.2:<br>This section is hitting my main concern about not re-using <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a>'s mechnism.<br>For instance:<br>- You start from a large value and if this doesn't work you move to a smaller value. What is the recommended value for this and what steps do you take in decreasing the packet size? This sounds implementation specific, but implementers will value guidance on what to do. <br>- You talk about a timer that should be reasonable. What is reasonable?<br>- The text here worries me:<br>"After reaching the smallest allowed value for fragmentation threshold implementation MUST continue probing using it<br>until either exchange completes or times out."<br>So, you are continuesly probing the network though have rached your threshold and you still do not have success?<br><br>4) Section 2.6, page 11:<br>"If receiver doesn't get all IKE Fragment Messages needed to reassemble original Message for some Exchange within a timeout interval,". This draft isn't specifying any timeout value. See also my comment about interworking with any IKE timers.<br><br>5) Section 5, this text:<br>"To mitigate the impact of this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that<br>&nbsp;  receiver limits the number of fragments it stores in reassembling<br>&nbsp;  queue so that the sum of the sizes of Encrypted Fragment Payload<br>&nbsp;  contents (after decryption) for fragments that are already placed<br>&nbsp;  into reassembling queue be less than some value that is reasonable<br>&nbsp;  for the implementation. "<br><br>While buffer sizes are implementation specific, I do see this text as pure handwaiving, as it doesn't have any good guidance for implementers. I would add this as a comment, but if the number of fragments it stores in reassembling queue <br>is too small there is an interoperability issue, as the sender of the fragments cannot know what the acceptable lower limit is. Therefore this goes as an DISCUSS issue.<br><br><br>6)I can continue this list of open issues and questions, but instead let's ask the questions about why not re-using <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a>:<br><br>In <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a> there is text about what is required by the particular protocol in order to enable PLPMTUD, in Section 6.1.&nbsp; "Mechanism to Detect Loss" it says:<br><br>&nbsp;  "It is important that the Packetization Layer has a timely and robust<br>&nbsp;  mechanism for detecting and reporting losses."<br><br>Ok, I can see that UDP itself does not have this type of information built-in, but the rest of the document makes reasonable assumptions on how you can use PLPMTUD even without using TCP or SCTP. <br>For example, Section 10.4.&nbsp; "Probing Method Using Applications" even discusses doing PLPMTUD out of an application, which IKE is. <br><br>Please note that similar concerns where raised in Oct 2013 during the TSV-DIR review by Joe Touch and Matt Mathis.

However, when saying this, you will need more text that discusses the operational side of this. For instance, it is not sufficient to blindly trust old data about the path's MTU between the initiator and the responder, as the characteristics of the path might have changed or the believe to use the same path as before is just wrong. <br><br>2) In Section 2.4, the second bullet list on page 6, bullet 1 and bullet 2:<br>This bullet assumes that the the way back from the responder to the initiator shares the same properties as the way forward from the initiator to the responder. I am not an IKE expert, but if the response is big, actually bigger than the PMTU on the way back, and the request was not fragmented, what happens in this case? <br>Bullet 2 is pointing ot this, but the current text is not very precis other than saying "has some knowledge". Further, bullet 2 contradicts bullet 1's SHOULD. <br><br>3) Section 2.5.2:<br>This section is hitting my main concern about not re-using <a href="/doc/rfc4821/">RFC 4821</a>'s mechnism.<br>For instance:<br>- You start from a large value and if this doesn't work you move to a smaller value. What is the recommended value for this and what steps do you take in decreasing the packet size? This sounds implementation specific, but implementers will value guidance on what to do. <br>- You talk about a timer that should be reasonable. What is reasonable?<br>- The text here worries me:<br>"After reaching the smallest allowed value for fragmentation threshold implementation MUST continue probing using it<br>until either exchange completes or times out."<br>So, you are continuesly probing the network though have rached your threshold and you still do not have success?<br><br>4) Section 2.6, page 11:<br>"If receiver doesn't get all IKE Fragment Messages needed to reassemble original Message for some Exchange within a timeout interval,". This draft isn't specifying any timeout value. See also my comment about interworking with any IKE timers.<br><br>5) Section 5, this text:<br>"To mitigate the impact of this attack, it is RECOMMENDED that<br>&nbsp;  receiver limits the number of fragments it stores in reassembling<br>&nbsp;  queue so that the sum of the sizes of Encrypted Fragment Payload<br>&nbsp;  contents (after decryption) for fragments that are already placed<br>&nbsp;  into reassembling queue be less than some value that is reasonable<br>&nbsp;  for the implementation. "<br><br>While buffer sizes are implementation specific, I do see this text as pure handwaiving, as it doesn't have any good guidance for implementers. I would add this as a comment, but if the number of fragments it stores in reassembling queue <br>is too small there is an interoperability issue, as the sender of the fragments cannot know what the acceptable lower limit is.

Even leaving aside the grammatical issues, which makes some of this section confusing, as written I think this section is actually self-contradictory: The opening paragraph indicates that the initiator is free to fragment (or not) completely at its discretion, but then the bullets indicate that there are interoperability requirements with fragmenting that do not agree with that. My guess is that all of the SHOULDs and SHOULD NOTs in 2.4 are actually just suggestions, but honestly I can't be sure: None of them explain why it's problematic to deviate from them, so I can't tell if they're actually indicating interoperability or security problems or are simply implementation advice.

NATs dropping IP fragments is called out in Section 3 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3424">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3424</a>, published in 2002, and I don't think that was a new thing then.

I'm guessing that the answer would be "if the path MTU is so small that you can't send IKE Fragment Messages without IP fragmentation also occurs, don't bother doing IKE fragmentation", but I'm wondering if you could make an explicit recommendation about that?<br><br>In this text, in Section 4.&nbsp; Transport Considerations<br><br>&nbsp;  With IKE Fragmentation if any single IKE Fragment Message get lost,<br>&nbsp;  receiver becomes unable to reassemble original Message.&nbsp; So, in<br>&nbsp;  general, using IKE Fragmentation implies higher probability for the<br>&nbsp;  Message not to be delivered to the peer.&nbsp; Although in most network<br>&nbsp;  environments the difference will be insignificant, on some lossy<br>&nbsp;  networks it may become noticeable.&nbsp; When using IKE Fragmentation<br>&nbsp;  implementations MAY use longer timeouts and do more retransmits<br>&nbsp;  before considering peer dead.<br><br>I don't understand.
