The first<br>reference is in 3.7 on p13, which just seems wrong.&nbsp; If this<br>is somehow inspired by BT (can't recall) then maybe say so and<br>add a quick sketch (2-3 sentences) on how this differs from<br>BT. Those would really help the reader IMO.&nbsp; Note that this<br>could be done by reference.<br><br>- 1.1: I really dislike the term self-certification as its<br>quite misleading. I guess its probably too late to get rid of<br>that but what (I think) is going on here is really naming<br>chunks so that if you know the hash of the entire content you<br>can verify that the chunk is from that.&nbsp; (CHECK!!!)<br><br>- 1.3, 'content': s/asset/file/ would be better I think and<br>less capitalist;-) The term asset is odd here anyway.&nbsp; Same<br>elsewhere. (But note this is really nitty, no need to change<br>unless you want to.)<br><br>- 3: I don't get what is meant by this "an external storage<br>mapping from the linear byte space of a single swarm to<br>different files" I can sorta see what's meant, but am not<br>sure. Maybe try clarify?<br><br>- 5.3, last para: Is the 1st MUST there really implementable<br>in general? I think the MUST might be to include those hashes<br>that the sender thinks the receiver needs.<br><br>- 6.1 - this defines two methods yet says "If the protocol<br>operates in a benign environment the method MAY be used."<br>Which is meant here?<br><br>- 6.1.2.1: what if different folks think NCHUNKS_PER_SIG has<br>different values? How do we all agree on a value? (BTW, the<br>last sentence of this section is a cool thing.)<br><br>- 7.4: "In other cases a peer MAY include a swarm identifier<br>option, as an end-to-end check." That's not clear to me, what<br>other cases?<br><br>- 7.6: I don't get why you need so many options here. Do you<br>really?&nbsp; SHA1 is probably only needed for legacy stuff (is<br>there any of that?), and SHA256 should be fine for everything<br>else. <br><br>- 7.8: The width of the figure seems wrong.<br><br>- 7.10: An example compressed encoding would be useful.<br><br>- 8.16: "perfectly detected" - huh? what does that mean?</div></td>

Today that means SHA256<br>and not SHA1.&nbsp; <br><br>(4) 7.7: Why RSASHA1 and not RSA with SHA256?<br><br>(5) 7.10: The message number is wrong in the figure.<br><br>(6) 8.4: I don't see the swarm's metadata record in the ascii<br>art diagram and you just say "look at section 7" so two<br>questions: a) where is the "chunk size used" option in section<br>7? and b) do all the swarm metadata options have to be sent<br>each time with no limit on ordering except as given in section<br>7 (which had one such order sensitive limit I think)?<br><br>(7) 8.13: Don't you need to register the ppsp URI scheme? In<br>case its useful, which I doubt, if you have code: <a href="/doc/rfc6920/">RFC6920</a> URIs<br>could be used for this if you wanted and would save you adding<br>ppsp to the IANA URI scheme registry (and having to deal with<br>the URI police:-) <br><br>(8) 13.4: Wouldn't DTLS change the chunk size considerations<br>and also influence how messages map to datagrams? Isn't more<br>specification needed to say how to really use DTLS here? Just<br>saying "use DTLS or IPsec or higher layer crypto" doesn't<br>really seem sufficient. And doing the DTLS bits right<br>shouldn't be very hard either.</div></td>

The first<br>reference is in 3.7 on p13, which just seems wrong.&nbsp; If this<br>is somehow inspired by BT (can't recall) then maybe say so and<br>add a quick sketch (2-3 sentences) on how this differs from<br>BT. Those would really help the reader IMO.&nbsp; Note that this<br>could be done by reference.<br><br>- 1.1: I really dislike the term self-certification as its<br>quite misleading. I guess its probably too late to get rid of<br>that but what (I think) is going on here is really naming<br>chunks so that if you know the hash of the entire content you<br>can verify that the chunk is from that.&nbsp; (CHECK!!!)<br><br>- 1.3, 'content': s/asset/file/ would be better I think and<br>less capitalist;-) The term asset is odd here anyway.&nbsp; Same<br>elsewhere.

If the bottleneck is near the recipient, then every sender sending chunks will yield early, and there may be no senders available to stream at an acceptable level of quality.

In a quick scan, the only other instances of "error" are "ICMP error", so maybe you don't need a qualifier at all?<br><br>In this text: <br><br>3.1.&nbsp; HANDSHAKE<br><br>&nbsp;  After the handshakes are exchanged, the initiator knows that the peer<br>&nbsp;  really responds.&nbsp; Hence, the second datagram the initiator sends MAY<br>&nbsp;  already contain some heavy payload, e.g.&nbsp; DATA messages.&nbsp; To minimize<br>&nbsp;  the number of initialization round-trips, the first two datagrams<br>&nbsp;  exchanged MAY also contain some minor payload, e.g.&nbsp; HAVE messages to<br>&nbsp;  indicate the current progress of a peer or a REQUEST (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.7), but MUST NOT include any DATA message.<br><br>This was difficult for me to parse, and the words "heavy" and "minor" didn't help me understand. Is this saying something like "Peers don't include DATA messages in payloads they send unless they've akwa successfully exchanged messages"? If that's not what's meant, is there a list of "heavy" and "monor" messages? (Obviously, I don't think the MAYs are 2119 MAYs because they are so imprecise, but that's another story)<br><br>I should also mention that "heavy" appears 10 times in the specification, and I don't think it's ever defined. Is this a term famliar with those schooled in the art?<br><br>In this text: <br><br>3.2.&nbsp; HAVE<br><br>&nbsp;  In particular, whenever a receiving peer P has successfully checked<br>&nbsp;  the integrity of a chunk, or interval of chunks, it SHOULD send a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ^^^^^^<br><br>&nbsp;  HAVE message to all peers Q1..Qn it wants to interact with in the<br>&nbsp;  near future.&nbsp; A policy in peer P determines when the HAVE is sent.&nbsp; P<br>&nbsp;  may sent it directly, or peer P may wait until either it has other<br>&nbsp;  data to sent to Qi, or until it has received and checked multiple<br>&nbsp;  chunks.&nbsp; <br><br>This wasn't clear to me. I'm not understanding why a SHOULD is appropriate, but I suspect I shouldn't be askig a 2119 question, because this is tangled between "send a HAVE to the peers you want to interact with in the near future" and "if you don't want to interact with a specific peer in the near future, you can wait to send a HAVE". Is that even close?<br><br>In this text: <br><br>3.4.&nbsp; ACK<br><br>&nbsp;  ACK messages MUST be sent to acknowledge received chunks if PPSPP is<br>&nbsp;  run over an unreliable transport protocol.&nbsp; ACK messages MAY be sent<br>&nbsp;  if a reliable transport protocol is used.&nbsp; In the former case, a<br>&nbsp;  receiving peer that has successfully checked the integrity of a<br>&nbsp;  chunk, or interval of chunks C MUST send an ACK message containing a<br>&nbsp;  chunk specification for C. As LEDBAT is used, an ACK message MUST<br>&nbsp;  contain the one-way delay, computed from the peer's current system<br>&nbsp;  time received in the DATA message.&nbsp; A peer MAY delay sending ACK<br>&nbsp;  messages as defined in the LEDBAT specification.<br><br>(I emphasize that this is a question, not even a comment) How hard did the working group fight to pick a single style of transport protocol for PPSPP, rather than support multiple styles that don't use the same state machine? If that decision got good discussion, fine, but I wanted to ask because support for both reliable and ureliable transport adds complexity, and I've seen working groups that tried to do transport-independent protocols only because they thought that's what the ADs expected.<br><br>In this text:<br><br>5.3.&nbsp; The Atomic Datagram Principle<br><br>&nbsp;  As explained above, a datagram consists of a sequence of messages.<br>&nbsp;  Ideally, every datagram sent must be independent of other datagrams,<br>&nbsp;  so each datagram SHOULD be processed separately and a loss of one<br>&nbsp;  datagram must not disrupt the flow of datagrams between two peers.<br>&nbsp;  Thus, as a datagram carries zero or more messages, neither messages<br>&nbsp;  nor message interdependencies SHOULD span over multiple datagrams.<br><br>&nbsp;  This principle implies that as any chunk is verified using its uncle<br>&nbsp;  hashes the necessary hashes SHOULD be put into the same datagram as<br>&nbsp;  the chunk's data.&nbsp; If this is not possible because of a limitation on<br>&nbsp;  datagram size, the necessary hashes MUST be sent first in one or more<br>&nbsp;  datagrams.&nbsp; As a general rule, if some additional data is still<br>&nbsp;  missing to process a message within a datagram, the message SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  dropped.<br><br>With that many SHOULDs, I'd be worried that implementations using PPSPP can't count on much. If I receive a message that spans multiple datagrams (even though it shouldn't), that don't include the necessary hashes (even though it should), and I don't drop a message with missing data (even though I should), is that all fine?<br><br>In this text:<br><br>5.4.&nbsp; INTEGRITY Messages<br><br>&nbsp;  Concretely, a peer that wants to send a chunk of content creates a<br>&nbsp;  datagram that MUST consist of a list of INTEGRITY messages followed<br>&nbsp;  by a DATA message.&nbsp; If the INTEGRITY messages and DATA message cannot<br>&nbsp;  be put into a single datagram because of a limitation on datagram<br>&nbsp;  size, the INTEGRITY messages MUST be sent first in one or more<br>&nbsp;  datagrams.&nbsp; <br><br>Is this assuming that the path between peers will never reorder packets?</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>RFC Type: Proposed Standard.<br>This is a protocol specification document. RFC type is indicated in the title page header.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>Relevant content can frequently be found in the abstract and/or introduction of the document. If not, this may be an indication that there are deficiencies in the abstract or introduction. <br><br>The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a protocol for disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a streaming fashion. PPSPP supports streaming of both pre-recorded (on-demand) and live audio/video content. It is based on the peer-to-peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are put on equal footing with the servers initially providing the content, to create a system where everyone can potentially provide upload bandwidth. It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user, and to prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers. PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and extensible. It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables). It supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk addressing. Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top of various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP suing LEDBAT for congestion control.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>There were several issues raised during WGLC; however, none were particularly rough and authors came up with the text that resolves these issues thus consensus was achieved in all cases. After that, some technical comments were made during the AD review and all were addressed with consensus.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>This draft has some implementations and evaluations in the lab. It is expected that with the approval of this document the number of implementations will increase. During the WGLC, this draft has been deep reviewed by Riccardo Bernardini and Yunfei Zhang. The issues of protocol versioning and guideline absence on when to declare a peer dead are addressed.&nbsp; The AD found some high level issues which have been already solved. One issue is that PPSPP as a Standards Track protocol cannot normatively rely on LEDBAT which is an Experimental congestion control mechanism. The problem is solved by having measurements and deployment results that show the widespread use of LEDBAT in current P2P systems and towards a DOWNREF procedure. <br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Document Shepherd: Rachel Huang<br>Responsible AD: Martin Stiemerling<br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>As the Document Shepherd, I have carefully reviewed the version 09 being forwarded to IESG. In my opinion, it accurately reflects the consensus of the working group and is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>The document has been reviewed by a number of knowledgeable participants within the PPSP WG. I don’t have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the review. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>This document has a security consideration chapter and a management consideration chapter. So particular reviews regarding security and operation complexity are required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no such issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>As Document Shepherd, I have confirmed that the authors are not personally aware of any IPR related to this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The WG as a whole understand and agree with the document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>No ID nits found.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>No further formal review required except for a thorough review by IANA which will be conducted anyway.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br> <br>No.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,&nbsp; that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>). <br><br>The IANA Considerations section is correct and adequate. It creates 6 new IANA registries which all include detailed specification of the initial content for registry. Each of these new registries has a reasonable name.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>This document creates 6 new IANA registries. Each of them should be carefully reviewed for future allocations by IANA experts.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>No such formal language is used in this document.<br><br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>From the Abstract section of the draft:<br>The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a transport protocol for disseminating the same content to a group of interested parties in a streaming fashion.&nbsp; PPSPP supports streaming of both pre-recorded (on-demand) and live audio/video content.&nbsp; It is based on the peer-to-peer paradigm, where clients consuming the content are put on equal footing with the servers initially providing the content, to create a system where everyone can potentially provide upload bandwidth.&nbsp; It has been designed to provide short time-till-playback for the end user and to prevent disruption of the streams by malicious peers.&nbsp; PPSPP has also been designed to be flexible and extensible.&nbsp; It can use different mechanisms to optimize peer uploading, prevent free riding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables).&nbsp; It supports multiple methods for content integrity protection and chunk addressing.&nbsp; Designed as a generic protocol that can run on top on various transport protocols, it currently runs on top of UDP using LEDBAT for congestion control.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>We are at version -06 of the document. One of the main topics that the WG has discussed is related to the addressing of the chunks. After a round of discussions the WG agreed on the latest proposal and a very large WG consensus has been reached. During WG last call period the WG raised a few minor issues that have been fixed and incorporated to the last version of the document.<br>In addition, and after AD review, the authors improved substantially the Operation and Management section in order to reflect the requirements expressed in draft-ietf-ppsp-problem-statement. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br>We have one implementation of the PPSP Peer Protocol that has been demonstrated during the IETF-84 and IETF-85 meetings.<br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br>Not at this stage.<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues?<br>Yunfei Zhang (WG co-chair) and Martin Stiemerling (AD).<br>If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br>Stefano Previdi<br>Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br>Martin Stiemerling<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>In addition to the WG review, an in depth review has been done by the Document Shepherd and with help of the Responsible Area Director.<br>Review has pointed out mostly:<br> . editorial aspect of the draft content.<br> . Addition of a Operation and Management section<br> . Addition of a IANA Consideration section<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br>No. In depth review has been consistently done by the WG. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br>Despite the effort of all reviewers, we don’t think any native-English speaker/reader/writer person has reviewed the draft from an editorial perspective.<br>Security and Operation&amp;Management sections have been reviewed but probably needs expert review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br>Since no English-native speaker/writer has reviewed the document we may have missed editorial/grammar typo’s. <br><br> (7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Yes. All authors confirmed IPR disclosure status (i.e.: no IPR exists).<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br>A substantial amount of people explicitly expressed their support to this document so we can say that we have a large and active WG consensus.&nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.
