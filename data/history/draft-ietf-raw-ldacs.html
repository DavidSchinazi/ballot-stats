However, it felt a bit short on the purpose of such a documentation about LDACS and FCI description. <br><br>I was trying to see how much of this document is actually leading to usecase / requirements and how much of it just description of something done outside of IETF. I concluded that this merely a description of other related technology which might be using RAW. I see that is what the shepherd also wrote. Hence, I find it as support material and in that category we are supposed to encourage the WG to use other tools to publish something which does not have archiving values. A simple reference to the LDAC spec or something in appendix or use of WG wiki could serve the purpose and save WG's time and energy.More than that I found this is below layer-3 and to me that seems to be out of scope of RAW.<br><br>It might be the way the document is written where the scope and intention is not clear from the document itself. yes, this might be good information for RAW work, but may be it should then focus on those part which are relevant and need a IETF consensus to really agree on those relevant parts to work in RAW.<br><br>For this I am supporting Roman's and Alvero's discuss.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>-&gt; Informational. The document illustrates that LDACS has the properties that are needed to support RAW but RAW doesn’t place any special&nbsp; requirement that would require normative text. In fact, RAW is not even chartered to specify anything so far and produces only informational documents. See also my WG summary below.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document provides an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which is a wireless communication standard defined outside of the IETF and relevant to the work at the RAW WG. <br>LDACS provides a secure, scalable and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation, based on a scheduled, reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6. <br>It is expected to become a data link of choice for IP network-based aircraft guidance for which the RAW properties of high reliability and availability are essential.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The process was as smooth as possible, with no contradiction over the ML or during meetings. The document is really the description by matter specialists of an externally-defined link-layer. It is a useful base for the RAW work and good information for the rest of us.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>LDACS is an emerging technology; prototypes were presented, see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397802">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397802</a>. The draft was written by the technology specialists. It is very readable and quite thorough. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Pascal Thubert <br>Responsible Area Director: John Scudder<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd performed a full review of the documents and the comments were addressed. No major issue reported. The document appears ready for publication request.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>Not at all!<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It would be cool that the security model in their Tesla mechanism be validated; but then again this is not an IETF-defined standard.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No such thing<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, they all confirmed; there is no IPR to report on that document; there might be IPR on the presented technology.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No disclosure<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The former; it’s a good read but not a standard being developed in-house.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No such thing<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>Nothing worth mentioning; an unused reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> will be removed<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>No such need<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>Only RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>None<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA request<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>No such need<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br>&nbsp;  This document provides an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which is a wireless communication standard defined outside of the IETF and relevant to the work at the RAW WG. LDACS provides a secure, scalable and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation.&nbsp; LDACS is a scheduled, reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6, providing a data link for IP network-based aircraft guidance for which the RAW properties of High reliability and availability are essential.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The process was as smooth as possible, with no contradiction over the ML or during meetings. The document is really the description by matter specialists of an externally-defined link-layer. It is a useful base for the RAW work and good information for the rest of us.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>LDACS is an emerging technology; prototypes were presented, see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397802">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397802</a>. The draft was written by the technology specialists. It is very readable and quite thorough. <br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Pascal Thubert <br>Responsible Area Director: John Scudder<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The shepherd performed a full review of the documents and the comments were addressed. No major issue reported. The document appears ready for publication request.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>Not at all!<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>It would be cool that the security model in their Tesla mechanism be validated; but then again this is not an IETF-defined standard.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No such thing<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, they all confirmed; there is no IPR to report on that document; there might be IPR on the presented technology.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No disclosure<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>The former; it’s a good read but not a standard being developed in-house.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No such thing<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>Nothing worth mentioning; an unused reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> will be removed<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>No such need<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>Only RFCs<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>None<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>No IANA request<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations.
