If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Document Shepherd reviewed this Internet Draft on 28 January 2021 and submitted detailed comments to the author at that time.&nbsp; The Document Shepherd subsequently reviewed a revised edition of the draft on6 July 2021.&nbsp; The draft is now ready for publication. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No, reviews of the document have been performed both by persons with good understanding of Bundle Security Protocol and by persons with good understanding of network security.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The document was reviewed in detail by the Security Area Directorate in March-April of 2021 and comments were addressed in revised editions of the draft. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of. For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns or issues with this document.&nbsp; Technical questions have been discussed at length and resolved by consensus within the WG.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors have stated that they do not claim any intellectual property rights regarding this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No claims of intellectual property rights regarding this document have been stated.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>It is the sense of the WG Chairs and the Document Shepherd that this document represents the consensus of the WG.&nbsp; Most WG members have limited expertise in the subject matter of the document, so only a small number of WG members have been active in discussions of the default BPSec security contexts. However, the WG as a whole understands the intent of the document and, broadly, the decisions that are fundamental to it, and there is no audible dissent at the WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No discontent pertaining to the default BPSec security contexts has been evident in the WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document.

If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The Internet Drafts for Bundle Protocol Version 7 and Bundle Protocol Security Specification are referenced.&nbsp; Those documents have been approved by IESG and are now in the RFC Editor’s queue. <br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references in the document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>Publication of this document will not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>Allocation of two additional entries in the BPSec Security Context Identifiers Registry is noted appropriately.&nbsp; Two new IANA registries are required: Integrity Scope Flags and AAD Scope Flags.&nbsp; In both cases, registration policies and detailed initial contents are provided.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>The registration policies for both new IANA registries are “Specification Required”. <br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>No sections of the BPSec default security contexts specification are written in any formal language.<br><br></div></td>

I'm really glad that it will be<br>available to illuminate the particulars of BPsec usage and provide a<br>default option when running BPsec in relatively bland environments.<br>However, I think there are a few gaps between the current specification<br>and a strong/reliable default security option.<br><br>(D1) the construction for the HMAC input plaintext and GCM AAD seems to<br>be "malleable" at the security context layer.&nbsp; That is, in order for the<br>cryptographic integrity protection mechanism to provide strong<br>guarantees for the application protocol's semantics, the mapping from<br>protocol parameters (e.g., "security target contents", "primary block")<br>to the actual byte string used as the IPPT/AAD inputs to HMAC/GMAC needs<br>to be an injective mapping (in the mathematical sense).&nbsp; If injectivity<br>does not hold, then there is more than one possible application<br>semantics that could be perceived as valid upon successful validation of<br>the authentication tag at the recipient; this "malleability" across<br>different interpretations of the bytes covered by a given integrity tag<br>gives an opening by which an attacker can target the application<br>semantics.<br><br>The current construction seems<br>"malleable" because the scope flags are not protected in any way and<br>could be modified by an attacker, and the scope flags affect which<br>application protocol fields (and thus, semantics) are used to construct<br>the IPPT/AAD.&nbsp; If the attacker modifies the messages to move those<br>encoded bytes from one location to another, the modified message could<br>still pass cryptographic verification but be interpreted with different<br>semantics than intended.&nbsp; We do correctly note that the security context<br>identifier and the security context parameters of the security block are<br>not included in the input data, but the conclusion that "successful<br>verification implies that these parameters were unchanged from what the<br>security source has specified" does not seem entirely warranted without<br>further analysis that relies on the internal structure of the different<br>potential parts of the IPPT/AAD.<br><br>[side note: the IETF security community tends towards "always include as<br>much information in the MAC as you can without breaking operations",<br>which would naively be everything included with scope flags 0x7.&nbsp; Always<br>including everything removes the malleability, since there are no gaps<br>to move around.&nbsp; But I think I can come up with scenarios where this<br>flexibility would indeed be needed in BP operations, so my tentative<br>conclusion is that the simple "always MAC everything" approach will not<br>work here.]<br><br>Specifically, to the extent that we may have injectivity, we seem to be<br>relying on the specific encoding details of the different types of<br>information that could be used in constructing the IPPT and AAD.&nbsp; Since<br>the IPPT/AAD is currently just the concatenation (in a particular order)<br>of any/all of a few pieces of data, we can only get injectivity if each<br>of those pieces of data is self-framing and *self-identifying* by its<br>encoded form.&nbsp; (If we, for example, prefixed each self-framing part with<br>a type identifier for what followed, that would make the overall<br>encoding self-identifying for what is contained therein.)&nbsp; E.g., the<br>primary block is going to be a CBOR array with (at least?) 8 elements,<br>starting with 0x0808, and is self-framing by virtue of being a CBOR<br>object.&nbsp; But the "security target other fields" are not so clearly self<br>framing, as it's more of a CBOR sequence with type code, block number,<br>and control flags as three unsigned integers; we have to know a priori<br>to read three CBOR unsigned integers and treat that as a single object.<br>Furthermore, the "BIB other fields" (or "BCB other fields") are also<br>three CBOR unsigned integers, and since it's possible for (e.g.) a BIB<br>to be the security target of a BIB, the block type code cannot<br>distinguish between a security target and the BIB information.&nbsp; Only the<br>block number could, but IIRC the block number itself is malleable to an<br>on-path attacker.&nbsp; And this analysis only covers the currently specified<br>scope flags; any future additions might add new ways for injectivity to<br>fail.&nbsp; It's much better to have a strong injective construction at the<br>higher layer and not rely on the internal encoding details of the<br>component pieces.<br><br>So, I think we need to include at least the scope flags as part of the<br>IPPT/AAD in order to provide injectivity.&nbsp; It might be worth considering<br>adding additional framing and typing to make clear boundaries between<br>the different parts of the IPPT/AAD, but my current understanding is<br>that it would not be strictly necessary to do so.<br><br>(D2) There seems to be some risk associated with the current HMAC<br>construction, since the HMAC with a given key over a given plaintext<br>will be the same each time it is calculated.&nbsp; In other protocol<br>contexts, this has led to practical attacks and HMAC forgery, by using a<br>side-channel to gain insight into the verifier's behavior and guessing<br>the correct HMAC tag for a given (attacker-selected) plaintext a byte at<br>a time.&nbsp; With only a modest number of trials (4k on average for<br>HMAC-SHA-256, assuming a fully reliable side channel) this would let the<br>attacker extract the valid HMAC tag that the verifier produced for<br>comparison against the attacker's guess at the HMAC tag.&nbsp; Since this is<br>the HMAC tag over the attacker's chosen plaintext, this lets the<br>attacker obtain a valid HMAC tag without knowing the HMAC key.<br><br>Now, it seems clear that in the preponderance of BP deployments there<br>will not be an effective side channel available!&nbsp; But IMO this still<br>reflects a fundamental cryptographic weakness in the protocol and we<br>should make some effort to address it.&nbsp; There are a couple potential<br>mitigation approaches off the top of my head, which can be combined if<br>desired: include a nonce as part of the HMAC input (and encourage<br>rejection of reused nonces), and require constant-time comparison of the<br>supplied and expected authentication tag (to prevent using a side<br>channel from reading it off byte by byte).&nbsp; I suspect that there may be some<br>operational issues with the "unique nonce per HMAC" approach that would<br>make it not terribly reliable in practice, but "use a constant-time<br>comparison" should be fairly straightforward.<br><br>(D3) While we do provide the standard guidance against using any given<br>key with more than one algorithm (e.g., with HMAC-SHA-256 and<br>AES256-GCM), there seem to be additional considerations relevant to this<br>protocol that merit further discussion in the security considerations.<br>Specifically, we make provision for an AES-KW wrapped key to be included<br>along with the security payload and mandate that if present, such a key<br>be used.&nbsp; Given that the parameter holding the wrapped key does not seem<br>to be bound to a given message, it seems fairly straightforward for an<br>in-network attacker to "slice and dice" the ciphertext and wrapped key<br>away from each other, and cause any wrapped key it has seen to be<br>attempted to be used with a given algorithm+ciphertext.&nbsp; This, in turn,<br>would provide attacker-induced key reuse across algorithms, which is<br>something that we want to avoid.&nbsp; While providing full protection<br>against key reuse with different algorithms would prove fairly<br>challenging and probably require significant state on the<br>verifier/security destination, we should at least have some discussion<br>of the situation, and could provide some modest mitigation techniques<br>such as using distinct KEKs for receiving wrapped keys that have different<br>intended usage.&nbsp; That is, one KEK for receiving AES keys, another for<br>HMAC keys, etc..&nbsp; Attaching context (intended algorithm, etc.) to the<br>KEK allows such context to be indirectly attached to the received<br>wrapped keys, which otherwise would come without much context for<br>intended usage.</div></td>

I also have some non blocking comments, which I hope will help improve the document.<br><br>Francesca<br><br>1. -----<br><br>FP: I agree with my colleagues that extensibility should be considered for algorithms. This document defines BIB-HMAC-SHA2 and BCB-AES-GCM, with the algorithms these security contexts provide. Adding support for one algorithm would need to define a new security context. Wouldn't it make sense to, instead, provide a way to add algorithms to the existing algorithms? For example, defining an IANA registry for each security context with the IDs of algorithms supported (taken from COSE).<br><br>2. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Bit 2 (0x0003): Security Header Flag.<br><br>FP: This should be (0x0004) and not (0x0003) (and same in a later section). Also, this is not wrong, but the bitmaps (here and everywhere else) could also be represented as 0b0100 in CBOR diagnostic notation, which to me is clearer.<br><br>3. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Bits 8-15 are unassigned.<br><br>FP: I am wondering why the limit on Bit 15, marked as unassigned: I think it would make sense to say Bits 8 and higher are unassigned. (This change would need to be reflected in the IANA sections)<br><br>4. -----<br><br>FP: this might be me missing some fundamental reading from bpsec, but I see that the blocks are defined as CBOR sequences. However, that is only mentioned in the appendix (meant to be informative):<br><br>&nbsp;  represented using CBOR structures.&nbsp; In cases where BP blocks (to<br>&nbsp;  include BPSec security blocks) are comprised of a sequence of CBOR<br>&nbsp;  objects, these objects are represented as a CBOR sequence as defined<br>&nbsp;  in [<a href="/doc/rfc8742/">RFC8742</a>].<br><br>Is this defined somewhere else? If yes, could you add a pointer to the doc where it is defined? If not, this should be clarified, and specified earlier in the text, say in sections 3 and 4.<br><br>5. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  [1, b'Twelve121212'] / Initialization Vector /,<br><br>FP: I think the IV value is wrong here and should be h'5477656c7665313231323132'.</div></td>

I got a bit confused by the formulation, but please correct me if this is anything else than just the value extracted from the CBOR encoding.<br><br>17. -----<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The IV selected MUST be of the appropriate length.&nbsp; Because<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; replaying an IV in counter mode voids the confidentiality of all<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; messages encrypted with said IV, this context also requires a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unique IV for every encryption performed with the same key.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; means the same key and IV combination MUST NOT be used more than<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once.<br><br>FP: This makes me uncomfortable, as I would like to see more indications on how the IV uniqueness is achieved. Also, there should be mention of the failure to provide IV uniqueness in the security considerations.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, <br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Document Shepherd reviewed this Internet Draft on 28 January 2021 and <br>submitted detailed comments to the author at that time.&nbsp; The draft is now ready <br>for publication. <br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No, reviews of the document have been performed both by persons with good <br>understanding of Bundle Security Protocol and by persons with good understanding <br>of network security.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The document would benefit from additional review from the Security area. <br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has <br>with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be <br>aware of. For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of <br>the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any <br>event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still <br>wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns or issues with this document.&nbsp; <br>Technical questions have been discussed at length and resolved by consensus <br>within the WG.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>already been filed.

If so, <br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No claims of intellectual property rights regarding this document have been <br>stated.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br> WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>It is the sense of the WG Chairs and the Document Shepherd that this document <br>represents the consensus of the WG.&nbsp; Most WG members have limited expertise in <br>the subject matter of the document, so only a small number of WG members have <br>been active in discussions of the default BPSec security contexts. However, <br>the WG as a whole understands the intent of the document and, broadly, the <br>decisions that are fundamental to it, and there is no audible dissent at the <br>WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this <br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No discontent pertaining to the default BPSec security contexts has been evident <br>in the WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. <br>(See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist).<br>Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>The idnits tool finds no errors or flaws in the document and issues no warnings.<br>In reference to the Internet-Drafts Checklist:<br>•	No new URLs, email lists, or email aliases are required.<br>•	The Document Shepherd has found no other ID nits.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such <br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal review criteria are known to be applicable. <br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either <br>normative or informative?<br><br>Yes, all references have been identified as normative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for <br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references <br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The Internet Drafts for Bundle Protocol Version 7 and Bundle Protocol Security <br>Specification are referenced.&nbsp; Those documents have been approved by IESG and <br>are now in the RFC Editor’s queue. <br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these <br>downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references in the document.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and <br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and <br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the <br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this <br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>Publication of this document will not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, <br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm <br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the <br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA <br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA <br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the <br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and <br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>No new IANA registries are required.&nbsp; Allocation of two additional entries in <br>the BPSec Security Context Identifiers Registry is noted appropriately.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future <br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in <br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>No new IANA registries are required. <br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd <br>to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML <br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>No sections of the BPSec default security contexts specification are written <br>in any formal language.<br></div></td>

Why is this <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; header?<br><br>A Proposed Standard is being requested.&nbsp; The title page header indicates that <br>the intended status is Standards Track, and the specification documented in <br>the current Internet Draft is not yet mature enough to qualify as an Internet <br>Standard.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. <br>Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be <br>found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval <br>announcement contains the following sections: <br><br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>This document defines default integrity and confidentiality security<br>contexts that may be used with implementations of the Bundle Protocol<br>Security Protocol (BPSec).&nbsp; These security contexts may be used for<br>both testing the interoperability of BPSec implementations and for<br>providing basic security operations when no other security contexts<br>are defined or otherwise required for a network.<br><br>The Bundle Protocol Security Protocol (BPSec) [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpsec/">I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec</a>]<br>specification defines bundle integrity and confidentiality<br>operations for networks deploying the Bundle Protocol (BP)<br>[<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis/">I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis</a>]. BPSec defines BP extension blocks to carry<br>security information produced under the auspices of one or more<br>security contexts.<br><br>This document defines two security contexts (one for an integrity<br>service and one for a confidentiality service) for populating BPSec<br>Block Integrity Blocks (BIBs) and Block Confidentiality Blocks<br>(BCBs). <br><br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>The present document is the product of one year of active disussion on<br>the DTN WG mailing list, beginning with questions raised by Area Directors<br>during the initial IESG review of the BPSec specification in early 2020.<br>In particular, it was noted that a published default security context<br>would be required for interoperation among BPSec implementations, both<br>for conformance testing and also for operational use under some circumstances.<br>Constraints on this interoperability security context emerged from productive<br>email exhanges over recent months, and at this point no aspects of the<br>specification are controversial.&nbsp; The present document is cited as a normative<br>reference in the BPSec specification.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Document Quality<br><br>No implementations of the default BPSec security context are known to exist<br>yet.&nbsp; Significant issues were identified by Mehmet Adalier (Antara Teknik)<br>during Working Group Last Call; these issues were addressed in<br>draft-ietf-dtn-bpsec-default-sc-01.&nbsp; It is the sense of the Working Group<br>that the document has no serious problems.&nbsp; <br><br><br>Personnel<br><br>The Document Shepherd is Scott Burleigh.<br>The Responsible Area Director is Magnus Westerlund.<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the <br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, <br>please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br><br>The Document Shepherd reviewed this Internet Draft on 28 January 2021 and <br>submitted detailed comments to the author at that time.&nbsp; The draft is now ready <br>for publication. <br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of <br>the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>No, reviews of the document have been performed both by persons with good <br>understanding of Bundle Security Protocol and by persons with good understanding <br>of network security.<br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader <br>perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or <br>internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>The document would benefit from additional review from the Security area. <br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has <br>with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be <br>aware of. For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of <br>the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any <br>event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still <br>wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>The Document Shepherd has no specific concerns or issues with this document.&nbsp; <br>Technical questions have been discussed at length and resolved by consensus <br>within the WG.<br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures <br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have <br>already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The author has stated that he does not claim any intellectual property rights <br>regarding this document.<br><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, <br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>No claims of intellectual property rights regarding this document have been <br>stated.<br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the <br>strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the<br> WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>It is the sense of the WG Chairs and the Document Shepherd that this document <br>represents the consensus of the WG.&nbsp; Most WG members have limited expertise in <br>the subject matter of the document, so only a small number of WG members have <br>been active in discussions of the default BPSec security contexts. However, <br>the WG as a whole understands the intent of the document and, broadly, the <br>decisions that are fundamental to it, and there is no audible dissent at the <br>WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? <br>If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the <br>Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this <br>questionnaire is publicly available.)<br><br>No discontent pertaining to the default BPSec security contexts has been evident <br>in the WG meetings or on the mailing list.<br><br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. <br>(See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist).<br>Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough.<br><br>The idnits tool finds no errors or flaws in the document and issues no warnings.<br>In reference to the Internet-Drafts Checklist:<br>•	No new URLs, email lists, or email aliases are required.<br>•	The Document Shepherd has found no other ID nits.<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such <br>as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>No formal review criteria are known to be applicable. <br><br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either <br>normative or informative?<br><br>Yes, all references have been identified as normative.<br><br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for <br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references <br>exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>The Internet Drafts for Bundle Protocol Version 7 and Bundle Protocol Security <br>Specification are referenced.&nbsp; Those documents have been approved by IESG and <br>are now in the RFC Editor’s queue. <br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these <br>downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references in the document.<br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? <br>Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and <br>discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and <br>Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the <br>relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this <br>information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>Publication of this document will not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, <br>especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm <br>that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the <br>appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA <br>registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA <br>registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the <br>registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and <br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br>No new IANA registries are required.&nbsp; Allocation of two additional entries in <br>the BPSec Security Context Identifiers Registry is noted appropriately.<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future <br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in <br>selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>No new IANA registries are required. <br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd <br>to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML <br>code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>No sections of the BPSec default security contexts specification are written <br>in any formal language.<br></div></td>
