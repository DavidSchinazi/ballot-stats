Especially when it's not necessary.<br><br>---<br><br>This document would benefit from some section somewhere giving a set of clear, numbered steps, saying who sends, who receives, and who does what with what input at each step.&nbsp; I will propose such text.<br><br>Minor editorial nit: you use "a HOBA" fairly consistently, but "an HOBA" appears twice.&nbsp; Oughta fix.<br><br>The abstract appears to overstate the password issue.&nbsp; It'd be better for the abstract to say that it eliminates the transmission of passwords and their storage on the server, which are really the points.&nbsp; The introduction might expand on that a little, noting that passwords might still be used in the user interfaces, but they would be exclusively client-side things, never transmitted and never seen by servers.<br><br>-- Section 2 --<br><br>The definition of "alg" says "the encoding of RSA-SHA256 is 0x30," but the ABNF above says "alg = 1*2DIGIT", which implies "30", not "0x30".&nbsp;  As I look at Section 9.3, I think I see the problem and my confusion.&nbsp; I don't think you want "a single octet" here (otherwise, how would you encode 12 or 99?&nbsp; Don't you really want something like this?:<br><br>OLD<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; alg: specifies the signature algorithm being used encoded as a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; single octet as defined in Section 9.3.&nbsp; RSA-SHA256 MUST be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supported, RSA-SHA1 MAY be supported.&nbsp; The IANA registered<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; algorithm values are encoded as ASCII numbers; for example, the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encoding of RSA-SHA256 is 0x30.<br>NEW<br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; alg: specifies the signature algorithm being used.&nbsp; RSA-SHA256<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST be supported, RSA-SHA1 MAY be supported.&nbsp; The IANA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; registered algorithm values (see Section 9.3) are encoded as one-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or two-digit ASCII numbers.&nbsp; For example, RSA-SHA256 (number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0) is encoded as the ASCII character "0" (0x30), while a future<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; algorithm registered as number 17 would be encoded as the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ASCII characters "17" (0x3137).<br>END<br><br>-- Section 3 --<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The "realm" attribute MUST NOT appear more than once.<br><br>Does that mean that "challenge" and max-age can appear more than once?&nbsp; If not, why call it out for "realm" and not for the others?<br><br>It might be good if the description of "max-age" made it clear that it's for the purpose of allowing multiple uses (multiple sigs).&nbsp; As it is, it looks like it's there to limit the delay before the challenge is answered (once).&nbsp; Maybe just a forward ref to Section 8 is good enough here.<br><br>-- Section 4 --<br><br>The second paragraph starts by saying that localStorage is required, and gives a reference.&nbsp; It ends by saying that localStorage is not required, because IndexedDB works too, and it gives a reference.&nbsp; That's not a disaster, but it's sloppy, and it'd be better to say it all up front.&nbsp; It also makes me wonder whether the security considerations about attacks on localStorage do or don't also apply to IndexedDB.<br><br>Another very minor point: I would avoid using "a hassle for users" in an international document that non-native speakers are expected to understand.&nbsp; "Difficult for users" seems just as good and more understandable to all.<br><br>Does the server really use session cookies to navigate around a site?&nbsp; Or does the server give the client a session cookie for the client to use to navigate?<br><br>-- Section 6.2 --<br><br>It seems odd to put the NOT RECOMMENDED mechanism in the middle; I suggest switching sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3.<br><br>-- Section 8 --<br><br>The first paragraph doesn't say enough to make sense to me.&nbsp; Perhaps a few more words about why?<br><br>-- Section 8.3 --<br>The chances that a typical user (consider my mother) will know or care about this, much less will "request" anything is vanishingly small.&nbsp;
