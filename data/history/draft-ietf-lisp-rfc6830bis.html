Remaking Discuss issues: <br><br>Sec 5.3 What is in the Nonce/Map-Version field if both the N and V bits are zero?<br><br>Sec 7.2 The stateful MTU design does not incorporate any security measures against ICMP spoofing. At the very least, the ITR needs to make sure that some fields in the outer IP and UDP headers are hard to guess, and that this information is stored to verify that the ICMP message came from on-path. If this is not possible, the design is not safe to use over IPv4.&nbsp; If hard-to-guess information is not available to be stored deeper in the packet, then it is not safe over IPv6 either.<br><br>Sec 7.2 There is a fourth situation which can arise. If the ETR receives an ICMP packet from an EID in its network. I have a couple of questions about what should happen in this case:<br><br>- How is this communicated to the sender of the flow that triggered the message? Is there an "outer" ICMP to the ITR, and "inner" ICMP to the source EID, both, or neither?<br><br>- Is the ETR responsible for enforcing the MTU to that EID for subsequent flows?</div></td>

 LISP is an overlay protocol that separates control from Data-Plane,<br>&nbsp;  this document specifies the Data-Plane as well as how LISP-capable<br>&nbsp;  routers (Tunnel Routers) exchange packets by encapsulating them to<br>&nbsp;  the appropriate location.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: comma splice<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-Prefix:&nbsp;  An EID-Prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocated to a site by an address allocation authority.&nbsp; EID-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefixes are associated with a set of RLOC addresses.&nbsp; EID-Prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is to be associated with the larger EID-Prefix block.<br><br>nit(?): this definition might be artifically narrow.&nbsp; E.g., there might<br>be other cases when a prefix can be broken up, including when different<br>RLOC sets are to be assigned to sub-blocks of the larger EID-Prefix.<br><br>&nbsp;  End-System:&nbsp;  An end-system is an IPv4 or IPv6 device that originates<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packets with a single IPv4 or IPv6 header.&nbsp; The end-system<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supplies an EID value for the destination address field of the IP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; header when communicating outside of its routing domain.&nbsp; An end-<br><br>Just to check: when would an end-system supply a destination address<br>that is not an EID (i.e., what requires the "when communicating outside<br>of its routing domain" caveat)?&nbsp; (This is in a mindset that assumes for<br>non-LISP systems the EID and RLOC collapse to the same value usable as<br>either EID or RLOC depending on context.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Routing Locator (RLOC):&nbsp;  An RLOC is an IPv4 [<a href="/doc/rfc791/">RFC0791</a>] or IPv6<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC8200</a>] address of an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR).&nbsp; An RLOC is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the output of an EID-to-RLOC mapping lookup.&nbsp; An EID maps to zero<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or more RLOCs.&nbsp; Typically, RLOCs are numbered from blocks that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assigned to a site at each point to which it attaches to the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; underlay network; where the topology is defined by the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connectivity of provider networks.&nbsp; Multiple RLOCs can be assigned<br><br>nit: the bit after the semicolon is not a complete sentence;

 1.&nbsp; An ETR MAY examine the Locator-Status-Bits in the LISP header of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  an encapsulated data packet received from an ITR.&nbsp; If the ETR is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  also acting as an ITR and has traffic to return to the original<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ITR site, it can use this status information to help select an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RLOC.<br><br>Since we said earlier that LSBs are "a hint to convey up/down router<br>status and not path reachability status", so I'd suggest rephrasing this<br>in terms of "use this status information to avoid selecting routers that<br>are down".<br><br>&nbsp;  When determining Locator up/down reachability by examining the<br>&nbsp;  Locator-Status-Bits from the LISP-encapsulated data packet, an ETR<br>&nbsp;  will receive up-to-date status from an encapsulating ITR about<br>&nbsp;  reachability for all ETRs at the site.&nbsp; CE-based ITRs at the source<br>&nbsp;  site can determine reachability relative to each other using the site<br>&nbsp;  IGP as follows:<br><br>Similarly, we might clarify that this "reachability for all ETRs at the<br>site" reflects local reachability from the ITR in question, and may not<br>be indicative of reachability from the ETR receiving the LSBs.<br><br>&nbsp;  When ITRs at the site are not deployed in CE routers, the IGP can<br>&nbsp;  still be used to determine the reachability of Locators, provided<br>&nbsp;  they are injected into the IGP.&nbsp; This is typically done when a /32<br>&nbsp;  address is configured on a loopback interface.<br><br>"/32 address" seems IPv4-specific.<br><br>&nbsp;  RLOCs listed in a Map-Reply are numbered with ordinals 0 to n-1.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  Locator-Status-Bits in a LISP-encapsulated packet are numbered from 0<br>&nbsp;  to n-1 starting with the least significant bit.&nbsp; For example, if an<br>&nbsp;  RLOC listed in the 3rd position of the Map-Reply goes down (ordinal<br>&nbsp;  value 2), then all ITRs at the site will clear the 3rd least<br>&nbsp;  significant bit (xxxx x0xx) of the 'Locator-Status-Bits' field for<br>&nbsp;  the packets they encapsulate.<br><br>It might be worth a forward-reference to § 13.2 to mention that, in line<br>with map versioning, the ITRs at the site already need to know the<br>Map-Reply contents and to also note that, per Section 5.5 of 6833bis,<br>the list of locators is sorted in a specific order.<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>&nbsp;  When data flows bidirectionally between Locators from different<br>&nbsp;  sites, a Data-Plane mechanism called "nonce echoing" can be used to<br>&nbsp;  determine reachability between an ITR and ETR.&nbsp; When an ITR wants to<br>&nbsp;  solicit a nonce echo, it sets the N- and E-bits and places a 24-bit<br>&nbsp;  nonce [<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>] in the LISP header of the next encapsulated data<br>&nbsp;  packet.<br><br>I do note the title of <a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC 4086</a> and the resulting implication, but since<br>a generic "nonce" is just a "number used once" and can in such cases be<br>a simple counter, I think we really need to say "random nonce" (or<br>"selected from a uniform random distribution" or similar), since we do<br>rely on the unpredictability inherent in a random nonce.&nbsp; For reference,<br>6833bis says "[t]he nonce MUST be generated by a properly seeded<br>pseudo-random source, see as an example [<a href="/doc/rfc4086/">RFC4086</a>]."<br><br>&nbsp;  The ITR will set the E-bit and N-bit for every packet it sends while<br>&nbsp;  in the echo-nonce-request state.&nbsp; The time the ITR waits to process<br>&nbsp;  the echoed nonce before it determines the path is unreachable is<br>&nbsp;  variable and is a choice left for the implementation.<br><br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tcpm-rto-consider/">draft-ietf-tcpm-rto-consider</a>, also on this week's telechat, might be an<br>interesting reference here.<br><br>&nbsp;  The echo-nonce algorithm is bilateral.&nbsp; That is, if one side sets the<br>&nbsp;  E-bit and the other side is not enabled for echo-noncing, then the<br>&nbsp;  echoing of the nonce does not occur and the requesting side may<br>&nbsp;  erroneously consider the Locator unreachable.&nbsp; An ITR SHOULD set the<br>&nbsp;  E-bit in an encapsulated data packet when it knows the ETR is enabled<br>&nbsp;  for echo-noncing.&nbsp; This is conveyed by the E-bit in the Map-Reply<br>&nbsp;  message.<br><br>Do we want a corresponding "SHOULD NOT set the E-bit when [...]" here?<br><br>Also, this could be a good place to note that the Map-Reply E-bit is<br>spoofable in the absence of LISP-SEC.<br><br>&nbsp;  Many implementations default to not advertising they are echo-nonce<br>&nbsp;  capable in Map-Reply messages and so RLOC-probing tends to be used<br>&nbsp;  for RLOC reachability.<br><br>Do we want to hedge this with an "at the time of this writing" in case<br>it ages badly?<br><br>Section 13<br><br>&nbsp;  which ITRs requested its mappings.&nbsp; For scalability reasons, it is<br>&nbsp;  desirable to maintain this approach but need to provide a way for<br>&nbsp;  ETRs to change their mappings and inform the sites that are currently<br>&nbsp;  communicating with the ETR site using such mappings.<br><br>nit: missing word (maybe s/need/there remains a need/?)<br><br>Section 13.1<br><br>&nbsp;  or down).&nbsp; The specific value for the 'use-LSB' timer depends on the<br>&nbsp;  LISP deployment, the 'use-LSB' timer needs to be large enough for the<br>&nbsp;  destination xTR to retreive the updated EID-to-RLOC mappings.&nbsp; A<br><br>nit: comma splice.<br><br>Section 16<br><br>&nbsp;  For example of such attacks, an off-path attacker can exploit the<br>&nbsp;  echo-nonce mechanism by sending data packets to an ITR with a random<br>&nbsp;  nonce from an ETR's spoofed RLOC.&nbsp; Note the attacker must guess a<br>&nbsp;  valid nonce the ITR is requesting to be echoed within a small window<br>&nbsp;  of time.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I suggest noting that "the nonce echoing mechanism defined in this<br>document has only a 24-bit nonce, which is small enough that randomly<br>guessing a nonce will succeed with some regularity".<br>That would also give an opportunity to mention the idea, introduced in<br>lisp-gpe, that a dedicated shim header could be used to provide a longer<br>nonce that is strong enough to be reliable for route-returnability<br>checks (though I concede it's a bit far afield since it's a reference to<br>a reference to future work).<br><br>&nbsp;  Map-Versioning is a Data-Plane mechanism used to signal a peering xTR<br>&nbsp;  that a local EID-to-RLOC mapping has been updated, so that the<br>&nbsp;  peering xTR uses LISP Control-Plane signaling message to retrieve a<br>&nbsp;  fresh mapping.&nbsp; This can be used by an attacker to forge the map-<br>&nbsp;  versioning field of a LISP encapsulated header and force an excessive<br>&nbsp;  amount of signaling between xTRs that may overload them.<br><br>I'd suggest adding at the end ", or prevent updates from being processed".<br><br>&nbsp;  LISP implementations and deployments which permit outer header<br>&nbsp;  fragments of IPv6 LISP encapsulated packets as a means of dealing<br>&nbsp;  with MTU issues should also use implementation techniques in ETRs to<br>&nbsp;  prevent this from being a DoS attack vector.&nbsp; Limits on the number of<br>&nbsp;  fragments awaiting reassembly at an ETR, RTR, or PETR, and the rate<br>&nbsp;  of admitting such fragments may be used.<br><br>I note that <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-frag-fragile/">draft-ietf-intarea-frag-fragile</a> might be a relevant<br>reference (and is in the RFC Editor's queue).<br><br>Section 20.1<br><br>How can <a href="/doc/rfc6830/">RFC 6830</a> be a normative reference when this document Obsoletes<br>it?<br><br>It's not really clear that RFCs 6831 or 8378 need to be normative;

I realize that this is probably because the no-internet provisions entered late in the game. If it were my document, I might reorganize it to make the distinction more clear (i.e. present the internet-safe dataplane spec and then have additional sections about insecure add-ons). That said, at this stage in the game I'd be happy to have a new section that clarified what is what.

At the very least, the ITR needs to make sure that some fields in the outer IP and UDP headers are hard to guess, and that this information is stored to verify that the ICMP message came from on-path. If this is not possible, the design is not safe to use over IPv4.&nbsp; If hard-to-guess information is not available to be stored deeper in the packet, then it is not safe over IPv6 either.<br><br>Sec 7.2 There is a fourth situation which can arise. If the ETR receives an ICMP packet from an EID in its network. I have a couple of questions about what should happen in this case:<br><br>- How is this communicated to the sender of the flow that triggered the message? Is there an "outer" ICMP to the ITR, and "inner" ICMP to the source EID, both, or neither?<br><br>- Is the ETR responsible for enforcing the MTU to that EID for subsequent flows?<br><br>Sec 9. I don't understand what this sentence means:<br>"The client-side ITR controls how traffic is returned and can alternate using an outer-header source RLOC, which then can be added to the list the server-side ETR uses to return traffic."<br><br>This would appear to be the inverse of the "Routing Locator Hashing" discussion in Section 12, which provides a technique for switching destination RLOC. Is this "alternation" of source RLOC mean to be done on hashed 5-tuple basis (i.e. each flow uses only one source RLOC)?<br><br>If not, would this involve potentially sending packets for one flow on different interfaces with different path characteristics, causing packet reordering. Or perhaps you mean each packet is sent from the same interface with a spoofed source RLOC, which creates interesting issues for ICMP returns and the like.</div></td>

Worst case the RFC editor can hold this document in the queue until there is a RFC number for them.<br><br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC<br>3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area<br>Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>	&nbsp; There are no downward normative references.<br><br><br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are<br>not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to<br>the part of the document where the relationship of this document to<br>the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the<br>document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>	This document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc6830/">RFC 6830</a>, as mentioned in the header, abstract and introduction.<br><br><br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA<br>considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with<br>the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that<br>the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in<br>IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been<br>clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include<br>a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry,<br>that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and<br>a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC<br>5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  IANA already allocated UDP port number 4341 for the LISP Data-Plane. This document just demands to update the description as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The IANA registry has allocated UDP port number 4341 for the LISP<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Data-Plane.&nbsp; IANA has updated the description for UDP port 4341 as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  follows:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lisp-data&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4341 udp&nbsp; &nbsp; LISP Data Packets<br><br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for<br>future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would<br>find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>	No expert review is required.<br><br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>	&nbsp; The document does not contain anything written in a formal<br>	&nbsp; language, hence, no validation and/or check has been<br>	&nbsp; performed.<br></div></td>

 EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache:&nbsp;  The EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache is generally<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; short-lived, on-demand table in an ITR that stores, tracks, and is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; responsible for timing out and otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp;

 Endpoint ID (EID):&nbsp;  An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv6) value used in the source and destination address fields of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the first (most inner) LISP header of a packet.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; count of 0.&nbsp; This type of entry could be used to describe a prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from a non-LISP site, which is explicitly not in the mapping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; database.&nbsp; There are a set of well-defined actions that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encoded in a Negative Map-Reply.<br><br>This bit about Negative Map-Replys comes out of the blue; is it really<br>needed in this paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;  TE-ETR:&nbsp;  A TE-ETR is an ETR that is deployed in a service provider<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network that strips an outer LISP header for Traffic Engineering<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purposes.<br><br>nit: is it really the act of stripping the header that is done for TE<br>purposes?<br><br>Also in Section 3 (moved from Discuss, since probably editorial):<br>&nbsp;

The LISP ITR must be able to map the destination EID to an RLOC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  of one of the ETRs at the destination site.&nbsp; The specific method<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  used to do this is not described in this example.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When using Data-Probes, by sending Map-Requests on<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the underlying routing system, EID-Prefixes must be advertised.<br><br>I don't understand why the one follows from the other (in fact, there seem<br>to be three not-particularly-related concepts in this sentence).<br><br>(I also note that "Data-Probe" is not mentioned anywhere in this document<br>other than its own definition, which would suggest that it could be moved<br>to 6833bis, which does mention them.)<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-to-RLOC Database:&nbsp;  The EID-to-RLOC Database is a global<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; distributed database that contains all known EID-Prefix-to-RLOC<br><br>I thought we had agreed to remove this "global distributed database"<br>language.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; addresses that are routable on the underlay.&nbsp; Note that there MAY<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be transient conditions when the EID-Prefix for the site and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Locator-Set for each EID-Prefix may not be the same on all ETRs.<br><br>nit: we haven't indicated a definite site for "the site" to be meaningful.<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache:&nbsp;  The EID-to-RLOC Map-Cache is generally<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; short-lived, on-demand table in an ITR that stores, tracks, and is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; responsible for timing out and otherwise validating EID-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mappings.&nbsp; This cache is distinct from the full "database" of EID-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to-RLOC mappings; it is dynamic, local to the ITR(s), and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relatively small, while the database is distributed, relatively<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; static, and much more global in scope to LISP nodes.<br><br>"global" caught my eye again here; perhaps "global in scope to a LISP<br>deployment"?<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-Prefix:&nbsp;  An EID-Prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocated to a site by an address allocation authority.&nbsp; EID-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefixes are associated with a set of RLOC addresses.&nbsp; EID-Prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is to be associated with the larger EID-Prefix block.<br><br>nit: I think the causality here is backwards -- the breaking up does not<br>occur at the moment that you associate an RLOC set to a larger EID-Prefix<br>block.<br><br>&nbsp;  Endpoint ID (EID):&nbsp;  An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv6) value used in the source and destination address fields of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the first (most inner) LISP header of a packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>6833bis says (section 5.8) that the inner header can use either RLOC or EID<br>addresses in the header address fields, which contradicts this statement.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Specifically, when a service provider prepends a LISP header for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traffic Engineering purposes, the router that does this is also<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regarded as an ITR.&nbsp; The outer RLOC the ISP ITR uses can be based<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the outer destination address (the originating ITR's supplied<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RLOC) or the inner destination address (the originating host's<br><br>Er, that the ISP ITR uses as source or as destination?<br><br>&nbsp;  Negative Mapping Entry:&nbsp;  A negative mapping entry, also known as a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negative cache entry, is an EID-to-RLOC entry where an EID-Prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is advertised or stored with no RLOCs.&nbsp; That is, the Locator-Set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for the EID-to-RLOC entry is empty, one with an encoded Locator<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; count of 0.&nbsp; This type of entry could be used to describe a prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from a non-LISP site, which is explicitly not in the mapping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; database.&nbsp; There are a set of well-defined actions that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encoded in a Negative Map-Reply.<br><br>This bit about Negative Map-Replys comes out of the blue; is it really<br>needed in this paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;  TE-ETR:&nbsp;  A TE-ETR is an ETR that is deployed in a service provider<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; network that strips an outer LISP header for Traffic Engineering<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; purposes.<br><br>nit: is it really the act of stripping the header that is done for TE<br>purposes?<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; mappings.&nbsp; This cache is distinct from the full "database" of EID-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to-RLOC mappings; it is dynamic, local to the ITR(s), and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; relatively small, while the database is distributed, relatively<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; static, and much more global in scope to LISP nodes.<br><br>"global" caught my eye again here; perhaps "global in scope to a LISP<br>deployment"?<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-Prefix:&nbsp;  An EID-Prefix is a power-of-two block of EIDs that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocated to a site by an address allocation authority.&nbsp; EID-<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prefixes are associated with a set of RLOC addresses.&nbsp; EID-Prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; allocations can be broken up into smaller blocks when an RLOC set<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is to be associated with the larger EID-Prefix block.<br><br>nit: I think the causality here is backwards -- the breaking up does not<br>occur at the moment that you associate an RLOC set to a larger EID-Prefix<br>block.<br><br>&nbsp;  Endpoint ID (EID):&nbsp;  An EID is a 32-bit (for IPv4) or 128-bit (for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IPv6) value used in the source and destination address fields of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the first (most inner) LISP header of a packet.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>6833bis says (section 5.8) that the inner header can use either RLOC or EID<br>addresses in the header address fields, which contradicts this statement.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Specifically, when a service provider prepends a LISP header for<br>&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; count of 0.&nbsp; This type of entry could be used to describe a prefix<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from a non-LISP site, which is explicitly not in the mapping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; database.&nbsp; There are a set of well-defined actions that are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encoded in a Negative Map-Reply.<br><br>This bit about Negative Map-Replys comes out of the blue; is it really<br>needed in this paragraph?<br><br>&nbsp;

What happens when the *actual* MTU on the path is e.g 1476 because there is a tunnel on the path? <br>The text also mentions "which is less than the ITR’s estimate of the path MTU between the ITR and its correspondent ETR" - this implies that the ITR is tracking / estimating the MTU, which a: doesn't align with the rest of the text, or b: sounds like the stateful solution below.<br>I have reread this multiple times, but it still feels like it is avoiding the issue by defining it to not exist.<br><br>4: "Note that reassembly can happen at the ETR if the encapsulated packet was fragmented at or after the ITR." - I think that there needs to be more text / description about resource constraints on routers performing reassembly of fragments - in most cases a router doesn't have to / isn't expected to have to reassemble transit packets from arbitrary sources on the Internet (things where routers may reassemble are aimed at the control plane which can be rate-limited, or are from expected source addresses). It seems that spoofing lots of initial fragments without the final one will be a tax on the router. <br><br>5: "Instead of using the Map-Cache or mapping system, RLOC information MAY be gleaned from received tunneled packets or Map-Request messages. A "gleaned" Map-Cache entry, one learned from the source RLOC of a received encapsulated packet, is only stored and used for a few seconds, pending verification." - it seems that this is ripe for abuse (or I'm missing in the cache expiration). I want to hijack traffic from Site X to well known Service Y, so I look up Service Y and save the TTL from the Map-Reply. I then start spoof packets listing myself as the ETR - eventually Site X will glean from my spoofed packets, and start sending traffic to me - yes, this will only work for a few seconds -- but as soon as I stop getting packets from site X, I know site X has verified the entry and discovered it is wrong... and that the TTL is now being deprecated. I start a timer, and second or two less than the TTL later I start spoofing packets again, knowing that site X will soon expire the cache entry and will once again be willing to accept mine again. A: I get some Site X to Site Y traffic for a few seconds every TTL seconds, and B: the loss of this traffic is a signal that TTL seconds again it will need to be refreshed. <br><br> 6: "10.1.&nbsp; Echo Nonce Algorithm" -- If I spoof lots of packets with the N- and E-bits set, the receiving ETR will need to keep false state, and presumably I can overfill a cache. This will cause the ETR to not be able to include the received nonce on legitimate traffic, and so the ITR on the far side will think this ETR is down. This seems like a fairly easy DoS. I'm guessing that this can be worked around by not setting the E bit in the RLOC-probe Map-Reply message, but this feels like a dangerous foot gun, and should at least be noted. Note that this is different to the "Note the attacker must guess a valid nonce the ITR is requesting to be echoed within a small window of time.&nbsp; The goal is to convince the ITR that the ETR’s RLOC is&nbsp; reachable even when it may not be reachable."&nbsp; attack listed in the document in that a: it doesn't require any guessing, and b: makes an ETR appear down, not up. <br><br>The document does mention "... attack can be mitigated by preventing RLOC spoofing in the network by deploying uRPF <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc2827/">RFC2827</a>]." - while that may be true for many of the above, <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP38</a> is far from being universally deployed, and this feels similar to solving world hunger by saying everyone must have enough food. :-)<br><br>Again, apologies if I've completely misunderstood something, clue-bat gladly accepted...</div></td>

The field is 32 bits when the I-bit is set to 0 and is 8 bits when the I-bit is set to 1." - I think I'm missing something fairly fundamental here (and in Section 10, 13.1, and others) - if I'm using the I bit, it sounds like I can only have 8 ETRs?

While some of my<br>concerns are not specific to this document, as the core protocol<br>(data-plane) spec, it seems an appropriate place to attach them to.<br><br>I am told, out of band, that the intended deployment model is no longer to<br>cover the entire Internet (c.f. the MISSREF-state<br><a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-introduction/">draft-ietf-lisp-introduction</a>'s "with LISP, the dge of the Internet and the<br>core can be logically separated and interconnected by LISP-capable<br>routers", etc.), and that full Internet-scale operation is no longer a<br>goal.&nbsp; However, since that does not seem to be reflected in the current<br>batch of documents up for IESG review, I am forced to ballot on them<br>"as-is", namely as targetting global Internet deployment.&nbsp; The requirements<br>placed on the mapping system are so stringent so as to be arguably<br>unachievable at Internet-scale, though that arguably has more of an<br>interaction with the control-plane than the data-plane.&nbsp; It's still in<br>scope here, though, as part of the overall description of the protocol<br>flow.<br><br>There are an almost innumerable number of downgrade attacks possible, and<br>the control-plane and data-plane security mechanisms are not normative<br>dependencies of the current corpus of documents, and as such are not up for<br>consideration as mitigating the security concerns with the core documents.<br><br>Section 3 defines the EID-to-RLOC Datbaase:<br><br>&nbsp;  EID-to-RLOC Database:&nbsp;  The EID-to-RLOC Database is a global<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; distributed database that contains all known EID-Prefix-to-RLOC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mappings.&nbsp; Each potential ETR typically contains a small piece of<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the database: the EID-to-RLOC mappings for the EID-Prefixes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "behind" the router.&nbsp; These map to one of the router's own<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; globally visible IP addresses.&nbsp; Note that there MAY be transient<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; conditions when the EID-Prefix for the site and Locator-Set for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; each EID-Prefix may not be the same on all ETRs.&nbsp; This has no<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negative implications, since a partial set of Locators can be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; used.<br><br>No compelling architecture for a trustworthy global distributed database<br>has been presented that I've seen so far, and LISP relies heavily on the<br>mapping system's database for its functionality.&nbsp; I am concerned that so<br>many requirements are placed on the mapping system so as to be in effect<br>unimplementable, in which case it would seem that the architecture as a<br>whole (that is, for a global Internet-scale system) is not fit for purpose.<br><br>Section 4.1's Step (6) only mentions parsing "to check for format<br>validity".&nbsp; I think it is appropriate to mention (and refer to) source<br>authentication checks as well, since bad Map-Reply data can allow all sorts<br>of attacks to occur.<br><br>There are some fairly subtle ordering requirements between the order of<br>entries in Map-Reply messages and the Locator-Status-Bits in data-plane<br>traffic (so that the semantic meaning of the status bits are meaningful),<br>which is only given a minimal treatment in the control-plane document.&nbsp; The<br>need for synchronization in interpreting these bits should be mentioned<br>more prominently in the data-plane document as well.<br><br>The usage of the Instance ID does not seem to be adequately covered; from<br>what I've been able to pick up so far it seems that both source and<br>destination participants must agree on the meaning of an Instance ID, and<br>the source and destination EIDs must be in the same Instance.&nbsp; This does<br>not seem like it is compatible with Internet scale, especially if there are<br>only 24 usable bits of Instance ID.<br><br>There seems to be a lot of intra-site synchronization requirements, notably<br>with respect to Map-Version consistency, the contents and ordering of<br>locator sets for EIDs in the site, etc.; the actual hard requirements for<br>synchronization within a site should be clearly called out, ideally in a<br>single location.<br><br>The security considerations attempt to defer substantially to the<br>threat-analysis in <a href="/doc/rfc7835/">RFC 7835</a>, which does not really seem like a complete<br>threat analysis and does not provide analysis as to what requirements are<br>placed on the boundaries between the different components of LISP (data<br>plane, control plane, mapping system, various extensions, etc.).&nbsp; The<br>secdir reviewer had some good thoughts in this space.<br><br>The security considerations throughout the LISP documents place a heavy<br>focus on the risk of over-claiming for routing EID-prefixes.&nbsp; This is a<br>real concern, to be clear, but it should not overshadow the risk of an<br>attacker who is able to move traffic around at will, strip security<br>protections, cause denial of service, alter data-plane payloads, etc.<br>Similarly, this document's security considerations call out denial of<br>service as a risk from Map-Cache insertion/spoofing, but the risks from an<br>attacker being able to read and modify the traffic, perhaps even without<br>detection, seems a much greater threat to me.<br><br>I am not convinced that this protocol meets the current IETF requirements<br>for the security properties of Standards-Track Protocols without at least<br>LISP-SEC as a mandatory-to-implement component, and possibly additional or<br>stronger requirements.&nbsp; (I did not do a full analysis of the system in the<br>presence of those security mechanisms, since that is not what is being<br>presented for review.)<br><br>Having an EID that is associated to user-correlatable devices has severe<br>privacy considerations, but I could not find this mentioned anywhere in all<br>of the LISP documents I've read so far.</div></td>

In such<br>&nbsp;  a situation, termed "Recursive Tunneling", an ISP transit acts as an<br>&nbsp;  additional ITR, and the RLOC it uses for the new prepended header<br>&nbsp;  would be either a TE-ETR within the ISP (along an intra-ISP traffic<br>&nbsp;  engineered path) or a TE-ETR within another ISP (an inter-ISP traffic<br>&nbsp;  engineered path, where an agreement to build such a path exists).<br><br>"the RLOC it uses for the new prepnded header", again, this is as the<br>destination RLOC (vs. source RLOC)?<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;

A "gleaned" Map-Cache<br>&nbsp;  entry, one learned from the source RLOC of a received encapsulated<br>&nbsp;  packet, is only stored and used for a few seconds, pending<br>&nbsp;  verification.&nbsp; Verification is performed by sending a Map-Request to<br>&nbsp;  the source EID (the inner-header IP source address) of the received<br>&nbsp;  encapsulated packet.<br><br>The source EID is some random end system, right?&nbsp; So this relys on some<br>magic in the ETR to detect that there's a Map-Request and reply directly<br>instead of passing it on to the EID that won't know what to do with it?<br><br>Talking about the "R-bit" of the Map-Reply" is detail from 6833bis and<br>might benefit from an explicit section reference to the other document.<br><br>Section 10<br><br>What is the "CE" of "CE-based ITRs"?&nbsp; Presumably Customer Edge, but it<br>is not marked as well-known at<br><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt">https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt</a> so expansion is<br>probably in order.<br><br>Again, when we are talking about the internal structure of the Map-Reply, a<br>detailed section refernce to 6833bis is useful.<br><br>Modifying LSBs seems like a fine DoS attack vector for an on-path attacker.<br><br>&nbsp;  value of 1.&nbsp; Locator-Status-Bits are associated with a Locator-Set<br>&nbsp;  per EID-Prefix.&nbsp; Therefore, when a Locator becomes unreachable, the<br>&nbsp;  Locator-Status-Bit that corresponds to that Locator's position in the<br>&nbsp;  list returned by the last Map-Reply will be set to zero for that<br>&nbsp;  particular EID-Prefix<br><br>Doesn't this imply a stateful relationship between the ordering of<br>Map-Replys and data-plane traffic?<br><br>Section 10.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that "ITR" and "ETR" are relative terms here.&nbsp; Both devices MUST<br>&nbsp;  be implementing both ITR and ETR functionality for the echo nonce<br>&nbsp;  mechanism to operate.<br><br>Perhaps they could be given actual names so as to disambiguate which steps<br>are performed with ITR vs. ETR role?<br><br>&nbsp;  The echo-nonce algorithm is bilateral.&nbsp; That is, if one side sets the<br>&nbsp;  E-bit and the other side is not enabled for echo-noncing, then the<br>&nbsp;  echoing of the nonce does not occur and the requesting side may<br>&nbsp;  erroneously consider the Locator unreachable.&nbsp; An ITR SHOULD only set<br>&nbsp;  the E-bit in an encapsulated data packet when it knows the ETR is<br>&nbsp;  enabled for echo-noncing.&nbsp; This is conveyed by the E-bit in the RLOC-<br>&nbsp;  probe Map-Reply message.<br><br>Why is this even optional?&nbsp; If it was mandatory to use, then there would<br>not be a question.&nbsp; But at least clarify that the "this" that is conveyed<br>is whether the peer supports the echo-nonce algorithm.&nbsp; (Also, subject to<br>downgrade.)<br><br>Section 13<br><br>&nbsp;  When a Locator record is removed from a Locator-Set, ITRs that have<br>&nbsp;  the mapping cached will not use the removed Locator because the xTRs<br>&nbsp;  will set the Locator-Status-Bit to 0.&nbsp; So, even if the Locator is in<br>&nbsp;  the list, it will not be used.&nbsp; For new mapping requests, the xTRs<br>&nbsp;  can set the Locator AFI to 0 (indicating an unspecified address), as<br>&nbsp;  well as setting the corresponding Locator-Status-Bit to 0.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  forces ITRs with old or new mappings to avoid using the removed<br>&nbsp;  Locator.<br><br>The behavior describe here seems like it would be better described as "when<br>a Locator is taken out of service" than "removed from a Locator-Set", since<br>if it is not in the set at all, it has no index, and no LSB or AFI to set.<br>Should actually depopulating it like this be forbidden?<br><br>I guess the Map Versioning is supposed to help with this, but we need to<br>nail down the semantics more and/or give a clearer reference to it.<br><br>Section 13.1<br><br>&nbsp;  An ITR, when it encapsulates packets to ETRs, can convey its own Map-<br>&nbsp;  Version Number.&nbsp; This is known as the Source Map-Version Number.<br><br>Replacing "its own Map-Version Number" with something like "the Map-Version<br>numer for the LISP site of which it is a part".&nbsp; Writing this causes me to<br>note that the semantics of the Map-Version are unclear, here -- what is it<br>scoped to?&nbsp; An EID-Prefix?&nbsp; An RLOC?&nbsp; Oh, you say that in the next<br>paragraph (EID-Prefix).<br><br>&nbsp;  A Map-Version Number can be included in Map-Register messages as<br>&nbsp;  well.&nbsp; This is a good way for the Map-Server to assure that all ETRs<br>&nbsp;  for a site registering to it will be synchronized according to Map-<br>&nbsp;  Version Number.<br><br>Huh?&nbsp; I must be confused how this works.&nbsp; (Also, wouldn't this be better in<br>the control plane document which covers Map-Register?)<br><br>Section 15<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; When a tunnel-encapsulated packet is received by an ETR, the outer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; destination address may not be the address of the router.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; makes it challenging for the control plane to get packets from the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hardware.&nbsp; This may be mitigated by creating special Forwarding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Information Base (FIB) entries for the EID-Prefixes of EIDs served<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by the ETR (those for which the router provides an RLOC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; translation).&nbsp; These FIB entries are marked with a flag indicating<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that Control-Plane processing SHOULD be performed.<br><br>I assume this is just my lack of background showing, but I'm confused how<br>it makes sense to mark these for control-plane processing.&nbsp; Isn't the<br>control plane much slower, and we're not putting all of the LISP data-plane<br>traffic onto the slow path?<br><br>Section 18<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Data-Plane gleaning for creating map-cache entries has been made<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; optional.&nbsp; If any ITR implementations depend or assume the remote<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ETR is gleaning should not do so.<br><br>nit: this is ungrammatical; "they should not" or "Any ITR implementations<br>that depend on or assume that" would fix it.<br><br>Section 19.1<br><br>Presumably IANA also updated the reference column to point to this<br>document?</div></td>

I start with the straight-forward onces:<br><br>1) Unfortunately ECN decapsulation is slightly more complicated than described in section 5.3. Please check section 3.2 in <a href="/doc/rfc6040/">rfc6040</a> and revise accordingly (maybe also provide a pointer to <a href="/doc/rfc6040/">rfc6040</a> instead or in addition to <a href="/doc/rfc3168/">rfc3168</a>)! (Also it seems like the text on ECN is simply just twice in sec 5.3; not sure that is helpful).<br><br>2) Further, also in sec 5.3:<br>"The inner-header 'Differentiated Services Code Point' (DSCP) field<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (or the 'Traffic Class' field, in the case of IPv6) SHOULD be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; copied from the outer-header DSCP field ('Traffic Class' field, in<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the case of IPv6) considering the exception listed below."<br>However, I didn't find any exceptions listed later in the doc. However, setting the DSCP field might also be matter of local policy. E.g. if DSCP is not used for a different purpose in the receiver side LISP network, it could make sense to restore/keep the original value in the inner header.<br><br>3) Sec 7.1. only takes about ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" packets while "IPv4-encapsulated packet with the DF bit set to 1" should be addressed as well.<br><br>4) I would like to see another sentence in section 12 explicitly stating that the source port SHOULD be the same for all packet belong to the same flow.<br><br>5) Sec 5.3 says "Both N- and V-bits MUST NOT be set in the same packet."<br>What happens if both bits are set? The 'Nonce/Map-Version' is just ignored, or maybe the packet should be dropped or something? Please clarify in the doc!<br><br>6) And now the more-discussion-needed point:<br>So my underlying concern is the same as brought up by the TSV-ART review that lisp information are not end-to-end integrity protected or authenticated. However, while briefly thinking about how this could be eventually realized, I noticed that there is actually no mechanism to extend the LISP header in any way. There is no version, no option and the LISP header seems to have a fixed, implicitly specified length without an explicit length field. This seems too late to add any kind of extensibility mechanism at this stage of the protocols lifetime, however, I would still like to discuss if there was any discussion about extensibility, what was the reason to chose this approach, and potential if some background about the choice should be given in the doc.</div></td>

The RFC type is indicated in the page header.<br><br><br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>	The document provides the specifications for the data-plane of LISP&nbsp; (Locator/Id Separation Protocol).&nbsp; LISP defines two namespaces, End-point&nbsp; Identifiers (EIDs) that identify end-hosts and Routing Locators (RLOCs) that identify network attachment points. In this way, LISP effectively separates control from data, and allows routers to create overlay networks.&nbsp; LISP-capable routers exchange encapsulated packets according to EID-to-RLOC mappings stored in a local Map-Cache.<br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>	The current LISP WG charter has as main task porting the main LISP specifications on Standard Track. The WG has decided to focus on two main documents, one with the specifications of the data-plane and the other with the specifications of the control-plane. This document concerns the data-plane. The WG has showed support to the document from its first submission as individual draft and adopted it right away. On the technical side there was agreement in the WG and little discussion took place, mainly related include some features/improvements not present in <a href="/doc/rfc6830/">RFC 6830</a>. On the organisation of the document, more specifically on what to put in the data-plane document and what to put in the control-plane document there has been quite some discussion. The current version is the trade-off the WG&nbsp; achieved and for which clear consensus has been reached. The version of the document that was approved during WG Last Call is -12. As a shepherd I required a few editorial changes to the document to fix some nits.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant<br>number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a<br>thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a<br>conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a<br>MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course<br>(briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the<br>request posted?<br><br>	There are several independent implementations of the LISP data-plane.<br><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br><br>&nbsp; Luigi Iannone <br><br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Deborah Brungard .<br><br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br><br>&nbsp; I reviewed carefully the document. The text is clear and	understandable. I have checked the mailinglist and meeting minutes and publication WG consensus has been reached appropriately. I checked the ID nits and decided to ask the authors to fix them before submitting this writeup. The output of the IDnits tool for the -14 version of the document is provided on point 11.<br><br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>	As the document shepherd I have no concerns.<br><br><br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp; No broader review is required for this document.<br><br><br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document<br>Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director<br>and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is<br>uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns<br>whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has<br>discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to<br>advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br><br>	I have no specific concerns or issues to point out.<br><br><br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP<br>78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>	No IPR disclosures have been filed concerning this specific document. However, there is an IPR disclosure filled by Huawei on <a href="/doc/rfc6830/">RFC 6830</a>, hence, because this document is largely based on that one, the same IPR disclosure may relate to this document.<br><br><br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?
