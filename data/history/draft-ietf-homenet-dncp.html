I'd<br>also speculate that you might end up changing this if it gets<br>more security review, but again that's hard to get in the<br>abstract.&nbsp; Basically: be prepared for changes as this is made<br>concrete and if that would be a problem please yell now.&nbsp; If<br>you do yell, I'm fine with making this a DISCUSS so we're sure<br>to resolve it. (I nearly did make this a DISCUSS, as I'm not<br>sure this is all fully worked out, but I'm ok that we can fix<br>that later. And you have enough DISCUSS ballots;-)<br><br>- The write up notes various drafts were input to what became<br>this one. I assume that none of those had associated IPR that<br>hasn't trickled through to being noted as applying to this<br>one? If not, as I expect, that's fine, no response is needed,<br>I'm just noting this since I didn't see any "replaced by"<br>entries in the history and it's those that cause IPR to be<br>transitively visible.<br><br>- section 2 - it's not clear to me why all node identifiers<br>need to be the same length - some protocols using DNCP could I<br>guess have variable length identifiers. IPv4 and IPv6 and<br>Ethernet for example all have different lengths.<br><br>- 4.2: seems to contradict itself. 1st para says that MC is<br>not used for anything sensitive, but 2nd-last para of section<br>says that network state TLVs can be sent "now and then."<br>(Reason to ask is that (D)TLS won't work if sensitive data is<br>sent via MC.)<br><br>- 4.4, 2nd para: what is a "valid" address? <br><br>- 8.1: do you mean one PSK per network or per pair of nodes?<br>Better to say. I assume it's the former.<br><br>- 8.3: This is an example of (a fairly complex) use of<br>opportunistic security (<a href="/doc/rfc7435/">RFC7435</a>). Be good to note that.<br><br>- 8.3: Calling this "certificate based" is I think a misnomer.<br>I suspect all the same things could be done with raw public<br>keys (<a href="/doc/rfc7250/">RFC 7250</a>).<br><br>- 8.3: please do note that a concrete protocol might need<br>changes to this distributed algorithm and that this section is<br>guidance and not to be considered entirely fixed (when<br>coding).</div></td>

I believe the concept of an "abstract protocol specification" does not align with the IETF's goal of generating clear and inter-operable protocol specifications. This approach requires an implementer to resolve differences between the abstract protocol specification and the profile rather than simply implementing a single protocol specification. Such an approach has a higher probability of error than the single specification approach. If the basic premise of a protocol is sound and applicable for other uses, a new protocol specification can be written that borrows the necessary part from the previous protocol and makes any requisite changes for the new use.<br><br>Given this, I will not support the publication of this draft, but I will not stand in its way given the perceived rough consensus for it.</div></td>

Abstract.&nbsp; "DNCP is an abstract protocol, and must be combined with a specific profile to make a complete implementable protocol.”&nbsp; The shepherd’s writeup claims implementations.&nbsp; The links show that the implementation is of HNCP.&nbsp; It would have been better to progress both IDs together to better understand any dependencies, etc.<br><br>2. There are several places in the document where time-related actions or states are described using uncertain, maybe even sloppy language.&nbsp; It would be ideal if that was cleaned up and the text was as specific as possible.&nbsp; For instance:<br><br>2a. Recent.&nbsp; The phrase "recently bidirectionally reachable” is used in a couple of places.&nbsp; Note that the definition of “bidirectionally reachable” also uses “recent": “…if a recent and consistent multicast or any unicast DNCP message has been received…”&nbsp; What does “recent” mean?&nbsp; A naïve interpretation may be that the peer was (not long ago) reachable, but not anymore.&nbsp;  Knowing that the keep-alives are optional, what is the criteria&nbsp; for “recent”?&nbsp; Section 4.5. (Adding and Removing Peers) seems to provide some hints related to the ability to verify that the peer is present — that is a specific criteria, unlike the use of “recent”.&nbsp; Please be specific.<br><br>2b. Now and then.&nbsp; Section 4.2. (Data Transport): “…send Network State TLVs every now and then, as specified in Section 4.3”&nbsp; Section 4.3 (Trickle-Driven Status Updates) explains: "Every time a particular Trickle instance indicates that an update should be sent, the node MUST send a Network State TLV…”&nbsp;  If I got this correctly, <a href="/doc/rfc6206/">rfc6206</a> talks about updates being needed when the version numbers don’t match — that is a very specific case and not just “every now and then”.&nbsp; Please clarify what those triggers may be, or include a reference — in both places to take away the uncertainty.<br><br>2c. Eventually.&nbsp;  Section 4.4 (Processing of Received TLVs) “…an implementation MUST eventually reply to similar repeated requests, as otherwise state synchronization breaks.”&nbsp;  It is clear that “eventually” is really time bound — what is that boundary?<br><br><br>3. Section 6.1.2. (Per-Endpoint Periodic Keep-Alives), 6.1.3. (Per-Peer Periodic Keep-Alives) and 6.1.5. (Peer Removal): "the endpoint-specific keep-alive interval” is used — initially I thought that you meant DNCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL, but it isn’t until 6.1.5 when the term is defined.<br><br>4. Section 7.1.1. (Request Network State TLV)&nbsp; If the Length is &gt; 0, what can the Value be?&nbsp; Nothing is specified.<br><br>5. Section 7.3. (Data TLVs within Node State TLV)&nbsp; Just to clarify, the TLVs in this section would be carried in the Node Data field of the Node State TLV, right?&nbsp; If so, then it would be clearer if it was explicitly mentioned.<br><br>6. References.&nbsp; I think that both <a href="/doc/rfc6347/">RFC6347</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a> should be Informational as the document doesn’t actually mandate their use — it just points at them as what the profiles may (or may not) specify.<br><br>Nits:<br>A. 4.2. (Data Transport)&nbsp;  s/to speeds up/to speed up<br>B. 4.4. (Processing of Received TLVs)&nbsp;  The notation ("H(Node Data)”, for example) for the hash function is used, but it is defined later in the draft.&nbsp; Please add a reference.</div></td>

I have a number of specific comments.&nbsp;  Some of these are hazards to technical interoperability; I've tried<br>to include those in my discuss - but the general point is that it is very hard to tell a number of details because the<br>structure is assumed.&nbsp;  Having read this document, I do not think that I could properly implement DNCP from scratch.<br><br>Obviously, I can guess at the answers - but that doesn't let everyone interoperate well.&nbsp;  Examples include:<br><br>a) What is a topology graph?&nbsp; When is it created, modified, or destroyed?&nbsp; Is it a conceptual artifact constructed<br>from the various TLVs?&nbsp; I think a quick paragraph describing it would help.<br><br>b) How are peer relationships discovered and established and destroyed?&nbsp; I really can't tell from the draft and even a quick scan of <br><a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a> doesn't give any hints.<br><br>c) It looks like the TLVs are sent one after another in a datagram or stream across a socket.&nbsp; The closest I see to any detail<br>is "TLVs are sent across the transport as is".&nbsp; <br><br>d) As far as I can tell, Trickle is used to decide basically how often to send information - but the details of this and the interactions<br>aren't clear to me.<br><br>I suspect that there are dependencies on the HNCP draft that would make this a lot easier to understand but since we want it to progress<br>separately, the document does need to stand alone.<br><br>Although not noted in the Shepherd's report, I did have a thorough Routing Directorate review done and the draft was improved from that.<br><br>8) In Sec 4.6 "&nbsp;  o&nbsp; The origination time (in milliseconds) of R's node data is greater<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; than current time in - 2^32 + 2^15."&nbsp; Since origination time hasn't yet been introduced, I'm going<br>on an assumption that it means when R's node data was originated from R.&nbsp; So - this requirement is<br>saying that R's node data must have been generated in the future (but already known by the local node)???<br><br>9) In Sec 4.6 "They MAY be removed immediately after the topology graph traversal"&nbsp; The DNCP nodes can<br>be removed from what??&nbsp; The topology graph?&nbsp; From some type of received TLV??&nbsp; How would they be<br>added back in later?<br><br>11) In sec 6.1: "Trickle-driven status updates (Section 4.3) provide a mechanism for<br>&nbsp;  handling of new peer detection on an endpoint, as well as state<br>&nbsp;  change notifications."&nbsp;  Nothing in Sec 4.3 talked about a mechanism for detecting<br>new peers on an endpoint.&nbsp; It is entirely possible that Trickle does provide this (but what<br>about the modes where Trickle isn't used/needed??) but there needs to be a description of how<br>new peer detection is done - even if it's just a pointer to Trickle RFCs.<br><br>12) In Sec 6.1.4: "&nbsp;  On receipt of a Network State TLV (Section 7.2.2) which is consistent<br>&nbsp;  with the locally calculated network state hash, the Last contact<br>&nbsp;  timestamp for the peer MUST be updated."&nbsp;  Could you add some rationale for why this<br>is needed?&nbsp; I suspect that part of my confusion is that the "locally calculated network state<br>hash" could mean two different things.&nbsp; Is it the hash computed by the local node on the<br>data received in the Network State TLV to validate that the Network State TLV is not<br>corrupted?&nbsp; Or is it the hash computed by the local node on its arbitrarily wide 1-hash tree<br>that represents the local node's network state?&nbsp;  Since the term is never defined, it's hard<br>to guess here.&nbsp; The bottom of Sec 7.2.2 uses "current locally calculated network state hash"<br>to refer to, I believe, the latter.<br><br>13) In Sec 6.2: "normally form peer relationships with all peers."&nbsp; Where is forming a peer<br>relationship defined?&nbsp; Is this tied solely to Trickle instances?&nbsp; What about with reliable unicast <br>where presumably Trickle isn't used between peers as the Overview states<br>"If used in pure unicast mode with unreliable transport, Trickle is also used between peers"?<br><br>14) In Sec 7: "&nbsp;  For example, type=123 (0x7b) TLV with value 'x' (120 = 0x78) is<br>&nbsp;  encoded as: 007B 0001 7800 0000.&nbsp; If it were to have sub-TLV of<br>&nbsp;  type=124 (0x7c) with value 'y', it would be encoded as 007B 0009 7800<br>&nbsp;  0000 007C 0001 7900 0000."&nbsp;  In this case, the padding between the TLV's value<br>and the sub-TLV is included but the padding after the sub-TLV is not.&nbsp; What would<br>happen if there were multiple sub-TLVs??&nbsp; Would the padding between those sub-TLVs<br>be included?<br><br>Also related :"In this case the length field includes the length of the original TLV, the <br>length of the padding that are inserted before the embedded TLVs and the length of the <br>added TLVs."&nbsp; Here, the phrase "length of the TLV" means different things.&nbsp; In the first case,<br>"length of the original TLV" means the "length of the value in the encapsulating TLV".&nbsp; In<br>the second case, "length of the added TLVs" appears to mean the length of the sub-TLVs <br>including the type/length header.&nbsp; As I mentioned above, I can't tell what happens to the <br>padding in between sub-TLVs.</div></td>

Homenet was chartered to produce standards track work, and this is a fundamental building block for HNCP. DNCP could be used for other work in the IETF, and is based upon other standards track building blocks (<a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a>). One of the reasons for separating DNCP out of HNCP, was for possible integration in Anima. Related work to DNCP (<a href="/doc/rfc7503/">RFC 7503</a> which was spun out of Homenet, and <a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a> on which DNCP is based) are both standards track RFCs.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>This document describes the Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP), a generic state synchronization protocol which uses Trickle and Merkle trees.&nbsp; DNCP is transport agnostic and leaves some of the details to be specified in profiles, which define actual implementable DNCP based protocols.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>The earliest roots of DNCP are in <a href="/doc/draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig/00/">draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-00</a> (Oct 2011) which led to <a href="/doc/draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig/00/">draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-00</a> and was published as Standards Track <a href="/doc/rfc7503/">RFC 7503</a>,&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment/00/">draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-00</a> (April 2012), “Trickle” as defined in Standards Track <a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a>, and HNCP first defined in draft-stenberg-homenet-hncp-00. DNCP in its current form was split from HNCP for the sake of modularity and reuse. Thus the work that ultimately led to this document evolved roughly through three major iterations before reaching draft-ietf-homenet-dncp-00. Last call had mostly minor issues brought up, which were addressed. <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>Yes, one open source project at <a href="https://github.com/sbyx/hnetd/">https://github.com/sbyx/hnetd/</a> and project homepage at <a href="http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php">http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php</a>.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br><br>The open source implementation (hnetd daemon) has been a part of routing feed of OpenWrt since Barrier Breaker (14.07) release in July, 2014.<br><br>Google Nest, Comcast Xfinity, D-Link, Freebox, Technicolor, and Cisco have all expressed interest in implementing and/or shipping HNCP, which relies upon DNCP. HNCP (and thereby DNCP) is referenced in version 1.0 of the Thread Specification (Nest, Samsung, etc.)<br><br>“Homenet” running either the early OSPF version and later HNCP (with DNCP) has been demonstrated publicly at:<br><br>8 IETF BnB events<br>1 CES Event in Las Vegas<br>3 IPv6 World Congress<br>1 Cablelabs Meeting<br><br>Are there any reviewers that&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>No particular Dr. reviews. I believe there has been a special request for review by the newly formed Routing Area Design Team regarding homenet, but have not seen the result. Brian Carpenter reviewed on behalf of Anima. Mikael Abrahamsson and Juliusz Chroboczek provided substantive review and comments as well.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>Mark Townsley<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>Terry Manderson<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>Document Shepherd performed a review just after last call, provided comments (mostly editorial) which have been addressed in the latest revision. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>Considering the entire life of the technology and open source development, I am very comfortable with the technical aspects. I would welcome more review for readability and consistency with the HNCP and other Homenet specifications as they have been through quite a bit of shuffling to get the right modules lined up with the right documents.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>The optional “certificate-based trust consensus” security scheme could use additional review by a security expert. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No such specific concerns or issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Email sent to authors on Friday, June 5 asking them to confirm explicitly that there is no IPR they are aware of.<br>Steven Barth and Markus Stenberg affirmed - waiting on Pierre Pfister<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>When HNCP and DNCP were created, the whole of the WG understood their purpose and exhibited strong consensus. As time has passed and “Big Decisions” turned to “Hard Work”, reliance upon a few individuals writing open source code has emerged. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Not with DNCP, no.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>The document does not intend to change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>Confirm all of the above.<br><br>Note for RFC Editor - under further review the text of the IANA section needs some improvement by copying and/or moving normative text regarding use of certain ranges of TLV types into section 7 (the TLV definition). <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>IANA will have one registry to setup for DNCP TLV types as outlined in the IANA Considerations section.<br><br>While DNCP is designed to be generally useful, its first usage is within Homenet (specifically HNCP) so any Expert Reviewer should be familiar with the work in the Homenet WG. Either the chairs, or other active and willing participants. <br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>

One of the reasons for separating DNCP out of HNCP, was for possible integration in Anima. Related work to DNCP (<a href="/doc/rfc7503/">RFC 7503</a> which was spun out of Homenet, and <a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a> on which DNCP is based) are both standards track RFCs.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>This document describes the Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP), a generic state synchronization protocol which uses Trickle and Merkle trees.&nbsp; DNCP is transport agnostic and leaves some of the details to be specified in profiles, which define actual implementable DNCP based protocols.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>The earliest roots of DNCP are in <a href="/doc/draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig/00/">draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-00</a> (Oct 2011) which led to <a href="/doc/draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig/00/">draft-acee-ospf-ospfv3-autoconfig-00</a> and was published as Standards Track <a href="/doc/rfc7503/">RFC 7503</a>,&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment/00/">draft-arkko-homenet-prefix-assignment-00</a> (April 2012), “Trickle” as defined in Standards Track <a href="/doc/rfc6206/">RFC 6206</a>, and HNCP first defined in draft-stenberg-homenet-hncp-00. DNCP in its current form was split from HNCP for the sake of modularity and reuse. Thus the work that ultimately led to this document evolved roughly through three major iterations before reaching draft-ietf-homenet-dncp-00. Last call had mostly minor issues brought up, which were addressed. <br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>Yes, one open source project at <a href="https://github.com/sbyx/hnetd/">https://github.com/sbyx/hnetd/</a> and project homepage at <a href="http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php">http://www.homewrt.org/doku.php</a>.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification?<br><br>The open source implementation (hnetd daemon) has been a part of routing feed of OpenWrt since Barrier Breaker (14.07) release in July, 2014.<br><br>Google Nest, Comcast Xfinity, D-Link, Freebox, Technicolor, and Cisco have all expressed interest in implementing and/or shipping HNCP, which relies upon DNCP. HNCP (and thereby DNCP) is referenced in version 1.0 of the Thread Specification (Nest, Samsung, etc.)<br><br>“Homenet” running either the early OSPF version and later HNCP (with DNCP) has been demonstrated publicly at:<br><br>8 IETF BnB events<br>1 CES Event in Las Vegas<br>3 IPv6 World Congress<br>1 Cablelabs Meeting<br><br>Are there any reviewers that&nbsp; merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>No particular Dr. reviews. I believe there has been a special request for review by the newly formed Routing Area Design Team regarding homenet, but have not seen the result. Brian Carpenter reviewed on behalf of Anima. Mikael Abrahamsson and Juliusz Chroboczek provided substantive review and comments as well.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br><br>Mark Townsley<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>Terry Manderson<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>Document Shepherd performed a review just after last call, provided comments (mostly editorial) which have been addressed in the latest revision. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br><br>Considering the entire life of the technology and open source development, I am very comfortable with the technical aspects. I would welcome more review for readability and consistency with the HNCP and other Homenet specifications as they have been through quite a bit of shuffling to get the right modules lined up with the right documents.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>The optional “certificate-based trust consensus” security scheme could use additional review by a security expert. <br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No such specific concerns or issues.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Email sent to authors on Friday, June 5 asking them to confirm explicitly that there is no IPR they are aware of.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>When HNCP and DNCP were created, the whole of the WG understood their purpose and exhibited strong consensus. As time has passed and “Big Decisions” turned to “Hard Work”, reliance upon a few individuals writing open source code has emerged. <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Not with DNCP, no.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All are RFCs.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>None.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>The document does not intend to change the status of any existing RFC.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>Confirm all of the above.<br><br>Note for RFC Editor - under further review the text of the IANA section needs some improvement by copying and/or moving normative text regarding use of certain ranges of TLV types into section 7 (the TLV definition). <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>IANA will have one registry to setup for DNCP TLV types as outlined in the IANA Considerations section.<br><br>While DNCP is designed to be generally useful, its first usage is within Homenet (specifically HNCP) so any Expert Reviewer should be familiar with the work in the Homenet WG. Either the chairs, or other active and willing participants. <br><br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A<br></div></td>
