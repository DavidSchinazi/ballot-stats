Maybe it is not harmful although it <br>might tend to reduce innovation and give vendors and operators<br>expectations about mechanisms that should be used within<br>implementations.<br><br>I find the final bullet very suspect. It goes beyond an implementation<br>report and enters into the world of sales. While the document makes no<br>explicit analysis of the pros and cons of the different implementations,<br>described, there is a lot between the lines. Furthermore, by not<br>documenting the mechanisms in other implementations, the document gives<br>the false impression that the three implementations described are the<br>benchmark for AS migration. It might be possible to move this material <br>to an appendix or a separate implementation document, but as the authors<br>note, much or all of the information can be found on the websites of the<br>companies concerned, and I think that is where it should stay.<br><br>[Please note that twice, while typing this, I wrote "AD migration".

When<br>&nbsp; explaining the features, CE-A and CE-B are used instead.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; It would make it easier to follow if the same names were used.<br><br>o Potential loops!&nbsp; Using "local-as no-prepend replace-as" results in <br>&nbsp; eliminating an ASN from the AS_PATH (in the example, the Old_ADN<br>&nbsp; 64510 is eliminated). If other routers in ISP B have not been migrated<br>&nbsp; yet (very real possibility) then they may accept Updates that already<br>&nbsp; went through their ASN (64510) resulting in potential loops.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; To be fair, the text suggests that ISP B has been migrated to the<br>&nbsp; New_ASN before applying the "local-as no-prepend replace-as" config,<br>&nbsp; but I think that it would be important to describe the potential <br>&nbsp; risk of using this feature - either as an Operational Consideration<br>&nbsp; or in the Security section.<br><br>o The text uses "MY ASN" to indicate the ASN number in the BGP<br>&nbsp; Open Message.&nbsp; However, (1) there is no reference to <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">rfc4271</a> so that<br>&nbsp; the reader understand what they're talking about, and (2) the field in<br>&nbsp; the Open message is called "My Autonomous System" (not MY ASN).<br>&nbsp; This shows up in 3.3 and 4.2.<br><br>o Also in 3.3 (and 4.2), the Error Message "BAD PEER AS" is mentioned..<br>&nbsp; Again, no reference and wrong name.&nbsp; The name used in <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">rfc4271</a> is<br> "Bad Peer AS".&nbsp; <br><br>o Other <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">rfc4271</a> related nits..&nbsp; The draft talks about "updates", but the<br>&nbsp; official name is "UPDATE".&nbsp; Yes, maybe OCD, but I think it is <br>&nbsp; important to be clear about what is being specified.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; In some cases the use is mixed: "..it MUST process the update as<br>&nbsp; normal, but it MUST append the configured ASN in the AS_PATH attribute<br>&nbsp; before advertising the UPDATE".<br><br>o In 3.3 (last paragraph) the authors talk about the CLI implementation.<br><br>&nbsp;  While the exact command syntax is an implementation detail beyond the<br>&nbsp;  scope of this document, the following consideration may be helpful<br>&nbsp;  for implementers<br><br>&nbsp; Suggest to stay out of this completely. It is nested "may" and that <br>&nbsp; really calls its value into question.<br><br>o Because the external features (Section 3) assumes that the AS being<br>&nbsp; migrated is already using the New_ASN before using local-as, I would<br>&nbsp; like to see the internal features (Section 4) be discussed first in <br>&nbsp; the text to keep a logical flow.<br><br>o 4.1: s/typically to PE devices/typically connected to PE devices</div></td>

Folk in the working group seem to agree, and the partner document in IDR (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/03/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration-03</a>) is moving forward at this time as well.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The document shepherd does not harbor any concerns about this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>I believe the parts of this document which require specialized review have been reviewed. That review was done by IDR folk during the working group work on that document as well.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>The WG consensus appears to be solid for this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.
