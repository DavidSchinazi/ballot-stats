I've noted several instances<br>in the comments (mostly tagged with "nit"), as well as some more<br>substantive comments.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  UDP-based protocols such as NTP are generally more<br>&nbsp;  susceptible to spoofing attacks then other connection-oriented<br>&nbsp;  protocols.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: was this intended to be "other, connection-oriented, protocols"?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NTP control messages can generate a lot of data in<br>&nbsp;  response to a small query, which makes it more attractive as a vector<br>&nbsp;  for distributed denial-of-service attacks.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: more attractive than what?&nbsp; (I.e., maybe just "makes it attractive")<br><br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc2827/">RFC2827</a>] was approved in 2000 to address this.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: maybe, "BCP 38 was published in 2000 to provide some level of<br>remediation against address-spoofing attacks"?<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It is RECOMMENDED that<br>&nbsp;  large corporate networks (and ISP's of any size) implement ingress<br>&nbsp;  and egress filtering.&nbsp; More information is available at the <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP38</a><br>&nbsp;  Info Web page [BCP38INFO] .<br><br><a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> already makes this recommendation, and the current document is<br>supposedly scoped to just NTP, so I would have expected wording more like<br>"It is recommended that [...] that use NTP implement ingress and egress<br>filtering.", if we can even be clear about who this directive is supposed<br>to apply to.<br><br>Section 3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Many network security mechanisms rely on time as part of their<br>&nbsp;  operation.&nbsp; If attackers can spoof the time, they may be able to<br>&nbsp;  bypass or neutralize other security elements.&nbsp; For example, incorrect<br>&nbsp;  time can disrupt the ability to reconcile logfile entries on the<br>&nbsp;  affected system with events on other systems.&nbsp; An application which<br>&nbsp;  is secure today could be insecure tomorrow once an unknown bug (or a<br>&nbsp;  known behavior) is exploited in the right way.&nbsp; Even our definition<br>&nbsp;  of what is secure has evolved over the years, so code which was<br>&nbsp;  considered secure when it was written may turn out to be insecure<br>&nbsp;  after some time.<br><br>The first three sentences seem related, but the last two sentences seem to<br>be talking about something qualitatively different (namely, "more<br>vulnerabilities being discovered over time", compared to the original's<br>"accurate time is important for secure and correct operation").&nbsp; I would<br>suggest a paragraph break and some transitional language.<br><br>Section 3.2<br><br>&nbsp;  But even with 4 or more sources of time, systemic problems can<br>&nbsp;  happen.&nbsp; For several hours before and after the June 2015 leap<br>&nbsp;  second, several operators implemented leap smearing while others did<br>&nbsp;  not, and many NTP end nodes could not determine an accurate time<br>&nbsp;  source because 2 of their 4 sources of time gave them consistent UTC/<br>&nbsp;  POSIX time, while the other 2 gave them consistent leap-smeared time.<br>&nbsp;  See Section 3.7.1 for more information.<br><br>&nbsp;  Operators SHOULD monitor all of the time sources that are in use.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  time sources do not generally agree, find out the cause and either<br>&nbsp;  correct the problems or stop using defective servers.&nbsp; See<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.5 for more information.<br><br>nit: the transition here is a bit odd.&nbsp; I would suggest either introducing<br>leap second smearing as a separate concept first (e.g., by<br>forward-reference to Section 3.7), or making the second quoted paragraph<br>mention that leap second smearing is one of many potential causes for<br>disagreement amongst time sources.<br><br>Section 3.3<br><br>nit: the Q&amp;A style in the second paragraph is not something I usually<br>expect to read in a BCP.<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Used improperly, these facilities can be an<br>&nbsp;  abuse vector.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I think (but am not 100% sure) that it's an attack vector on the server<br>itself, as well as an abuse vector.<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>The <a href="/doc/bcp38/">BCP 38</a> recommendation was already made above; do we really need to<br>duplicate it here?<br><br>Section 3.5<br><br>&nbsp;  If a system starts getting unexpected time replies from its time<br>&nbsp;  servers, that can be an indication that the IP address of the system<br>&nbsp;  is being forged in requests to its time server.&nbsp; The goal of this<br>&nbsp;  attack is to convince the time server to stop serving time to the<br>&nbsp;  system whose address is being forged.<br><br>nit: the writing here could probably be tightened up.&nbsp; E.g., things like<br>"NTP reply packets that do not correspond requests it sent", "an attacker<br>is forging its IP address in requests to the time server", and "one reason<br>an attacker would do so could be to convince the time server to".<br><br>&nbsp;  If a server's system log shows messages that indicates it is<br>&nbsp;  receiving timestamps that are earlier than the current system time,<br>&nbsp;  then either the system clock is unusually fast or somebody is trying<br>&nbsp;  to launch a replay attack against that server.<br><br>Is "receiving timestamps" supposed to be for NTP messages in particular, or<br>all general syslog traffic?<br><br>Section 4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc5905/">RFC5905</a>] specifies a hash which must be supported for calculation of<br>&nbsp;  the MAC, but other algorithms may be supported as well.&nbsp; The MD5 hash<br>&nbsp;  is now considered to be too weak.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>nit: "too weak" for what?&nbsp; (Maybe "considered to be weak and unsuitable for<br>cryptographic usage" would be better, with a reference to <a href="/doc/rfc6151/">RFC 6151</a> or<br>similar.<br><br>&nbsp;  To use this approach the communication partners have to exchange the<br>&nbsp;  key, which consists of a keyid with a value between 1 and 65534,<br>&nbsp;  inclusive, and a label which indicates the chosen digest algorithm.<br><br>Surely there is also the actual cryptographic key material itself!<br><br>&nbsp;  Each communication partner adds this information to its own key file.<br><br>Does the reader know what a "key file" is at this point in the document?<br>(Alternately, is "key file" an implementation detail and not a protocol<br>concept?)<br><br>&nbsp;  Some implementations store the key in clear text.&nbsp; Therefore it<br>&nbsp;  SHOULD only be readable by the NTP process.&nbsp; Different keys are added<br>&nbsp;  line by line to the key file.<br><br>Similarly here; the "key file" is only vaguely and implicitly described<br>(and the line-by-line format is clearly implementation-specific); the main<br>actionable point here is just to ensure that it is only readable to the NTP<br>process and the rest could, I think, be safely omitted.<br><br>&nbsp;  An NTP client establishes a protected association by appending the<br>&nbsp;  key to the server statement in its configuration file.&nbsp; Note that the<br>&nbsp;  NTP process has to trust the applied key.<br><br>If the configuration file format is not standardized, there's not much<br>useful for us to say here about its contents.&nbsp; Also, what does "has to<br>trust" mean?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>The reference is provided only for the attack on autokey but not for<br>autokey itself.&nbsp; Is there a stable reference for the autokey protocol (so<br>that people know what to not use)?<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NTP control<br>&nbsp;  queries also leak important information (including reference ID,<br>&nbsp;  expected origin timestamp, etc.) that may be used in attacks<br>&nbsp;  [CVE-2015-8139].&nbsp; A remote attacker can learn this information by<br>&nbsp;  sending control queries to a target system and inspecting the<br>&nbsp;  response.<br><br>Er, so is it the control *query* that leaks information, or the response to<br>that query?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  It is recommended that operators SHOULD filter mode 3 queries<br>&nbsp;  at the edge, or make sure mode 3 queries are allowed only from<br>&nbsp;  trusted systems or networks.<br><br>nit: "at the edge" is not a well-defined concept here.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note well that proper monitoring of an NTP server instance includes<br>&nbsp;  checking the time of that NTP server instance.<br><br>Perhaps more explicitly state that the above recommendations for leaf hosts<br>preclude such monitoring [of leaf hosts]?<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>Do we want to say anything about what to do when a (potential) attack is<br>detected (e.g., make an entry in the system log)?<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>It seems worth reiterating that these KoD packets will be accepted in<br>common usage even when not cryptographically authenticated, which makes the<br>DoS risk more severe.<br><br>I am not sure whether the note about KoD packets indicating potential<br>attacks is better here or in the previous subsection.<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br>This is entirely editorial (and thus your preferences outweigh mine), but<br>if I were writing this I would say something like "an up-to-date and secure<br>NTP implementation" rather than "the latest NTP updates applied".<br><br>Section 7<br><br>Would it ever make sense to have multiple (disjoint?) anycast pools so that<br>clients could still benefit from having multiple servers concurrently<br>available to compare?<br><br>Appendix A.*<br><br>It would be helpful to distinguish which strings are literal syntax<br>that must be used unchanged and which strings are supposed to be<br>user-replaceable.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header?<br><br>BCP - This document provides best practices for the operation of NTP servers and clients on the Internet. Some of these best practices are vital for reducing some of the problems NTP has caused (e.g. amplification attacks) and as such it should be considered a BCP. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary: <br><br>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet and has been widely used since its initial publication.&nbsp; This document is a collection of Best Practices for general operation of NTP servers and clients on the Internet.&nbsp; It includes recommendations for stable, accurate and secure operation of NTP infrastructure.&nbsp; This document is targeted at NTP version 4 as<br>described in <a href="/doc/rfc5905/">RFC 5905</a>. <br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document has clear working group consensus for publication, and has been reviewed by several WG participants since its initial adoption as a working group item. <br><br>Document Quality:<br> <br>This document has been reviewed and revised several times during its development. There were no specific external expert reviews conducted beyond those conducted during the IETF Last Call and IESG level reviews. <br> <br>Personnel: <br><br>Karen O'Donoghue is acting as the Document Shepherd.  Suresh Krishnan is the Responsible Area Director. <br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG.<br> <br>The document shepherd has followed the working group process and reviewed the final document and feels this document is ready for IESG review. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br> <br>The document shepherd does not have any concerns about the reviews that were performed. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place.<br><br>This document does not require any special reviews beyond those planned during the IESG review process. <br> <br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here.<br> <br>The Document Shepherd is comfortable with this document as a long overdue articulation of best practices for NTP. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>The authors have confirmed that they have dealt with all appropriate IPR disclosures.<br> <br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br><br>There is no IPR disclosures for this document. <br> <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document represents strong WG consensus. <br> <br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. <br><br>There have been no threats of anyone appealing the documents.<br> <br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>idnits 2.16.01 <br>/tmp/draft-ietf-ntp-bcp-10.txt:<br>Summary: 0 errors (**), 0 flaws (~~), 0 warnings (==), 12 comments (--).<br><br>There are no errors, flaws, or warnings in this version of the document. All the comments are related to URLs used as references in the document. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>There are no formal review criteria for this document. <br> <br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative?<br><br>All references are tagged as normative or informative. <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>All normative references are completed.<br> <br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure.<br><br>There are no downward normative references. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs. <br> <br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>There are no new IANA considerations contained in this document. <br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>There are no new IANA considerations contained in this document. <br> <br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>There are no formal language sections in this document.<br><br><br></div></td>
