So Section 3.3 says:<br><br>&nbsp;  Source port:&nbsp; A source port selected by the originating tunnel<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endpoint.&nbsp; This source port SHOULD be the same for all packets<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; belonging to a single encapsulated flow to prevent reordering due<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the use of different paths.&nbsp; To encourage an even distribution<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of flows across multiple links, the source port SHOULD be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calculated using a hash of the encapsulated packet headers using,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for example, a traditional 5-tuple.&nbsp; Since the port represents a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flow identifier rather than a true UDP connection, the entire<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16-bit range MAY be used to maximize entropy.<br><br>I think using the different source ports to enable flow hashing is a nice idea. However, I am a bit worried over the implications of using the full 16-bit range without caveats. Specifically in cases where a network error or other failure to forward the Geneve encapsulated packet and that result in any form a return traffic towards the tunnel ingress. Such as ICMP Packet Too Big messages or Port / Host unreachable. These messages needs to be consumed by the Geneve tunneling endpoint to affect the right response to them. However, if the source port is corresponding to any port where there exist a listenser or bi-directional server on the tunnel ingress host, such as SSH, Echo etc. the ICMP messages may be consumed by the wrong entity that only filter on source port and not the destination port. <br><br>I believe this issue may require at least a explicit consideration in the document.<br><br>Otherwise thanks for thinking through many transport issues for tunnels.</div></td>

I've read the discussion at<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/last-call/ywRKREnxWAlunHR7MSaTM4ScsDs">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/last-call/ywRKREnxWAlunHR7MSaTM4ScsDs</a><br>but I'm left with a similar sense of uncertainty that Daniel has as to<br>whether the question is fully resolved.&nbsp; Specifically, "the question"<br>that I have in mind is to what extent the Geneve architecture includes<br>support for middleboxes that inspect (but do not modify!) the Geneve<br>header and inner payload, to what extent the Geneve architecture is<br>intended to be applicable to scenarios where (end-to-end per-tunnel)<br>underlay confidentiality protection is necessary, and whether those<br>requirements are both strong enough to be deemed an internal<br>inconsistency of requirements/applicability.&nbsp; "Interposing advanced<br>middleboxes" and "service interposition" are conceived as possible uses<br>for Geneve metadata in Sections 1 and 2.2 as a consideration for why<br>structured tagging is needed on the data plane and not just the control<br>plane, which to me suggests that such usage is considered a first-class<br>use case for Geneve.&nbsp; Section 6.1.1 discusses encryption for traffic<br>traversing untrusted links between geographically separated data<br>centers (though perhaps in this case an encrypted tunnel would be used<br>just for that untrusted transit and leaving the in-datacenter traffic<br>visible to middleboxes), but Section 6.1 discusses cases where the tenant<br>may expect the service provider to provide confidentiality as part of<br>the service.&nbsp; Would this be above or below the Geneve encapsulation?<br>Might some customers insist on one or the other?&nbsp; The consideration from<br>Section 6.1 that the provider of the underlay and the provider of the<br>overlay may not be the same could be taken to imply that the overlay<br>provider itself wants (cryptographic) protection from the underlay<br>provider.&nbsp; I don't have a clear picture of how these considerations<br>interact.&nbsp; (I also note that, since DTLS is mentioned, DTLS 1.3 is going<br>the way of TLS 1.3 and not defining any authentication-only<br>ciphersuites, so if authentication-only service is desired, DTLS may not<br>be the way of the future, leaving IPsec AH as the leading candidate.)<br><br>Some other section-by-section discuss-level points follow, mostly<br>self-contained/localized issues.<br><br>Section 3.5.1<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; Some options may be defined in such a way that the position in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; option list is significant.&nbsp; Options MUST NOT be changed by<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transit devices.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; An option SHOULD NOT be dependent upon any other option in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; packet, i.e., options can be processed independently of one<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; another.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As was already noted, I don't see how these two requirements are<br>self-consistent.<br><br>&nbsp;  size.&nbsp; A particular option is specified to have either a fixed<br>&nbsp;  length, which is constant, or a variable length, which may change<br>&nbsp;  over time or for different use cases.&nbsp; This property is part of the<br>&nbsp;  definition of the option and conveyed by the 'Type'.&nbsp; For fixed<br><br>This text is written as if this specification is going to specify<br>further substructure for the "Type", with respect to certain types that<br>have fixed length and others that may vary.&nbsp; Otherwise the property<br>would be attached to the option value and not the type value, in my<br>understanding.&nbsp; With the current way the registry is laid out it seems<br>like we need to explicitly say that the entity allocating the option<br>class value needs to specify the interpretation of the 'type' field when<br>used with that option class.<br><br>Section 4.3.1<br><br>&nbsp;  2.&nbsp; If Geneve is used with zero UDP checksum over IPv6 then such<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  tunnel endpoint implementation MUST meet all the requirements<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  specified in section 4 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC6936</a>] and requirements 1 as<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  specified in section 5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC6936</a>].<br><br>This seems to implicitly be saying that the other numbered requirements<br>in Section 5 of <a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC 6936</a> can be ignored, which is updating the behavior<br>of a standards-track document.&nbsp; We need to either be explicit about the<br>update or justify why (the rest of) that applicability statement is not<br>applicable here.&nbsp; If, as the paragraph following the enumerated list<br>says, the requirements specified in <a href="/doc/rfc6936/">RFC 6936</a> continue to apply in full,<br>why do we need to call out a MUST-level requirement here?<br><br>&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; The Geneve tunnel endpoint that encapsulates the tunnel MAY use<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  different IPv6 source addresses for each Geneve tunnel that uses<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Zero UDP checksum mode in order to strengthen the decapsulator's<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  check of the IPv6 source address (i.e the same IPv6 source<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address is not to be used with more than one IPv6 destination<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  address, irrespective of whether that destination address is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  unicast or multicast address).&nbsp; When this is not possible, it is<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RECOMMENDED to use each source address for as few Geneve tunnels<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that use zero UDP checksum as is feasible.<br><br>This functionality is not usable without some mechanism to signal from<br>encapsulator to decapsulator that it is in use.<br><br>&nbsp;  The requirement to check the source IPv6 address in addition to the<br>&nbsp;  destination IPv6 address, [...]<br><br>I do not see this specified as a requirement, only a MAY-level<br>suggestion.<br><br>Section 4.6<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; When performing LSO, a NIC MUST replicate the entire Geneve header<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and all options, including those unknown to the device, onto each<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; resulting segment.&nbsp; However, a given option definition may<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; override this rule and specify different behavior in supporting<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devices.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>This second sentence makes the MUST in the first no longer a MUST.</div></td>

 recipient.&nbsp; As new functionality becomes sufficiently well defined to<br>&nbsp;  add to tunnel endpoints, supporting options can be designed using<br>&nbsp;  ordering restrictions and other techniques to ease parsing.<br><br>I'm having trouble parsing the second half of this sentence -- what does<br>"supporting options" mean as a noun?<br><br>&nbsp;  Further, either tunnel endpoints or transit devices MAY use offload<br>&nbsp;  capabilities of NICs such as checksum offload to improve the<br>&nbsp;  performance of Geneve packet processing.&nbsp; The presence of a Geneve<br>&nbsp;  variable length header SHOULD NOT prevent the tunnel endpoints and<br>&nbsp;  transit devices from using such offload capabilities.<br><br>I agree with the directorate reviewer that this implementation guidance<br>is unenforcable as normative keywords.<br><br>Section 3.1, 3.2<br><br>If we're going to give concrete values for the IPv4 protocol/IPv6<br>NextHeader (17) and destination port (6081), shouldn't we also use the<br>concreve value for Geneve protocol type (0x6558) that corresponds to the<br>inner ethernet frame?<br><br>I'd also suggest some visual distinction that the "Variable Length<br>Options" do in fact have variable length, perhaps using the '~'<br>character in vertical lines.<br>Similarly, the original ethernet payload need not be 4-byte-aligned and<br>the figure could make that more prominent.<br><br>It's a little awkward to expand FCS on second usage, not first usage.<br><br>Section 3.4<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The critical bit allows hardware implementations the flexibility<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to handle options processing in the hardware fastpath or in the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exception (slow) path without the need to process all the options.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, a critical option such as secure hash to provide<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Geneve header integrity check must be processed by tunnel<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; endpoints and typically processed in the hardware fastpath.<br><br>I think I'm failing to make a connection between some of these steps.<br>How does having a critical bit let a header integrity check happen in<br>the hardware fastpath while deferring other option processing to<br>software?<br><br>&nbsp;  Transit devices MUST maintain consistent forwarding behavior<br>&nbsp;  irrespective of the value of 'Opt Len', including ECMP link<br>&nbsp;  selection.&nbsp; These devices SHOULD be able to forward packets<br>&nbsp;  containing options without resorting to a slow path.<br><br>There seem to be two broad aspects in play here.&nbsp; First, requiring<br>insensitivity to "Opt Len" might be because the value would change as a<br>packet traverses the network.&nbsp; I think this is forbidden by virtue of<br>transit devices not being allowed to add/delete options, but please<br>confirm.&nbsp; Second, this affects the ability of transit devices to look<br>past the geneve header to the inner ethernet header and payload.&nbsp; Given<br>the substantial discussion we've had in the broader IETF about IPv6<br>extension headers and the inability of hardware to examine such<br>variable-length chains to get to the actual upper layer protocol (with<br>the result that extension headers are largely unusuable on substantial<br>portions of the internet), it seems like we might conclude from this<br>statement that either we expect transit devices to not inspect the<br>upper-layer content or there's a significant chance that this<br>requirement will be ignored (possibly just by capping the 'Opt Len'<br>value that is supported), or both.&nbsp; What makes this setup different from<br>IPv6 EH such that we expect hardware compliance and a usable deployment?<br>This is particularly poigniant given that we claim this to be a<br>requirement on transit devices but allow (in Section 4.5) for endpoints<br>to use profiles that have a restricted maximum length for the options.<br>If such profiles are common, the incentive for transit devices to slip<br>and use the lower maximum length increases.<br><br>Section 3.5<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high order bit of the option type indicates that this is a<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; critical option.&nbsp; If the receiving tunnel endpoint does not<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recognize this option and this bit is set then the packet MUST be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dropped.&nbsp; If the 'C' bit (critical bit) is set in any option then<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the 'C' bit in the Geneve base header MUST also be set.&nbsp; Transit<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; devices MUST NOT drop packets on the basis of this bit.&nbsp; The<br><br>nit: since we mention the Geneve header, one might claim that "this bit"<br>in "MUST NOT drop packets on the basis of this bit" is ambiguous (but<br>since we said this before for the Geneve header one, I assume we're<br>talking about the one in the Type field now).<br><br>Section 4.4.1<br><br>&nbsp;  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that Path MTU Discovery ([<a href="/doc/rfc1191/">RFC1191</a>],<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8201/">RFC8201</a>]) be used by setting the DF bit in the IP header when Geneve<br>&nbsp;  packets are transmitted over IPv4 (this is the default with IPv6).<br><br>Is it the default or the only specified behavior for IPv6?<br><br>Section 4.4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  outside of the scope of this document.&nbsp; When physical multicast is in<br>&nbsp;  use, the 'C' bit in the Geneve header may be used with groups of<br>&nbsp;  devices with heterogeneous capabilities as each device can interpret<br>&nbsp;  only the options that are significant to it if they are not critical.<br><br>Please double-check this sentence, particularly the "may be used".&nbsp; If<br>the intent is, as written, to note that the packets with the 'C' bit set<br>might take paths with heterogenous paths, I suggest being more explicit<br>about the consequences that the traffic might only be delivered to some<br>but not all endpoints.<br><br>Section 6<br><br>&nbsp;  untrusted boundaries.&nbsp; In addition, tunnel endpoints should only be<br>&nbsp;  operated in environments controlled by the service provider, such as<br>&nbsp;  the hypervisor itself rather than within a customer VM.<br><br>Can you say a bit more about how this "should only be operated in<br>environments controlled by the service provider" meshes with the note in<br>Section 4.1 that "[i]t is intended for use in public or private data<br>center environments" (specifically the "public data center" portion) and<br>the note in Section 6.1 that the provider of the overlay may not be the<br>same as the provider of the underlay?<br><br>Section 6.1.1<br><br>&nbsp;  traversing public networks.&nbsp; Any Geneve overlay data leaving the data<br>&nbsp;  center network beyond the operator's security domain SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  secured by encryption mechanisms such as IPsec or other VPN<br>&nbsp;  mechanisms to protect the communications between the NVEs when they<br>&nbsp;  are geographically separated over untrusted network links.<br><br>Since we use "mechanisms" in both the IPsec clause and the "other VPN"<br>clause, the "encryption" does not automatically bind to both clauses<br>from a grammatical perspective.&nbsp; Given that "VPN" is currently in use<br>for both encrypted and non-encrypted schemes (much to my chagrin),<br>please clarify that the other VPN mechanisms also need to provide<br>cryptographic confidentiality protection.&nbsp;

Are all future option types in the 0x0000..0x00FF range expected to be specified in a single separate document? If not, that should be clarified. I also think there needs to be a normative requirement that such future specifications define all of the types associated with the option classes.<br><br>In the registry defined in Section 7, I think the table needs a column for the document to reference for each option class definition. That way when option classes are defined in the 0x0000..0x00FF range, implementers and operators will be able to find the reference and understand the semantics of the types. For the vendor-specific options this can be optional, but still would be nice to list if such documentation exists.</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a<br>&nbsp;  wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel<br>&nbsp;  endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  result of their role in tying together different elements in the<br>&nbsp;  system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these<br>&nbsp;  components.&nbsp; Flexibility is therefore the most important aspect of a<br>&nbsp;  tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of the<br>&nbsp;  system.&nbsp; This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol<br>&nbsp;  designed to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and<br>&nbsp;  needs.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document describes the Geneve encapsulation format for NVO3. NVO3<br>&nbsp;  has considered many different encapsulation formats, also including GUE <br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-gue/05/">draft-ietf-nvo3-gue-05</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-gue/07/">draft-ietf-intarea-gue-07</a>), and VXLAN-GPE<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/06/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-06</a>). A design team was chartered to analyse<br>&nbsp;  the available encapsulations and recommend one to go forward. The<br>&nbsp;  result of this choice was Geneve, and the design team's conclusions<br>&nbsp;  are documented in draft-dt-nvo3-encap-01. These conclusions were<br>&nbsp;  accepted by the working group. <br><br>&nbsp;  There are two IPR declarations on the draft. These were made in 2014 prior to<br>&nbsp;  the draft being adopted as a working group draft, and the working group is <br>&nbsp;  well aware of these. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document. I believe it represents <br>&nbsp;  WG consensus, and it has been widely reviewed and discussed on the list over a <br>&nbsp;  number of years. The choice of Geneve by the NVO3 encapsulation design team and<br>&nbsp;  as confirmed by adoption by the working group. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The document has been the subject of early reviews by the Routing Area Directorate,<br>&nbsp;  Transport Area Review Team, and the Security Area Directorate. Although all<br>&nbsp;  of these review raise comments, they were all resolved with the agreement of<br>&nbsp;  the reviewers. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The document also received a significant number of comments from the editor of<br>&nbsp;  a number of security drafts in NVO3. Most of these were resolved, and all comments<br>&nbsp;  were addressed on the list or as changes to the document. The most significant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; outstanding comment related to the fact that Geneve recommends using DTLS and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IPSec for end to end security. This is not possible if transit devices that need to <br>&nbsp;  inspect the packet header. This limitation is indicated in the draft. There was<br>&nbsp;  also some discussion around the precise wording of restrictions on the order<br>&nbsp; of processing and dependencies between options in the Geneve header, but<br>&nbsp; no consensus to change the current text in the draft.<br>&nbsp;  There was consensus to move forward with the draft.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The document does not specify any MIB changes or additions which would need <br>&nbsp;  review.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd is Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@nokia.com">matthew.bocci@nokia.com</a>).<br>&nbsp;  The responsible Area Director is Martin Vigoureux (<a href="mailto:martin.vigoureux@nokia.com">martin.vigoureux@nokia.com</a>).<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp; The document shepherd reviewed v09 of the document. I had no significant technical <br>&nbsp; comments, but I did make some editorial comments that were resolved in<br>&nbsp; version 10. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>&nbsp; No concerns. The document has received adequate review with significant<br>&nbsp; discussion on the WG list. The document has <br>&nbsp; been developed within the WG and reviewed over a period of a number of IETFs. <br>&nbsp; The document has been the subject of early reviews by the Routing Area Directorate,<br>&nbsp;  Transport Area Review Team, and the Security Area Directorate. Although all<br>&nbsp;  of these review raise comments, they were all resolved with the agreement of<br>&nbsp;  the reviewers. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No further review required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp; No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  Each author listed in the Authors Addresses section has personally indicated that<br>&nbsp;  they are not aware of any IPR that has not already been declared in accordance<br>&nbsp;  with <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and 79.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are two IPR declarations on the draft. These were made in 2014 prior to<br>&nbsp;  the draft being adopted as a working group draft, and the working group is <br>&nbsp;  well aware of these. No concerns were raised during working group <br>&nbsp;  adoption or last call.<br><br><br>&nbsp; <br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am comfortable that the document represents WG consensus and has<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; been reviewed by a reasonable number of active WG participants. It received a <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; number of comments and significant discussion in WG last call that<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; were addressed by the authors. There were no objections during last call, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; comments were constructive and supportive of moving the draft forward. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to the WG last call, a call for interest was conducted which also demonstrated <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; consensus in the value of progressing the draft.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp; None indicated.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ID-Nits passes. There is one minor comment about and obsolete informational <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2460/">RFC 2460</a> (Obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc8200/">RFC 8200</a>). This is a case of an Internet <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Standard document obsoleting a Proposed Standard and can be fixed during the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; publication process. <br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no relevant formal review criteria.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp; Yes. All references are explicitly identified as informative or normative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp; No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br><br>&nbsp; No. <br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp; This document does not change the status of any existing RFCs.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  The document includes IANA actions. These are properly indicated.<br>&nbsp;  There is one requested allocation for a new UDP port (6081). This <br>&nbsp;  is already recorded in the appropriate IANA registry.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  There is also a request for the allocation of a new Geneve option<br>&nbsp;  class registry. This is properly indicated in the draft.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no new registries requiring Expert Review.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no sections containing formal language that needs reviewing.</div></td>

The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br><br>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a<br>&nbsp;  wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel<br>&nbsp;  endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.&nbsp; As a<br>&nbsp;  result of their role in tying together different elements in the<br>&nbsp;  system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these<br>&nbsp;  components.&nbsp; Flexibility is therefore the most important aspect of a<br>&nbsp;  tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of the<br>&nbsp;  system.&nbsp; This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol<br>&nbsp;  designed to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and<br>&nbsp;  needs.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp;  The document describes the Geneve encapsulation format for NVO3. NVO3<br>&nbsp;  has considered many different encapsulation formats, also including GUE <br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-gue/05/">draft-ietf-nvo3-gue-05</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-gue/07/">draft-ietf-intarea-gue-07</a>), and VXLAN-GPE<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/06/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-06</a>). A design team was chartered to analyse<br>&nbsp;  the available encapsulations and recommend one to go forward. The<br>&nbsp;  result of this choice was Geneve, and the design team's conclusions<br>&nbsp;  are documented in draft-dt-nvo3-encap-01. These conclusions were<br>&nbsp;  accepted by the working group. <br><br>&nbsp;  There are two IPR declarations on the draft. These were made in 2014 prior to<br>&nbsp;  the draft being adopted as a working group draft, and the working group is <br>&nbsp;  well aware of these. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document.

NVO3<br>&nbsp;  has considered many different encapsulation formats, also including GUE <br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-gue/05/">draft-ietf-nvo3-gue-05</a> and <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-intarea-gue/07/">draft-ietf-intarea-gue-07</a>), and VXLAN-GPE<br>&nbsp;  (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe/06/">draft-ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe-06</a>). A design team was chartered to analyse<br>&nbsp;  the available encapsulations and recommend one to go forward. The<br>&nbsp;  result of this choice was Geneve, and the design team's conclusions<br>&nbsp;  are documented in draft-dt-nvo3-encap-01. These conclusions were<br>&nbsp;  accepted by the working group. <br><br>&nbsp;  There are two IPR declarations on the draft. These were made in 2014 prior to<br>&nbsp;  the draft being adopted as a working group draft, and the working group is <br>&nbsp;  well aware of these. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;  I have no concerns about the quality of the document.

Although all<br>&nbsp;  of these review raise comments, they were all resolved with the agreement of<br>&nbsp;  the reviewers. <br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  The document also received a significant number of comments from the editor of<br>&nbsp;  a number of security drafts in NVO3. Most of these were resolved, and all comments<br>&nbsp;  were addressed on the list or as changes to the document. The most significant<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; outstanding comment related to the fact that Geneve recommends using DTLS and <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; IPSec for end to end security. This is not possible if transit devices that need to <br>&nbsp;  inspect the packet header.
