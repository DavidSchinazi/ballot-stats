In short: What are the costs and the benefits? Who<br>stands to gain, and who will pay a cost?<br><br>For example, in examining Section 2.1, it seems to me that there are<br>considerable benefits to the network provider, while the customer does <br>not get anything substantial that they don't already have. On the other<br>hand, it appears that it is the customer who would carry the cost of <br>this deployment approach.<br><br># In email Lori noted<br>#<br># That depends if it is the network provider who manages the CPE (like<br># residential cable/DSL), or it is the customer.&nbsp; In the former case, it<br># is the ISP that has to upgrade all devices, and it may not be in its<br># best interest.&nbsp; If it is the customer managing the router, the ISP <br># still doesn't get too many benefits IMO.<br>#<br># ...and I suggested including some text like this.<br><br>On the other hand, the approach in Section 2.2 places the cost with the<br>carrier. In this deployment it looks like the carrier gets quite a lot<br>of benefits, but the customer actually loses some function.<br><br>It would be really valuable for this document to tackle this head on.

Points that have been<br>addressed have been removed. New text is prefixed '#' <br><br>Thanks for the work so far.<br><br>---<br><br>This issue is border-line Discuss/Comment, but it is actionable, and it<br>is a matter of clarity and interaction with other documents, so I think<br>it is worth handling as a Discuss.<br><br>You are, I think, free to define terms for use within the scope of this<br>document, and given the title of the document, a clear definition of<br>"network element" is important.&nbsp; However, where Section 1 says...<br><br>&nbsp;  We formally define the following two terms:<br><br>&nbsp;  Network element:&nbsp; Active or passive device that is connected to other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; active or passive devices for transporting packet switched data.<br><br>... I think you need to explicitly scope the definition to this <br>document.&nbsp; The point here is that "network element" is an extremely <br>widely used term. It even has its own Wikipedia entry. And, sadly, the<br>common usage is not that close to the definition you have here (although<br>maybe you have defined a subset of the common usage). I think it is<br>important that you carefully disambiguate the term from the normal <br>meaning and set your scope to "within the document we define..."<br><br>As an aside, your current definition does not include end-systems. That<br>is nodes that source or consume packets since they do not "transport" see <br>those packets.&nbsp; Thus the definition of LISP Site as "A single host or a<br>set of network elements" does not seem to allow for "a set of hosts and<br>network elements".<br><br># In an email thread, Lori proposed to change to<br>#<br># Network element:&nbsp; facility or equipment used in the provision of a <br># communications service over the Internet.<br>#<br># I don't see that change. Maybe also including a citation for the <br># definition would be helpful.<br><br>---<br><br>It seems that there is a missing piece of discussion about what happens<br>when an ETR operator advertises stuff it shouldn't (e.g., to attract<br>traffic). This is policeable, but the policing function is a critical<br>part of the deployment model. It needs to be described.<br><br>The nearest discussion I could find to this was in 5.3, but it doesn't<br>go close to talking about the problem.<br><br>Of course, a chunk of this could easily be argued to be an operational<br>discussion that belongs in a separate document.&nbsp; I'd be OK with that, on<br>the whole, but there are surely some deployment considerations as well.<br>Which model is best able to protect against this? What are the<br>deployment concerns related to this problem?<br><br># This comment is related to an ETR operator attracting traffic by<br># overclaiming an EID-prefix and could be handled by a forward <br># reference to [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-threats/">I-D.ietf-lisp-threats</a>]&nbsp; (Section 4.4.3).</div></td>

I hope we can polish this document to make it more helpful to<br>network operators in explaining how they can choose between the<br>different deployment models.<br><br>---<br><br>This issue is border-line Discuss/Comment, but it is actionable, and it<br>is a matter of clarity and interaction with other documents, so I think<br>it is worth handling as a Discuss.<br><br>You are, I think, free to define terms for use within the scope of this<br>document, and given the title of the document, a clear definition of<br>"network element" is important.&nbsp; However, where Section 1 says...<br><br>&nbsp;  We formally define the following two terms:<br><br>&nbsp;  Network element:&nbsp; Active or passive device that is connected to other<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; active or passive devices for transporting packet switched data.<br><br>... I think you need to explicitly scope the definition to this <br>document.&nbsp; The point here is that "network element" is an extremely <br>widely used term. It even has its own Wikipedia entry. And, sadly, the<br>common usage is not that close to the definition you have here (although<br>maybe you have defined a subset of the common usage). I think it is<br>important that you carefully disambiguate the term from the normal <br>meaning and set your scope to "within the document we define..."<br><br>As an aside, your current definition does not include end-systems. That<br>is nodes that source or consume packets since they do not "transport"<br>those packets.&nbsp; Thus the definition of LISP Site as "A single host or a<br>set of network elements" does not seem to allow for "a set of hosts and<br>network elements".<br><br>---<br><br>I tried to correlate the LISP features shown in Section 2.6 with the<br>applications detailed in draft-ietf-lisp-introduction.&nbsp; In the latter I<br>found 7 principal applications (section 5) of which just one (Traffic<br>Engineering) appears in Section 2.6 of this document.<br><br>There are several possibilities here:<br>- I may be misunderstanding the terms used so that there is actually a <br>&nbsp; larger overlap than I am seeing (in which case some alignment of terms<br>&nbsp; would be handy)<br>- It might not be appropriate to compare the lists (which you could <br>&nbsp; explain to me in an email, and might result in a little text to <br>&nbsp; clarify the context of 2.6)<br>- <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-lisp-introduction/">draft-ietf-lisp-introduction</a> may be at a really early stage and so it<br>&nbsp; would be appropriate to update *that* document to be in synch with <br>&nbsp; this one.<br>- There may be some discussion of other features missing from this<br>&nbsp; document.<br><br>---<br><br>The Recursive Deployment Model<br><br>Reading Section 2.4 I found the recursive deployment model burried in <br>the text.&nbsp; I think that this is an important model that is mentioned in<br>several other documents and adds quite a lot of function for the <br>operator. So I believe that you should have a separate section <br>specifically for the recursive model.<br><br>(Note that even the table in Section 2.6 acknowledges the recursive model<br>as a deployment model.)<br><br>In particular how is the recursive model deployed, what are the <br>identifiers and what are the locators?<br><br>Perhaps a picture, too.<br><br>But this did raise for me the question of "Deployment Model or <br>Functional Model?"&nbsp; Clearly Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 are deployment<br>models.&nbsp; Similarly, a new section on the Recursive Model would be about<br>a deployment model. But the current Section 2.4 seems to be a functional<br>model, not a deployment model.<br><br>It would be helpful to separate deployment models from functional models<br>within the document.&nbsp; <br><br>---<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>I don't understand what happens when there is not enough global address<br>space for EIDs.&nbsp; The same question for RLOCs.&nbsp; And what if there is not<br>enough global address space for *both* EIDs and RLOCs?<br><br>Even if there is a simple answer to this question, it would be nice to<br>add a couple of lines to make it a bit easier for the deployer.<br><br>---<br><br>Root Operators<br><br>Section 3.1 seems to make a statement that DDT-like operation is to be<br>used to the exclusion of ALT.&nbsp; I don't (particularly) have a problem <br>with that, although it would be nice if this document was far clearer<br>about advising on the selection between these two modes.<br><br>&nbsp;  Participation in the mapping<br>&nbsp;  database, and the storing of EID-to-RLOC mapping data is subject to<br>&nbsp;  the policies of the "root" operators, who should check ownership<br>&nbsp;  rights for the EID prefixes stored in the database by participants.<br>&nbsp;  These policies are out of the scope of this document.<br><br>But I think there is quite a chunk missing in the document about what a<br>"root operator" is in the LISP context. In particular, how will a root<br>operator be selected in such deployments?<br><br>There is a tiny mention of this in Section 3.2, but surely this is a <br>major issue for deployment.&nbsp; How does a root get selected, how is it<br>governed, what are the administrative policies, how is it funded? How<br>do you make sure there is only one root (if that is a requirement)?<br><br>---<br><br>It seems that there is a missing piece of discussion about what happens<br>when an ITR operator advertises stuff it shouldn't (e.g., to attract<br>traffic). This is policeable, but the policing function is a critical<br>part of the deployment model. It needs to be described.<br><br>The nearest discussion I could find to this was in 5.3, but it doesn't<br>go close to talking about the problem.<br><br>Of course, a chunk of this could easily be argued to be an operational<br>discussion that belongs in a separate document.&nbsp; I'd be OK with that, on<br>the whole, but there are surely some deployment considerations as well.<br>Which model is best able to protect against this? What are the<br>deployment concerns related to this problem?</div></td>

Section 2.5.1<br><br>* The discussion of NAT traversal may benefit from some additional text that points at PCP as an alternative to static hole-punching.<br><br>9. Section 2.6<br><br>* It would be much clearer if there was some supporting text for the summary matrix.&nbsp; It is rather confusing to understand what the table is trying to tell the reader.<br><br>10. Section 3<br><br>* This section seems to be lacking the level of detail provided in Section 2.*.&nbsp; Are there any issues with deploying Map Servers/Resolvers behind NATs?&nbsp; In provider (vs. customer) networks?<br><br>11. Section 3.1<br><br>* It may be useful to provide a reference for ALT and DDT.<br><br>* There is an extraneous "SHOULD" in the second paragraph that needs to be moved to lower-case.<br><br>* The next-to-last paragraph mentions "known mapping system specific best practices".&nbsp; Are these documented anywhere?<br><br>12.

Section 5.1<br><br>* I would like to see some justification for the statement that the increase in LISP deployment will reduce the need for BGP-based TE.&nbsp; I can envision some scenarios where LISP could increase the BGP-based TE in order to access the "correct" ETR (or P-ETR).&nbsp; Is there some studies that back up this claim?<br><br>14. Section 5.3<br><br>* The second paragraph mentions "additional costs for the PSP".&nbsp; I would like to see some example costs highlighted.<br><br>15. Section 5.4<br><br>* The table discussing the potential benefits for DFZ route table size is interesting.&nbsp; But, that is only one metric and one that end-users probably don't care about.&nbsp; Is there some data on the overall routing/forwarding performance?&nbsp; For example, v4/v6 tunneling has been shown to increase RTT (due to inefficient paths).&nbsp; Will LISP have similar issues?&nbsp; What about the application-level performance due to decreased message size from encapsulation?<br><br>16. Section 6<br><br>* This whole section seems out of place compared to the rest of the document.&nbsp; There is no descriptive text introducing the section and reads more like a vendor's checklist.&nbsp; How does it relate to the rest of the document?<br><br>* Step 4 talks about verifying that local routers do not filter certain ICMP messages.&nbsp; What about filtering of those ICMP messages by upstream ISPs?<br><br>* Step 5 : s/provivers/providers/<br><br>17. Section 6.2<br><br>* Are the URLs in step 2 stable?&nbsp; It is generally bad form to include such URLs in an RFC since they may become stale/obsolete.<br><br><br>Feel free to discuss these issues with me as you resolve them.<br><br>Regards,<br>Brian<br></div></td>

This draft describes how to deploy its associated network elements, in order to identify possible deployment scenarios and the additional requirements they may impose on the protocol specification and other protocols. This document is intended as a guide for the operational community for LISP deployments in their networks and is expected to evolve as LISP deployment progresses, and the described scenarios are better understood or new scenarios are discovered. <br><br><br><br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough?<br><br>	There was no controversy nor any contentious issues during the WG process. The consensus was not rough and the draft came out as the result of a collective effort.<br><br><br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted?<br><br>	There are multiple implementations of the protocol that am aware of.

Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>	The document shepherd believes that there was a clear consensus for publishing the draft as informational RFC. LISP WG chairs asked for consensus during the LISP WG session then again on the ML. <br><br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director.
