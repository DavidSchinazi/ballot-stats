Given that this text is normative, please use a generic description (not specific to the example).<br><br>2. Section 3.2.1. (Outbound announcements (PE--&gt;CE)): "…no guidance in the BGPSec protocol specification [<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol/">I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol</a>] on whether or not the forward-signed ASN value MUST match the configured remote AS to validate properly…"&nbsp; That "MUST" is not normative in this document, nor it is being quoted.&nbsp; Please find a way to convey the same meaning w/out <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">rfc2119</a> language.&nbsp; Suggestion: s/MUST/must<br><br>3. There are some places where this document uses language around configuration or knobs, or even uses configuration snippets.&nbsp; Please avoid those and use the language from <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a>.&nbsp; Here are some examples, but there may be others that I missed:<br>* "configuration/transition/migration knobs" are mentioned several times.&nbsp; Please use "mechanisms" (or something like that) instead.<br>* 3.1: "replace-as as defined in <a href="/doc/rfc6480/">RFC 6480</a>"&nbsp; I believe the correct reference is to "Replace OLD AS" in <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a>.<br>* 3.2.1: "…if CE1's BGP session is configured as "remote-as 64510", the presence of "local-as 64510" on PE1…"<br>* 5: "…using the transition knobs detailed in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration</a>…"<br>* 5.1: "…locally configured with AS-migration knobs as discussed in <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration</a>…"<br>* 5.2: "…locally configured with AS-migration knobs …"<br>* 5.3: "…applying AS migration knobs…"<br><br>4. Section 4. (Requirements):<br>* "BGPSec MUST support AS Migration...&nbsp; It SHOULD do this without reducing BGPSec's protections for route path"&nbsp; Why is the "SHOULD" not a "MUST"?&nbsp; In other words, are there cases when it may be ok for reducing the protection?<br>* "SHOULD confine configuration changes to the migrating PEs e.g. can't require global configuration changes to support migration" This requirement is about configuration, not about the mechanism itself.&nbsp; Is there a way to express the same requirement in terms of functionality of the mechanism (and not configuration)?<br><br>5. Section 5.3. (Other considerations)&nbsp; There are a couple of places where normative language is used, but where it seems to me that what is described is "business as usual" and then shouldn't be mandated here.&nbsp; See below.&nbsp; Is my interpretation correct?<br>* "…routers that receive updates from iBGP neighbors MUST accept updates with new (properly-formed) BGPSec attributes…"&nbsp; Are you referring here to routers in general, as in routers that may not support the migration mechanism?&nbsp; Shouldn't these non-RFC7705 routers accept BGPSec attributes anyway?&nbsp; In other words, it is not something you need to mandate here because the updates are not really different from other BGPSec updates.&nbsp; Maybe the overall consideration is really that "BGPSec should be fully deployed" (or something like that) -- note that if other routers don't accept BGPSec attributes then BGPSec in general won't work and not just the migration mechanisms.<br>* "…any route-reflectors in the path of these updates MUST reflect them transparently to their clients."&nbsp; <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol/">draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol</a> doesn't explicitly talk about RRs, but it contains the text below in 4.1. (reference [18] is this document).&nbsp; The text basically says (paraphrasing) that a RR SHOULD NOT change the update…which is equivalent to if the<br>peer supports BGPSec then it MUST NOT change the update…which is the same as what you wrote (with the MUST, except for the caveat of the peer supporting BGPSec — which I think is implicit in your text).&nbsp; All this is to say that as with the case above the "MUST" is not needed.<br>* "The case where the BGPsec speaker sends a BGPsec update message to an internal (iBGP) peer is quite simple.&nbsp; …the BGPsec speaker typically populates the BGPsec_Path attribute by copying the BGPsec_Path attribute from the received update message.&nbsp; That is, the BGPsec_Path attribute is copied verbatim. However, in the case that the BGPsec speaker is performing an AS Migration, the BGPsec speaker may add an additional signature on ingress before copying the BGPsec_Path attribute (see [18] for more details).<br>Note that when a BGPsec speaker chooses to forward a BGPsec update message to an iBGP peer, the BGPsec attribute SHOULD NOT be removed, unless the peer doesn't support BGPsec."<br><br><br>6. Section 8. (Security Considerations)&nbsp; <br>* "BGPSec MUST be able to manage this legitimate use of AS_Path manipulation…" This sounds like a requirement for BGPSec, but skimming that document it looks like it doesn't do anything special as a result (just reference this document for more information).&nbsp; Having said that, this document uses BGPSec mechanisms to solve the problem — the procedure is changed, but I don't think that the characteristics of the solution is.&nbsp; I'm trying to argue eliminating the "MUST" because the solution is realized without BGPSec having to do anything extra.<br><br>7. As with <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a> updating <a href="/doc/rfc4271/">RFC4271</a>, should this document be marked as updating the BGPSec document?&nbsp; I think it does.<br><br><br>Minor<br><br>1. s/I-D.ietf-idr-as-migration/RFC7705<br>2. Section 2. (General Scenario).&nbsp; The scenario is not fully described in this section (which is ok), and I know there's a forward reference to 5.4.&nbsp; It might be good to mention that the rest of the document will rely heavily on the example and the figures in <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a> so that people read them before going on.<br>3. Section 3. (RPKI Considerations): As you know, I'm not thrilled about text like this: "While SPs SHOULD NOT remain in this transition phase indefinitely…" because I think it can't be enforced and it is an unnecessary use of <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">rfc2119</a> language.&nbsp; I am really happy that we avoided such language in <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a>.&nbsp; Maybe a compromise is to point this document to the Operational Considerations (Section 5) which basically discusses the same thing (and avoid having the same discussion is two places).<br>4. Please check the section references to BGPSec — the latest version (-15) doesn't seem to match the references in the document.<br>5. I think it would be worth pointing at <a href="/doc/rfc7705/">RFC7705</a> in the Security Considerations.<br><br><br>Nits:<br><br>1. s/The reason that this migration requires a slightly different solution in BGPSec than for a standard confederation is that unlike in a confederation, eBGP peers…/This migration requires a different solution in BGPSec because unlike in a confederation, eBGP peers…<br>2. s/(section 5.4) (Section 5.4)/(section 5.4)<br>3. 5.4: "…the "keep" AS"&nbsp; This is only used in this section.&nbsp; Maybe better to stick with old AS.</div></td>

Folk in the working group seem to agree, and the partner document in IDR (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/03/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration-03</a>) is moving forward at this time as well.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The document shepherd does not harbor any concerns about this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>I believe the parts of this document which require specialized review have been reviewed. That review was done by IDR folk during the working group work on that document as well.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I'm not concerned about this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>The wg consensus appears to be solid for this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>There are no threats at this time.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).

Noting that the numbers used in this document are private/reserved seems to be on point, and the references seem to be relevant to the flow and intent of the document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.

Folk in the working group seem to agree, and the partner document in IDR (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/03/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration-03</a>) is moving forward at this time as well.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The document shepherd does not harbor any concerns about this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>I believe the parts of this document which require specialized review have been reviewed. That review was done by IDR folk during the working group work on that document as well.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I'm not concerned about this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>The wg consensus appears to be solid for this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>There are no threats at this time.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>The idnits process turned up:<br>&nbsp; An old date (30 days ago).<br>&nbsp; 1 downref to <a href="/doc/rfc5398/">RFC5398</a> (which seems ok in this case)<br><br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>There are not normative references to unfinished documents.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5398/">RFC5398</a> is referenced in this document, because AS numbers are used in the document, numbers which are from the reserved AS number space. Noting that the numbers used in this document are private/reserved seems to be on point, and the references seem to be relevant to the flow and intent of the document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>I reviewed the IANA considerations section in this document, there are no considerations for IANA here.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A</div></td>

I believe there were not any show stopping parts to this conversation.<br><br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; This document describes methods and considerations that could be used in supporting and securing a common method of AS Migration used in networks today.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Chris Morrow<br>&nbsp; AD: Alia Atlas<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I read the document (a few times now) and believe the document is ready for publication. Folk in the working group seem to agree, and the partner document in IDR (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/03/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration-03</a>) is moving forward at this time as well.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The document shepherd does not harbor any concerns about this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>I believe the parts of this document which require specialized review have been reviewed. That review was done by IDR folk during the working group work on that document as well.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I'm not concerned about this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>The wg consensus appears to be solid for this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>There are no threats at this time.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

Noting that the numbers used in this document are private/reserved seems to be on point, and the references seem to be relevant to the flow and intent of the document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>I reviewed the IANA considerations section in this document, there are no considerations for IANA here.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations.

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary<br>&nbsp;  This draft discusses considerations and methods for supporting and<br>&nbsp;  securing a common method for AS-Migration within the BGPSec protocol.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br> There was considerable discussion about this document in both SIDR and IDR working groups. I believe there were not any show stopping parts to this conversation.<br><br>Document Quality<br>&nbsp; This is not a protocol, but configuration and implementation details being codified for <br>&nbsp; future implementers to be aware of, so operations of networks can continue. The <br>&nbsp; document outlines processes and procedures which are used today in networks,<br>&nbsp; most vendors implement a set of this document's features.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp; Document Shepherd: Chris Morrow<br>&nbsp; AD: Alia Atlas<br><br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>I read the document (a few times now) and believe the document is ready for publication. Folk in the working group seem to agree, and the partner document in IDR (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-idr-as-migration/03/">draft-ietf-idr-as-migration-03</a>) is moving forward at this time as well.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>The document shepherd does not harbor any concerns about this document.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>I believe the parts of this document which require specialized review have been reviewed. That review was done by IDR folk during the working group work on that document as well.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>I'm not concerned about this document.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>Yes<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?&nbsp;  <br><br>The wg consensus appears to be solid for this document.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>There are no threats at this time.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist).

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>There are not normative references to unfinished documents.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br><a href="/doc/rfc5398/">RFC5398</a> is referenced in this document, because AS numbers are used in the document, numbers which are from the reserved AS number space. Noting that the numbers used in this document are private/reserved seems to be on point, and the references seem to be relevant to the flow and intent of the document.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>I reviewed the IANA considerations section in this document, there are no considerations for IANA here.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>N/A<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>N/A</div></td>
