Please note that D below is new and a consequence in my trying to clarify C. why it matters. <br><br>A. The need for latency bounding the POF to enable the MPLS S-Label path to be bounded if reordering protection service is needed.<br><br>To my understanding in an MPLS network the controller can determine an upper bound of the latency for a path by adding together the path latencies, the packet buffer depths based on the forwarding behavior applied, and the POF buffer depth. However, as currently described it is not made clear that the POF needs to have a configuration for an upper bound of how long a packet may maximum remain in the buffer since arrival. This requirement is somewhat discussed in <br><br>So <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework/:">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework/:</a><br><br>3.5.2.2.&nbsp; Path Differential Delay<br><br>&nbsp;  In the preceding example, proper working of duplicate elimination and<br>&nbsp;  reordering of packets are dependent on the number of out-of-order<br>&nbsp;  packets that can be buffered and the delay difference of arriving<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; DetNet uses flow-specific requirements (e.g., maximum<br>&nbsp;  number of out-of-order packets, maximum latency of the flow) for<br>&nbsp;  configuration of POF-related buffers.&nbsp; If the differential delay<br>&nbsp;  between paths is excessively large or there is excessive mis-ordering<br>&nbsp;  of the packets, then packets may be dropped instead of being<br>&nbsp;  reordered.&nbsp; Likewise, PEF uses the sequence number to identify<br>&nbsp;  duplicate packets, and large differential delays combined with high<br>&nbsp;  numbers of packets may exceed the ability of the PEF to work<br>&nbsp;  properly.<br><br>So this configuration needs to be required on the MPLS POF implementation to enable the controller to bound the latency between ingress and egress when POF is used. And it needs to be done in time, per the below paragraph.<br><br>So given that the buffer is specified in either bytes or simply packets to be buffered will result in that the POF buffering time becomes packet flow dependent and not bounded in time. So if you make the calculation for a DETNET flow thinking it will send 500 packets per second evenly spaced. Then the a buffer of 5 packets would represent an upper limit 1/100th of second. If then the flow sends only 100 packet per second then suddendly the 5-packet buffering would represent 1/20th of a second. Thus defining it in packets or size doesn't work, the upper buffering time needs to be defined in time to provide a bounded latency. <br><br>I would note that soley configuring an upper bound between arrival in POF buffer until latest release is more fragile than actually having actual timestamp applied at egress to each packet. But, it can ensure bounded delay as long as the other functions do keep to their boundary. <br><br>However, I think the solution here is to clarify the configuration requirement on the POF in Section 4.2.2.3.<br><br>B. On the relation of the PEF to the POF. <br><br>The document does not discuss this, and maybe this is fairly obvious but a relation ship exists. The PEF state needs to be deeper than the POFs when both are used. Otherwise duplicates may be forwarded. If the PEF is at least as deep as the POF, then any duplicate that is more out of order than what the POF allows will be discarded. However, as the POF is not that explicitly specified, even if the information document do define that is what should be done. <br><br>I would recommend that the text is made more clear on this relationship and also are explicit about the discard of out of order in the POF. <br><br>C. On the implementation details of the PEF and POF in regards to how they accept packets. <br><br>So the PEF is likely implemented with a basic data structure which tracks the N latest received packets and keep state if these packets have been seen or not. However, an important implementation detail for this is how this handles when a packet received are significantly higher than previous seen. So does that result in that highest seen are advanced forward to this value? So the 16-bit and 28-bit sequence numbers define a circular space. I assume one tracks the highest sequence number received (H_SN). Based on that one usually consider packets in the range [(H_SN-2^15) MOD 2^16, HSN-1] as older packets not updating the H_SN (for 16-bit sequence numbers) and can consider packets in the range [H_SN+1, H_SN + 2^15-1] as newer. However as N (number of actually tracked packets) are only a sub-set of the fully sequence number the PEF will consider a packet that falls into the range of older packets but outside of the N packets where one have state as to old, and will discard as one lack information about if it is a duplicate or not. <br><br>As you may seen this implementation would cause packet loss in the event that packets for this S-Label has passed the ingress and the PRF have put in sequence number and duplicating them and then the packet have been lost due to failure in forwarding the traffic. Then when the network have recovered from this failure there are a significant risk that the packets are outside of the window of validity that would trigger the H_SN to be updated and instead cause all packets to be dropped. <br><br>Thus in case of failures there appear to exist a need to be able to reset this state and require the sequence number that is current. And if the details of how these filters are impelementation specific and do not use the ranges I specify the controller would have to potentially cause a reset of the functions for any disturbance as the impact is unknown. <br><br>Maybe this is a minor risk in this environment, but the need to reset the POF and PEF state appears necessary for recovery. <br><br>D. Denial of service risk with attacker modifying sequence number or performing packet injection between ingress and egrees.<br><br>Based on what is written in C I would also note that there exist a serious Denial of Service attack on the Detnet flow.<br><br>If the attacker is capable of either periodically modify the sequence number of an MPLS packet for a particular S-label or inject a MPLS packet into the system that will traverse to the S-Labels PEF or POF at egress with a crafted sequence number. In either of these cases the attacker can advance the acceptance window periodically so that the actual traffic falls into the range that is discarded by the PEF and POF. Thus, cheaply accomplishing a total denial of service.<br><br>I think this risk due to the PEF and POF should be made explicit in the security considerations. Mitigations needs to be in place to prevent packet modification or injection inside the MPLS network. Some of these appears to be already discussed.</div></td>

As the text discusses there can be a configured limit for how deep the buffer and state are for performing these operations. We all know that the implementation of this will have a practical limit in both buffer space for reordering as well as state for tracking which sequence numbers that have been forwarded. I think that should be more clearly expressed in the document that these practical limits exists. Thus, the implementations will have tracking and determination of what are new packets (increasing sequence number within a window higher than previous largest seen. And consider sequence number form currently highest seen and a bit backwards as older packets. Thus how this is implemented will impact how this acts in cases of disruptions of the packet flow. Thus, I wonder if there is actually need to be&nbsp; a bit more specific in how classification should be done. Especially if the wrap-around of the sequence number space approaches a small multiple of round trip times for the path which is likely for the 16-bit space. <br><br>Then&nbsp; sections fails to discuss how the duplication removal, the reordering buffering and bound latency interacts and affet each other.&nbsp; So if the latency is bounded then the reordering has an hard time limit for the maximum delay. If there is a boundary for reordering then there are no point in de-duplicating packets that will not be forwarded due to the reordering. And even if there are no bounded latency the reordering buffer size will still impact the depth of de-duplication. These practical limits will also be limitations on the guarantees that can be provided. <br><br>Thus, from my perspective there is need for more text on the requirements of the implementation of these functions and their interactions of creating limitations. <br><br>Another point on 4.2.2.2:<br><br>When configured, the<br>&nbsp;  implementation MUST track the sequence number contained in received<br>&nbsp;  d-CWs and MUST ensure that duplicate (replicated) instances of a<br>&nbsp;  particular sequence number are discarded.<br><br>That second MUST I think is possible to meet given that one discard all packets outside of the current window where one have information if a packet sequence number have been forwarded or not. Given that a very late packet beyond the amount of state for the flow likely anyway have little utility that is likely the right choice. However, I think it needs to be made explicit that this is okay. <br><br>In Section 4.2.2.3:<br><br> When configured, the<br>&nbsp;  implementation MUST track the sequence number contained in received<br>&nbsp;  d-CWs and MUST ensure that packets are processed in the order<br>&nbsp;  indicated in the received d-CW sequence number field, which may not<br>&nbsp;  be in the order the packets are received. <br><br>I think this part needs to be explicit that packets that are to fare out of order for the implementation to handle will/shall be dropped.<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that an implementation MAY wish to constrain the maximum number<br>&nbsp;  of out of order packets that can be processed, on platform-wide or<br>&nbsp;  per flow basis.&nbsp; Some implementations MAY support the provisioning of<br>&nbsp;  this number on either a platform-wide or per flow basis.&nbsp; The number<br>&nbsp;  of out of order packets that can be processed also impacts the<br>&nbsp;  latency of a flow.<br><br>If there exists a latency requirement then that will interact with this when it comes to reordering. In fact a significant issue here is that if the packet flow is not periodic at a steady pace the maximum latency in the reordering buffers based on packet sequence numbers can not be ensured. Instead some form of time limit needs to exist also. If that time limit is only local then there exists a risk that over multiple reordering buffers if multiple independent service labels are used the jitter and latency becomes cumulative. If the goal is to avoid this then the individual packets would need to carry a time stamp to ensure that from ingress of the service label path until the egress a maximum latency is added.</div></td>

Changes are expected over time. <br><br>This version is dated 1 November 2019.<br><br>(1)	What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? <br><br>Proposed Standard<br><br>(2)	Why is this the proper type of RFC? <br><br>This document normatively specifies the use of MPLS to provide DetNet data plane service.<br><br>(3)	Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Yes.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for MPLS routers that provide DetNet service to MPLS encapsulated data.&nbsp; MPLS encapsulation provides a solid foundation of building blocks to enable the DetNet functions, so no extensions to the core MPLS technology are required. Procedures and control information that is common to all DetNet data planes can be found in ietf-detnet-data-plane-framework.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>No controversy, pretty much just putting the pieces together. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Overall I am impressed with the clarity and conciseness of this draft. <br><br>Are there existing implementations of the protocol? <br><br>At this time there are no shipping implementations of DetNet per se, however clearly MPLS is a mature platform.<br><br>Have a significant number of vendors indicated their plan to implement the specification? <br><br>Several major vendors have been core to the development of DetNet, including Cisco, Huawei, and Ericsson so it is assumed that they plan to implement it.<br><br>Are there any reviewers that merit special mention as having done a thorough review, e.g., one that resulted in important changes or a conclusion that the document had no substantive issues? If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>The DetNet WG have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. In addition, a dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress this draft (and the associated set of data plane drafts). <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have read this document as it progressed as well as in its final form, and have found it to be particularly clear and well-written. What comments there were have been addressed. The document is ready for publication.<br><br><br>(4)	Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns. Numerous very experienced MPLS eyes have reviewed it. <br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No concerns. <br><br>(5)	Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br><br>No concerns. The progress of this draft has been quite linear, and it is ready to be published.<br><br>Regarding the number of authors of this draft, this draft is one of a group that represents a substantial part of the output of the WG for a number of years. We realize that the author count is intended to be 5 or less however we have carefully reviewed the author counts of these drafts at the time of WG LC to validate the contributions, and we sincerely believe that it would not be fair to remove any of the listed authors. <br><br>(6)	Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes, authors/contributors know of none, see<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/detnet/BI3lMBkzr2pebC__kb-eqVU-yEg</a><br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>There were no IPR concerns raised during WG acceptance of the document, nor during the period of its development.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>Very solid.&nbsp; The document (in the context of the full set of DetNet Data Plane drafts) is mature and has been discussed sufficiently among the broad DetNet WG audience.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>IDNits passes without errors.<br>There are idnits warnings regarding "outdated references" but this is because this is one of a set of drafts that refer to each other and will all be published together, so the RFC editor can fix this once all edits are final.&nbsp; <br>There is also a warning "Missing Reference: 'Network' is mentioned on line 174, but not defined" - however, what Idnits is finding is the text&nbsp; “[Network]” in the figure text (which is part of a diagram) and looking for a corresponding reference, which makes no sense, i.e. this is due to a shortcoming of idnits, not the draft. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>No, N/A.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>N/A, no IANA requests.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>None.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>The only automated review was idnits.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>YANG models related to DetNet are in a separate draft, so N/A here.&nbsp; <br><br></div></td>

If there was a MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, Media Type or other expert review, what was its course (briefly)? In the case of a Media Type review, on what date was the request posted? <br><br>The DetNet WG have made extensive reviews of the present drafts. In addition, a dedicated Data Plane Design team have met informally, regularly, to review and progress this draft (and the associated set of data plane drafts). <br>Preceding the WG decisions to use IP and MPLS for the DetNet Data Plane, an extensive review of candidate technologies was done by Jouni Korhonen and team (<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt/">draft-ietf-detnet-dp-alt</a>).<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Who is the Document Shepherd? <br>Ethan Grossman<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director? <br><br>Deborah Brungard<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd.
