For example, Section 4.5 mentions that<br>resumption "can be used without also enabling 0-RTT" as if 0-RTT should<br>be off by default, but much of the previous discussion involving 0-RTT<br>treats it as an expected and normal part of the protocl.&nbsp; (For what<br>little it's worth, my own personal preference leans towards how <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a><br>treats 0-RTT data, as an optional and potentially dangerous thing that<br>should be off by default and only enabled after careful consideration,<br>though in some ways it actually seems significantly safer in QUIC than<br>TLS.&nbsp; Regardless, I do not see any value in re-litigating the question<br>at this point; I'm just hoping that the document can be consistent about<br>it.)<br><br>I think we would benefit from some clarity about the client's response<br>to a Retry.&nbsp; Specifically, is the client expected to use the same<br>ClientHello from the first Initial, in the Initial generated in response<br>to the Retry?&nbsp; I did not see any notes about, e.g., transport parameter<br>values sent by the client changing in response to Retry, and since the<br>Connection IDs change it seems that we might fall under the Random (and<br>key share) reuse considerations for TLS.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>I think this document also specifies some generic bits about how QUIC<br>uses cryptography, that are not directly related to TLS integration.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  The 0-RTT handshake is only possible if the client and server have<br>&nbsp;  previously communicated.&nbsp; In the 1-RTT handshake, the client is<br><br>Pedantically, <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> does allow the exchange of 0-RTT data for<br>externally provisioned PSKs (non-resumption), provided that the<br>necessary parameters are provisioned along with the PSK.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>Figure 3 shows "TLS Alerts" as being carried over QUIC Transport, but<br>per §4.8 TLS alerts are translated into QUIC connection errors and are<br>not sent natively.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; The TLS component provides a series of updates to the QUIC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; component, including (a) new packet protection keys to install (b)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state changes such as handshake completion, the server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate, etc.<br><br>I think that if we're going to talk about passing the server certificate<br>between TLS and QUIC components, we should be very clear about where/how<br>certificate validation occurs.&nbsp; For example, it would be pretty<br>disasterous if TLS passed the certificate to QUIC expecting that QUIC<br>would do any validation of the peer identity, but QUIC assumed that TLS<br>would only provide a validated certificate.&nbsp; Perhaps in §4.1 when we<br>mention the potential for "additional functions [...] to configure TLS",<br>we might mention "including certificate validation", if appropriate?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC carries TLS handshake data in CRYPTO frames, each of which<br>&nbsp;  consists of a contiguous block of handshake data identified by an<br>&nbsp;  offset and length.&nbsp; Those frames are packaged into QUIC packets and<br>&nbsp;  encrypted under the current TLS encryption level.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the benefit of specifically calling this a<br>"TLS encryption level".&nbsp; While it's true that the keys are being<br>provided by TLS, the cryptographic mechanisms being used are applied by<br>QUIC.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's a 1:1 correspondence between the QUIC and<br>TLS encryption levels, so perhaps it is acceptable to not have a<br>qualifier at all (for just "under the current encryption level").<br><br>&nbsp;  One important difference between TLS records (used with TCP) and QUIC<br>&nbsp;  CRYPTO frames is that in QUIC multiple frames may appear in the same<br>&nbsp;  QUIC packet as long as they are associated with the same packet<br>&nbsp;  number space.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm a bit confused as to what analogy is being made here.&nbsp; It seems to<br>be equating TLS records and QUIC frames, but of course multiple DTLS<br>records can appear in a single UDP datagram, so the difference between<br>QUIC and DTLS does not seem quite so large as depicted here.&nbsp; Of course,<br>if the analogy is supposed to be between TLS handshake messages and QUIC<br>frames, or TLS records and QUIC packets, then things would be different,<br>but I'm not sure what this is intended to say.<br><br>Section 4.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the handshake is complete, TLS becomes passive.&nbsp; TLS can still<br>&nbsp;  receive data from its peer and respond in kind, but it will not need<br>&nbsp;  to send more data unless specifically requested - either by an<br>&nbsp;  application or QUIC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(pedantic note) In some sense this is a forward-looking statement *about<br>TLS*, which is not something the QUIC WG is chartered to work on.&nbsp; That<br>said, because of how TLS feature negotiation is done, any new kind of<br>data spontaneously emitted by TLS would need to be negotiated with an<br>extension in the handshake, but I don't think we are attempting to<br>specifically lock down the set of extensions in the TLS handshake for<br>QUIC connections, so in theory a change to the TLS implementation<br>defaults could result in QUIC connections that have TLS spontaneously<br>emit data.&nbsp; On the gripping hand, I don't really see much need for a<br>text change here.<br><br>Section 4.1.5<br><br>Why does the server call Get Handshake twice between receiving the<br>client Initial and the client's second Hansdhake flight?&nbsp; IIUC the<br>interface says that additional handshake data will only be supplied from<br>TLS in response to input handshake data (and thus, not in response to<br>TLS generating new keys, which is what the figure suggests to be a<br>proximal trigger for the second Get Handshake).&nbsp; We should probably be<br>careful that the interfaces we document are capable of describing the<br>case where TLS provides both new keys and handshake bytes, and the<br>handshake bytes are split across encryption levels (as is the case for<br>the server's first flight), which may be the motivation for the two Get<br>Handshake calls depicted here.<br><br>Similarly, it's my understanding that the client should still call Get<br>Handshake after receiving the Initial (but would receive only keys and<br>not output handshake data at that point).&nbsp; I'm not sure whether the<br>figure should indicate that (ineffectual) Get Handshake call.<br><br>Should the figure indicate the Handshake Confirmed operation in addition<br>to Handshake Complete?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello<br>&nbsp;  is sufficiently large.&nbsp; QUIC PADDING frames are added to increase the<br>&nbsp;  size of the packet as necessary.<br><br>Should we reference Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] for "sufficiently<br>large"?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  typically involves verification that the identity of the server is<br>&nbsp;  included in a certificate and that the certificate is issued by a<br>&nbsp;  trusted entity (see for example [<a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>]).<br><br>I assume that, per normal TLS semantics, this requirement can be met by<br>PSK authentication as well as certificate authentication.&nbsp; PSK<br>authentication has often been an aspect of TLS that has not received<br>substantial attention, so we may want to preemtively pay some attention<br>to the PSK case.<br><br>&nbsp;  A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as<br>&nbsp;  defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]), because the multiplexing<br><br>Do we want to say anything about not sending the "post_handshake_auth"<br>extension (defined in the numerologically similar section 4.2.6 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a>)?&nbsp; Strictly speaking we don't need to say anything, but efficient<br>implementations would satisfy the existing QUIC requirement by not<br>sending the extension and relying on the TLS stack to reject<br>post-handshake authentication since the extension had not been offered.<br><br>Section 4.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The alert level of all TLS alerts is "fatal"; a TLS stack MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  generate alerts at the "warning" level.<br><br>This seems to be making a normative restriction on the operation of TLS,<br>which is not in the QUIC WG charter.&nbsp; Perhaps we should instead<br>constrain the QUIC implementation to not accept such alerts (and what to<br>do if they are received) and note that the only closure alerts in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a> are "close_notify" and "user_cancelled", which are replaced by<br>equivalent QUIC-level functionality.<br><br>Section 4.9<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint cannot discard keys for a given encryption level unless<br>&nbsp;  it has both received and acknowledged all CRYPTO frames for that<br>&nbsp;  encryption level and when all CRYPTO frames for that encryption level<br>&nbsp;  have been acknowledged by its peer.&nbsp; However, this does not guarantee<br><br>(nit/editorial) I believe that the "both" is meant to apply to "received<br>and acknowledged" and "when all CRYTO frames [...] have been<br>acknowledged", but the current formulation does not have parallel<br>structure between those clauses, so it ends up reading more naturally as<br>saying that the "both" refers to "received" and "acknowledged".&nbsp; I don't<br>have a simple suggestion for fixing it, though (it might require a<br>significant restructuring to fix), so I'm leaving it here in my comments<br>rather than incorporating a fix into my editorial PR.&nbsp; (Any drastic<br>rewording might consider the rest of the paragraph as well, as it seems<br>to leave the reader without a clear sense for when it definitely is safe<br>to discard old keys.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Though an endpoint might retain older keys, new data MUST be sent at<br>&nbsp;  the highest currently-available encryption level.&nbsp; Only ACK frames<br>&nbsp;  and retransmissions of data in CRYPTO frames are sent at a previous<br>&nbsp;  encryption level.&nbsp; These packets MAY also include PADDING frames.<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about whether it is advisable to make<br>retransmission packets have the same size as the original transmission?<br>("No" is a fine answer.)<br><br>Section 4.9.3<br><br>&nbsp;  0-RTT keys to allow decrypting reordered packets without requiring<br>&nbsp;  their contents to be retransmitted with 1-RTT keys.&nbsp; After receiving<br>&nbsp;  a 1-RTT packet, servers MUST discard 0-RTT keys within a short time;<br>&nbsp;  the RECOMMENDED time period is three times the Probe Timeout (PTO,<br>&nbsp;  see [QUIC-RECOVERY]).&nbsp; A server MAY discard 0-RTT keys earlier if it<br><br>Just to check my understanding, the two endpoints will not necessarily<br>agree on the value of PTO at any given point in time, so this is a<br>heuristic and not some form of synchronized behavior where the server<br>replicates the client's loss-detection algorithm precisely?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Retry packets use AEAD_AES_128_GCM to provide protection against<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accidental modification or insertion by off-path adversaries; see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 5.8.<br><br>[As noted by others, please check the terminology here against<br>[QUIC-TRANSPORT]; I think the latter uses "attacker" rather than<br>"adversary" and I haven't internalized the new on-path, limited on-path,<br>off-path terminology yet, either.]<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; All other packets have strong cryptographic protections for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; confidentiality and integrity, using keys and algorithms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negotiated by TLS.<br><br>(side note) the handshake keys are "strong" in a certain sense<br>(unpredictability) but weak in the sense that they are not authenticated<br>until the handshake has completed.&nbsp; It may not be necessary to attempt<br>to express this subtlety in this point in the document, though.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>I think we should say something about the "Context" argument to<br>HKDF-Expand-Label here.&nbsp; (I assume it is going to be the same<br>Transcript-Hash as used for TLS 1.3, but it is not currently specified,<br>as far as I can see.&nbsp; I do note that we have some ongoing discussion in<br>the context of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/">draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13</a> that *exporters*, at least,<br>might better have been specified to use the full transcript including<br>client Finished, but I am not convinced that we should consider such<br>drastic changes for our usage, especially since it would neuter 0.5-RTT<br>unless we add a lot more complexity.)&nbsp; We may also want to say that<br>the Length input is determined by the ciphersuite's requirements.<br>Alternately we could specify in terms of Derive-Secret(), but there's<br>not really a clear incentive to do so.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This secret is determined by using HKDF-Extract (see Section 2.2 of<br>&nbsp;  [HKDF]) with a salt of 0x38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a and<br>&nbsp;  a IKM of the Destination Connection ID field.&nbsp; This produces an<br>&nbsp;  intermediate pseudorandom key (PRK) that is used to derive two<br>&nbsp;  separate secrets for sending and receiving.<br><br>[I was going to say something about all-zeros providing the same level<br>of cryptographic protection, but then I saw the discussion at<br><a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325</a> and the note further<br>down that new versions of QUIC should pick different salt values.]<br>I assume this holds for the final RFC version as compared to the I-Ds,<br>and <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711</a> suggests that a new<br>(random) salt should be chosen for the final RFC version, but I didn't<br>see an open issue in github for it, so I'll mention it here just in case<br>that helps.&nbsp;

(The idea would be to hew to the TLS 1.3<br>terminology where specific named Secrets are used to drive<br>Derive-Secret() calls but other cryptographic inputs are not named with<br>the word "secret".)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC can use any of the cipher suites defined in [TLS13] with the<br>&nbsp;  exception of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's a little interesting to use the RFC as the authority on<br>ciphersuites rather than the registry, but I guess the header protection<br>scheme requirement makes it more reasonable.&nbsp; Also, for what it's worth,<br>there are MAC-only TLS 1.3 ciphersuites in the IANA registry.&nbsp; I don't<br>know whether you want to say anything (to forbid?) such things from<br>being used as QUIC AEADs.<br><br>Section 5.4.x<br><br>Are we really sure that we want to use normative pseudocode?&nbsp; I thought<br>(but cannot currently substantiate) that we typically preferred<br>normative prose and example pseudocode, since pseudocode somewhat<br>intrinsically has not-fully-specified semantics.&nbsp; As some specific (but<br>not comprehensive!) examples, which bytes of the mask are used when the<br>packet number is encoded in fewer than 4 bytes, and the key/plaintext<br>inputs to AES-ECB seem to only be specified in the pseudocode.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Once an endpoint successfully receives a packet with a given packet<br>&nbsp;  number, it MUST discard all packets in the same packet number space<br>&nbsp;  with higher packet numbers if they cannot be successfully unprotected<br>&nbsp;  with either the same key, or - if there is a key update - the next<br>&nbsp;  packet protection key (see Section 6).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Pedantically, "the next packet protection key" seems to imply<br>specifically the one next key, not "any subsequent key".&nbsp; A strict<br>reading of this text would thust require discarding all packets received<br>after a second key update, because this clause applies to the very first<br>packet successfully received, and the third key used is neither the<br>"same" or "next" key, from that reference point.&nbsp; (I note that in §6.4<br>we merely talk about "either the same or newer packet protection keys".)<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Of the frames defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the STREAM, RESET_STREAM,<br>&nbsp;  and CONNECTION_CLOSE frames are potentially unsafe for use with 0-RTT<br>&nbsp;  as they carry application data.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I guess STOP_SENDING is not listed as unsafe because it would be an<br>error to send it in 0-RTT anyway?<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  The requirement for the server to wait for the client Finished<br>&nbsp;  message creates a dependency on that message being delivered.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  client can avoid the potential for head-of-line blocking that this<br>&nbsp;  implies by sending its 1-RTT packets coalesced with a Handshake<br>&nbsp;  packet containing a copy of the CRYPTO frame that carries the<br>&nbsp;  Finished message, until one of the Handshake packets is acknowledged.<br>&nbsp;  This enables immediate server processing for those packets.<br><br>This mostly only helps for unauthenticated clients, since for<br>authenticated clients the Finishsed isn't much good without the<br>Certificate+CertificateVerify, which are probably too big to include<br>with every packet.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The secret key and the nonce are values derived by calling HKDF-<br>&nbsp;  Expand-Label using<br>&nbsp;  0xd9c9943e6101fd200021506bcc02814c73030f25c79d71ce876eca876e6fca8e as<br>&nbsp;  the secret, with labels being "quic key" and "quic iv" (Section 5.1).<br><br>HKDF-Expand-Label also takes a "Context" argument; what value is used<br>for that?&nbsp; (Presumably the ouput Length argument is set to the lengths<br>of the stated fields.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Retry Pseudo-Packet {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ODCID Length (8),<br>&nbsp;

 Retry Token (..),<br>&nbsp;  }<br><br>Should we say that the four bits before Version are Unused (not<br>Type-Specific Bits), as they are in the Retry packet itself?&nbsp; (I assume<br>that the the arbitrary value in those bits does need to be preserved,<br>though.)<br><br>Section 6<br><br>I suggest noting that, in contrast to TLS, key updates are synchronized<br>between traffic directions; read keys are updated at the same time that<br>write keys are (and vice versa).<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The process of creating new packet protection keys for receiving<br>&nbsp;  packets could reveal that a key update has occurred.&nbsp; An endpoint MAY<br>&nbsp;  perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a<br>&nbsp;  timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key<br>&nbsp;  updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints MAY instead defer the creation of the next set of<br>&nbsp;  receive packet protection keys until some time after a key update<br>&nbsp;  completes, up to three times the PTO; see Section 6.5.<br><br>(editorial) I think this paragraph (and following) might need a rewrite,<br>since the phrase "new keys" in the context of a key update could be<br>ambiguous.&nbsp; In particular, if we are considering the process of a key<br>update from generation M to generation N, this text only seems to make<br>sense if the "new keys" whose generation is being discussed is<br>generation O (i.e., ones that are not being used to send traffic yet by<br>anybody), but it is easy to misread "new keys" as being "the ones<br>installed/activated for use as part of the key update process".&nbsp; Perhaps<br>the guidance that endpoints are to maintain both current and next keys<br>in normal operation should be moved earlier, with the context that you<br>need to be prepared to handle any valid incoming packets (which includes<br>those using both current and next keys, since the peer can initiate a<br>key update) without a timing channel for when key generation is<br>occurring.&nbsp; (There may be some similar text in §9.5 that would be<br>updated in accordance with any changes made here.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  retained, even if the packet that was received was subsequently<br>&nbsp;  discarded.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>What is "the packet" that was received?<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout<br>&nbsp;  (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after receiving a packet that uses the new<br>&nbsp;  key generation before it creates the next set of packet protection<br>&nbsp;  keys.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(editorial) Similarly to the previous section, I think the action being<br>described here might be more properly described as "promoting the 'next'<br>keys to be the 'current' keys (and thus starting the precomputation for<br>the subsequent 'next' keys)".&nbsp; Surly this is not advocating waiting a<br>PTO before generating the keys you need to process a packet you just<br>received ... right?<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The usage limits defined in TLS 1.3 exist for protection against<br>&nbsp;  attacks on confidentiality and apply to successful applications of<br>&nbsp;  AEAD protection.&nbsp; The integrity protections in authenticated<br>&nbsp;  encryption also depend on limiting the number of attempts to forge<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; TLS achieves this by closing connections after any record<br>&nbsp;  fails an authentication check.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC ignores any<br>&nbsp;  packet that cannot be authenticated, allowing multiple forgery<br>&nbsp;  attempts.<br><br>QUIC seems very analogous to DTLS in this regard, and DTLS 1.3 also has<br>similar text about AEAD limits for integrity.&nbsp; Perhaps a brief mention<br>that they are essentially the same is useful?<br><br>&nbsp;  For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit<br>&nbsp;  is 2^23 encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, the confidentiality limit is greater than the<br>&nbsp;  number of possible packets (2^62) and so can be disregarded.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^21.5 encrypted<br>&nbsp;  packets; see Appendix B.2.&nbsp; Applying a limit reduces the probability<br>&nbsp;  that an attacker can distinguish the AEAD in use from a random<br>&nbsp;  permutation; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST], and [GCM-MU].<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; These limits were originally calculated using assumptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about the limits on TLS record size.&nbsp; The maximum size of a TLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; record is 2^14 bytes.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC packets can be up to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2^16 bytes.&nbsp; However, it is expected that QUIC packets will<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generally be smaller than TLS records.&nbsp; Where packets might be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; larger than 2^14 bytes in length, smaller limits might be needed.<br><br>(This seems to say that we're just reusing the TLS numbers even though<br>in theory we do allow larger packets.&nbsp; But if that's the case, why do<br>the actual numbers we present differ from the ones given for DTLS 1.3?<br>The actual text in Appendix B suggests that we are not actually reusing<br>the TLS numbers (since we use different estimates for l, and<br>furthermore, that [GCM-MU] allows larger limits than [AEBounds] as used<br>by TLS 1.3).)<br><br>&nbsp;  Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define<br>&nbsp;  limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves<br>&nbsp;  margins for confidentiality and integrity.&nbsp; That is, limits MUST be<br>&nbsp;  specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for<br>&nbsp;  the number of packets that can fail authentication.&nbsp; Providing a<br>&nbsp;  reference to any analysis upon which values are based - and any<br>&nbsp;  assumptions used in that analysis - allows limits to be adapted to<br>&nbsp;  varying usage conditions.<br><br>DTLS 1.3 imposes essentially the same requirement.&nbsp; IIUC it would be<br>acceptable to use the same limit for DTLS 1.3 and for QUIC, and we<br>should perhaps say that if a cipher is allowed for one it is allowed for<br>the other (with the same limit), though on second though, we really do<br>want the analysis to take into account the different assumptions about<br>the number of blocks in a packet..<br><br>Section 9<br><br>In various places (e.g., §4.1.4) we recommend to buffer (or "retain")<br>data that cannot be processed yet.&nbsp; Perhaps it goes without saying, but<br>such buffering needs limits in place in order to avoid DoS.<br><br>It may be too banal to mention again here that the Initial secret/keys<br>are not particularly secure, but I'll mention it just in case we want<br>to.<br><br>Section 9.6<br><br>&nbsp;

I plan to<br>change my position to Yes once the Discuss points have been<br>appropriately discussed.&nbsp; My apologies in advance to the chairs who will<br>have to open github issues for all<br>of these!<br><br>We may want to make a pass through the document to normalize the way in<br>which we discuss 0-RTT.&nbsp; For example, Section 4.5 mentions that<br>resumption "can be used without also enabling 0-RTT" as if 0-RTT should<br>be off by default, but much of the previous discussion involving 0-RTT<br>treats it as an expected and normal part of the protocl.&nbsp; (For what<br>little it's worth, my own personal preference leans towards how <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a><br>treats 0-RTT data, as an optional and potentially dangerous thing that<br>should be off by default and only enabled after careful consideration,<br>though in some ways it actually seems significantly safer in QUIC than<br>TLS.&nbsp; Regardless, I do not see any value in re-litigating the question<br>at this point; I'm just hoping that the document can be consistent about<br>it.)<br><br>I think we would benefit from some clarity about the client's response<br>to a Retry.&nbsp; Specifically, is the client expected to use the same<br>ClientHello from the first Initial, in the Initial generated in response<br>to the Retry?&nbsp; I did not see any notes about, e.g., transport parameter<br>values sent by the client changing in response to Retry, and since the<br>Connection IDs change it seems that we might fall under the nonce (and<br>key share) reuse considerations for TLS.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>I think this document also specifies some generic bits about how QUIC<br>uses cryptography, that are not directly related to TLS integration.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 *&nbsp; The TLS component provides a series of updates to the QUIC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; component, including (a) new packet protection keys to install (b)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state changes such as handshake completion, the server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate, etc.<br><br>I think that if we're going to talk about passing the server certificate<br>between TLS and QUIC components, we should be very clear about where/how<br>certificate validation occurs.&nbsp; For example, it would be pretty<br>disasterous if TLS passed the certificate to QUIC expecting that QUIC<br>would do any validation of the peer identity, but QUIC assumed that TLS<br>would only provide a validated certificate.&nbsp; Perhaps in §4.1 when we<br>mention the potential for "additional functions [...] to configure TLS",<br>we might mention "including certificate validation", if appropriate?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC carries TLS handshake data in CRYPTO frames, each of which<br>&nbsp;  consists of a contiguous block of handshake data identified by an<br>&nbsp;  offset and length.&nbsp; Those frames are packaged into QUIC packets and<br>&nbsp;  encrypted under the current TLS encryption level.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the benefit of specifically calling this a<br>"TLS encryption level".&nbsp; While it's true that the keys are being<br>provided by TLS, the cryptographic mechanisms being used are applied by<br>QUIC.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's a 1:1 correspondence between the QUIC and<br>TLS encryption levels, so perhaps it is acceptable to not have a<br>qualifier at all (for just "under the current encryption level").<br><br>&nbsp;  One important difference between TLS records (used with TCP) and QUIC<br>&nbsp;  CRYPTO frames is that in QUIC multiple frames may appear in the same<br>&nbsp;  QUIC packet as long as they are associated with the same packet<br>&nbsp;  number space.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm a bit confused as to what analogy is being made here.&nbsp; It seems to<br>be equating TLS records and QUIC frames, but of course multiple DTLS<br>records can appear in a single UDP datagram, so the difference between<br>QUIC and DTLS does not seem quite so large as depicted here.&nbsp; Of course,<br>if the analogy is supposed to be between TLS handshake messages and QUIC<br>frames, or TLS records and QUIC packets, then things would be different,<br>but I'm not sure what this is intended to say.<br><br>Section 4.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the handshake is complete, TLS becomes passive.&nbsp; TLS can still<br>&nbsp;  receive data from its peer and respond in kind, but it will not need<br>&nbsp;  to send more data unless specifically requested - either by an<br>&nbsp;  application or QUIC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(pedantic note) In some sense this is a forward-looking statement *about<br>TLS*, which is not something the QUIC WG is chartered to work on.&nbsp; That<br>said, because of how TLS feature negotiation is done, any new kind of<br>data spontaneously emitted by TLS would need to be negotiated with an<br>extension in the handshake, but I don't think we are attempting to<br>specifically lock down the set of extensions in the TLS handshake for<br>QUIC connections, so in theory a change to the TLS implementation<br>defaults could result in QUIC connections that have TLS spontaneously<br>emit data.&nbsp; On the gripping hand, I don't really see much need for a<br>text change here.<br><br>Section 4.1.5<br><br>Why does the server call Get Handshake twice between receiving the<br>client Initial and the client's second Hansdhake flight?&nbsp; IIUC the<br>interface says that additional handshake data will only be supplied from<br>TLS in response to input handshake data (and thus, not in response to<br>TLS generating new keys, which is what the figure suggests to be a<br>proximal trigger for the second Get Handshake).&nbsp; We should probably be<br>careful that the interfaces we document are capable of describing the<br>case where TLS provides both new keys and handshake bytes, and the<br>handshake bytes are split across encryption levels (as is the case for<br>the server's first flight), which may be the motivation for the two Get<br>Handshake calls depicted here.<br><br>Similarly, it's my understanding that the client should still call Get<br>Handshake after receiving the Initial (but would receive only keys and<br>not output handshake data at that point).&nbsp; I'm not sure whether the<br>figure should indicate that (ineffectual) Get Handshake call.<br><br>Should the figure indicate the Handshake Confirmed operation in addition<br>to Handshake Complete?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello<br>&nbsp;  is sufficiently large.&nbsp; QUIC PADDING frames are added to increase the<br>&nbsp;  size of the packet as necessary.<br><br>Should we reference Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] for "sufficiently<br>large"?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  typically involves verification that the identity of the server is<br>&nbsp;  included in a certificate and that the certificate is issued by a<br>&nbsp;  trusted entity (see for example [<a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>]).<br><br>I assume that, per normal TLS semantics, this requirement can be met by<br>PSK authentication as well as certificate authentication.&nbsp; PSK<br>authentication has often been an aspect of TLS that has not received<br>substantial attention, so we may want to preemtively pay some attention<br>to the PSK case.<br><br>&nbsp;  A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as<br>&nbsp;  defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]), because the multiplexing<br><br>Do we want to say anything about not sending the "post_handshake_auth"<br>extension (defined in the numerologically similar section 4.2.6 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a>)?&nbsp; Strictly speaking we don't need to say anything, but efficient<br>implementations would satisfy the existing QUIC requirement by not<br>sending the extension and relying on the TLS stack to reject<br>post-handshake authentication since the extension had not been offered.<br><br>Section 4.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The alert level of all TLS alerts is "fatal"; a TLS stack MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  generate alerts at the "warning" level.<br><br>This seems to be making a normative restriction on the operation of TLS,<br>which is not in the QUIC WG charter.&nbsp; Perhaps we should instead<br>constrain the QUIC implementation to not accept such alerts (and what to<br>do if they are received) and note that the only closure alerts in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a> are "close_notify" and "user_cancelled", which are replaced by<br>equivalent QUIC-level functionality.<br><br>Section 4.9<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint cannot discard keys for a given encryption level unless<br>&nbsp;  it has both received and acknowledged all CRYPTO frames for that<br>&nbsp;  encryption level and when all CRYPTO frames for that encryption level<br>&nbsp;  have been acknowledged by its peer.&nbsp; However, this does not guarantee<br><br>(nit/editorial) I believe that the "both" is meant to apply to "received<br>and acknowledged" and "when all CRYTO frames [...] have been<br>acknowledged", but the current formulation does not have parallel<br>structure between those clauses, so it ends up reading more naturally as<br>saying that the "both" refers to "received" and "acknowledged".&nbsp; I don't<br>have a simple suggestion for fixing it, though (it might require a<br>significant restructuring to fix), so I'm leaving it here in my comments<br>rather than incorporating a fix into my editorial PR.&nbsp; (Any drastic<br>rewording might consider the rest of the paragraph as well, as it seems<br>to leave the reader without a clear sense for when it definitely is safe<br>to discard old keys.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Though an endpoint might retain older keys, new data MUST be sent at<br>&nbsp;  the highest currently-available encryption level.&nbsp; Only ACK frames<br>&nbsp;  and retransmissions of data in CRYPTO frames are sent at a previous<br>&nbsp;  encryption level.&nbsp; These packets MAY also include PADDING frames.<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about whether it is advisable to make<br>retransmission packets have the same size as the original transmission?<br>("No" is a fine answer.)<br><br>Section 4.9.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 the RECOMMENDED time period is three times the Probe Timeout (PTO,<br>&nbsp;  see [QUIC-RECOVERY]).&nbsp; A server MAY discard 0-RTT keys earlier if it<br><br>Just to check my understanding, the two endpoints will not necessarily<br>agree on the value of PTO at any given point in time, so this is a<br>heuristic and not some form of synchronized behavior where the server<br>replicates the client's loss-detection algorithm precisely?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Retry packets use AEAD_AES_128_GCM to provide protection against<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accidental modification or insertion by off-path adversaries; see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 5.8.<br><br>[As noted by others, please check the terminology here against<br>[QUIC-TRANSPORT]; I think the latter uses "attacker" rather than<br>"adversary" and I haven't internalized the new on-path, limited on-path,<br>off-path terminology yet, either.]<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; All other packets have strong cryptographic protections for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; confidentiality and integrity, using keys and algorithms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negotiated by TLS.<br><br>(side note) the handshake keys are "strong" in a certain sense<br>(unpredictability) but weak in the sense that they are not authenticated<br>until the handshake has completed.&nbsp; It may not be necessary to attempt<br>to express this subtlety in this point in the document, though.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>I think we should say something about the "Context" argument to<br>HKDF-Expand-Label here.&nbsp; (I assume it is going to be the same<br>Transcript-Hash as used for TLS 1.3, but it is not currently specified,<br>as far as I can see.&nbsp; I do note that we have some ongoing discussion in<br>the context of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/">draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13</a> that *exporters*, at least,<br>might better have been specified to use the full transcript including<br>client Finished, but I am not convinced that we should consider such<br>drastic changes for our usage, especially since it would neuter 0.5-RTT<br>unless we add a lot more complexity.)&nbsp; We may also want to say that<br>the Length input is determined by the ciphersuite's requirements.<br>Alternately we could specify in terms of Derive-Secret(), but there's<br>not really a clear incentive to do so.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This secret is determined by using HKDF-Extract (see Section 2.2 of<br>&nbsp;  [HKDF]) with a salt of 0x38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a and<br>&nbsp;  a IKM of the Destination Connection ID field.&nbsp; This produces an<br>&nbsp;  intermediate pseudorandom key (PRK) that is used to derive two<br>&nbsp;  separate secrets for sending and receiving.<br><br>[I was going to say something about all-zeros providing the same level<br>of cryptographic protection, but then I saw the discussion at<br><a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325</a> and the note further<br>down that new versions of QUIC should pick different salt values.]<br>I assume this holds for the final RFC version as compared to the I-Ds,<br>and <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711</a> suggests that a new<br>(random) salt should be chosen for the final RFC version, but I didn't<br>see an open issue in github for it, so I'll mention it here just in case<br>that helps.&nbsp;

(The idea would be to hew to the TLS 1.3<br>terminology where specific named Secrets are used to drive<br>Derive-Secret() calls but other cryptographic inputs are not named with<br>the word "secret".)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC can use any of the cipher suites defined in [TLS13] with the<br>&nbsp;  exception of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's a little interesting to use the RFC as the authority on<br>ciphersuites rather than the registry, but I guess the header protection<br>scheme requirement makes it more reasonable.&nbsp; Also, for what it's worth,<br>there are MAC-only TLS 1.3 ciphersuites in the IANA registry.&nbsp; I don't<br>know whether you want to say anything (to forbid?) such things from<br>being used as QUIC AEADs.<br><br>Section 5.4.x<br><br>Are we really sure that we want to use normative pseudocode?&nbsp; I thought<br>(but cannot currently substantiate) that we typically preferred<br>normative prose and example pseudocode, since pseudocode somewhat<br>intrinsically has not-fully-specified semantics.&nbsp; As some specific (but<br>not comprehensive!) examples, which bytes of the mask are used when the<br>packet number is encoded in fewer than 4 bytes, and the key/plaintext<br>inputs to AES-ECB seem to only be specified in the pseudocode.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Once an endpoint successfully receives a packet with a given packet<br>&nbsp;  number, it MUST discard all packets in the same packet number space<br>&nbsp;  with higher packet numbers if they cannot be successfully unprotected<br>&nbsp;  with either the same key, or - if there is a key update - the next<br>&nbsp;  packet protection key (see Section 6).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Pedantically, "the next packet protection key" seems to imply<br>specifically the one next key, not "any subsequent key".&nbsp; A strict<br>reading of this text would thust require discarding all packets received<br>after a second key update, because this clause applies to the very first<br>packet successfully received, and the third key used is neither the<br>"same" or "next" key, from that reference point.&nbsp; (I note that in §6.4<br>we merely talk about "either the same or newer packet protection keys".)<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Of the frames defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the STREAM, RESET_STREAM,<br>&nbsp;  and CONNECTION_CLOSE frames are potentially unsafe for use with 0-RTT<br>&nbsp;  as they carry application data.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I guess STOP_SENDING is not listed as unsafe because it would be an<br>error to send it in 0-RTT anyway?<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  The requirement for the server to wait for the client Finished<br>&nbsp;  message creates a dependency on that message being delivered.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  client can avoid the potential for head-of-line blocking that this<br>&nbsp;  implies by sending its 1-RTT packets coalesced with a Handshake<br>&nbsp;  packet containing a copy of the CRYPTO frame that carries the<br>&nbsp;  Finished message, until one of the Handshake packets is acknowledged.<br>&nbsp;  This enables immediate server processing for those packets.<br><br>This mostly only helps for unauthenticated clients, since for<br>authenticated clients the Finishsed isn't much good without the<br>Certificate+CertificateVerify, which are probably too big to include<br>with every packet.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The secret key and the nonce are values derived by calling HKDF-<br>&nbsp;  Expand-Label using<br>&nbsp;  0xd9c9943e6101fd200021506bcc02814c73030f25c79d71ce876eca876e6fca8e as<br>&nbsp;  the secret, with labels being "quic key" and "quic iv" (Section 5.1).<br><br>HKDF-Expand-Label also takes a "Context" argument;

read keys are updated at the same time that<br>write keys are (and vice versa).<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The process of creating new packet protection keys for receiving<br>&nbsp;  packets could reveal that a key update has occurred.&nbsp; An endpoint MAY<br>&nbsp;  perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a<br>&nbsp;  timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key<br>&nbsp;  updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints MAY instead defer the creation of the next set of<br>&nbsp;  receive packet protection keys until some time after a key update<br>&nbsp;  completes, up to three times the PTO; see Section 6.5.<br><br>(editorial) I think this paragraph (and following) might need a rewrite,<br>since the phrase "new keys" in the context of a key update could be<br>ambiguous.&nbsp; In particular, if we are considering the process of a key<br>update from generation M to generation N, this text only seems to make<br>sense if the "new keys" whose generation is being discussed is<br>generation O (i.e., ones that are not being used to send traffic yet by<br>anybody), but it is easy to misread "new keys" as being "the ones<br>installed/activated for use as part of the key update process".&nbsp; Perhaps<br>the guidance that endpoints are to maintain both current and next keys<br>in normal operation should be moved earlier, with the context that you<br>need to be prepared to handle any valid incoming packets (which includes<br>those using both current and next keys, since the peer can initiate a<br>key update) without a timing channel for when key generation is<br>occurring.&nbsp; (There may be some similar text in §9.5 that would be<br>updated in accordance with any changes made here.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  retained, even if the packet that was received was subsequently<br>&nbsp;  discarded.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>What is "the packet" that was received?<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout<br>&nbsp;  (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after receiving a packet that uses the new<br>&nbsp;  key generation before it creates the next set of packet protection<br>&nbsp;  keys.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(editorial) Similarly to the previous section, I think the action being<br>described here might be more properly described as "promoting the 'next'<br>keys to be the 'current' keys (and thus starting the precomputation for<br>the subsequent 'next' keys)".&nbsp; Surly this is not advocating waiting a<br>PTO before generating the keys you need to process a packet you just<br>received ... right?<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The usage limits defined in TLS 1.3 exist for protection against<br>&nbsp;  attacks on confidentiality and apply to successful applications of<br>&nbsp;  AEAD protection.&nbsp; The integrity protections in authenticated<br>&nbsp;  encryption also depend on limiting the number of attempts to forge<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; TLS achieves this by closing connections after any record<br>&nbsp;  fails an authentication check.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC ignores any<br>&nbsp;  packet that cannot be authenticated, allowing multiple forgery<br>&nbsp;  attempts.<br><br>QUIC seems very analogous to DTLS in this regard, and DTLS 1.3 also has<br>similar text about AEAD limits for integrity.&nbsp; Perhaps a brief mention<br>that they are essentially the same is useful?<br><br>&nbsp;  For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit<br>&nbsp;  is 2^23 encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, the confidentiality limit is greater than the<br>&nbsp;  number of possible packets (2^62) and so can be disregarded.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^21.5 encrypted<br>&nbsp;  packets; see Appendix B.2.&nbsp; Applying a limit reduces the probability<br>&nbsp;  that an attacker can distinguish the AEAD in use from a random<br>&nbsp;  permutation; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST], and [GCM-MU].<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; These limits were originally calculated using assumptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about the limits on TLS record size.&nbsp; The maximum size of a TLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; record is 2^14 bytes.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC packets can be up to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2^16 bytes.&nbsp; However, it is expected that QUIC packets will<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generally be smaller than TLS records.&nbsp; Where packets might be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; larger than 2^14 bytes in length, smaller limits might be needed.<br><br>(This seems to say that we're just reusing the TLS numbers even though<br>in theory we do allow larger packets.&nbsp; But if that's the case, why do<br>the actual numbers we present differ from the ones given for DTLS 1.3?<br>The actual text in Appendix B suggests that we are not actually reusing<br>the TLS numbers (since we use different estimates for l, and<br>furthermore, that [GCM-MU] allows larger limits than [AEBounds] as used<br>by TLS 1.3).)<br><br>&nbsp;  Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define<br>&nbsp;  limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves<br>&nbsp;  margins for confidentiality and integrity.&nbsp; That is, limits MUST be<br>&nbsp;  specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for<br>&nbsp;  the number of packets that can fail authentication.&nbsp; Providing a<br>&nbsp;  reference to any analysis upon which values are based - and any<br>&nbsp;  assumptions used in that analysis - allows limits to be adapted to<br>&nbsp;  varying usage conditions.<br><br>DTLS 1.3 imposes essentially the same requirement.&nbsp; IIUC it would be<br>acceptable to use the same limit for DTLS 1.3 and for QUIC, and we<br>should perhaps say that if a cipher is allowed for one it is allowed for<br>the other (with the same limit), though on second though, we really do<br>want the analysis to take into account the different assumptions about<br>the number of blocks in a packet..<br><br>Section 9<br><br>In various places (e.g., §4.1.4) we recommend to buffer (or "retain")<br>data that cannot be processed yet.&nbsp; Perhaps it goes without saying, but<br>such buffering needs limits in place in order to avoid DoS.<br><br>It may be too banal to mention again here that the Initial secret/keys<br>are not particularly secure, but I'll mention it just in case we want<br>to.<br><br>Section 9.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The initial secrets use a key that is specific to the negotiated QUIC<br>&nbsp;  version.&nbsp; New QUIC versions SHOULD define a new salt value used in<br>&nbsp;  calculating initial secrets.<br><br>Also for the Retry Integrity Tag key/nonce secret?<br><br>Appendix A.1, A.5<br><br>I think that <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> has us write just "" instead of _ to indicate a<br>zero-length Context.&nbsp;

 By setting "q = v", values for both confidentiality and integrity<br>&nbsp;  limits can be produced.&nbsp; Endpoints that limit packets to 2^11 bytes<br>&nbsp;  therefore have both confidentiality and integrity limits of 2^26.5<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints that do not restrict packet size have a limit of<br>&nbsp;  2^21.5.<br><br>DTLS currently has text that does a dedicated computation for "q" and<br>then substitutes that established value into this last formula to<br>determine the limit for "v".&nbsp; Should DTLS switch to using an analysis<br>more like the one presented here?&nbsp; (Or vice versa, of course.)</div></td>

I plan to<br>change my position to Yes once the Discuss points have been<br>appropriately discussed.&nbsp; My apologies in advance to the chairs who will<br>have to open github issues for all<br>of these!<br><br>We may want to make a pass through the document to normalize the way in<br>which we discuss 0-RTT.&nbsp; For example, Section 4.5 mentions that<br>resumption "can be used without also enabling 0-RTT" as if 0-RTT should<br>be off by default, but much of the previous discussion involving 0-RTT<br>treats it as an expected and normal part of the protocl.&nbsp; (For what<br>little it's worth, my own personal preference leans towards how <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a><br>treats 0-RTT data, as an optional and potentially dangerous thing that<br>should be off by default and only enabled after careful consideration,<br>though in some ways it actually seems significantly safer in QUIC than<br>TLS.&nbsp; Regardless, I do not see any value in re-litigating the question<br>at this point; I'm just hoping that the document can be consistent about<br>it.)<br><br>Abstract<br><br>I think this document also specifies some generic bits about how QUIC<br>uses cryptography, that are not directly related to TLS integration.<br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;

 *&nbsp; The TLS component provides a series of updates to the QUIC<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; component, including (a) new packet protection keys to install (b)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state changes such as handshake completion, the server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certificate, etc.<br><br>I think that if we're going to talk about passing the server certificate<br>between TLS and QUIC components, we should be very clear about where/how<br>certificate validation occurs.&nbsp; For example, it would be pretty<br>disasterous if TLS passed the certificate to QUIC expecting that QUIC<br>would do any validation of the peer identity, but QUIC assumed that TLS<br>would only provide a validated certificate.&nbsp; Perhaps in §4.1 when we<br>mention the potential for "additional functions [...] to configure TLS",<br>we might mention "including certificate validation", if appropriate?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC carries TLS handshake data in CRYPTO frames, each of which<br>&nbsp;  consists of a contiguous block of handshake data identified by an<br>&nbsp;  offset and length.&nbsp; Those frames are packaged into QUIC packets and<br>&nbsp;  encrypted under the current TLS encryption level.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the benefit of specifically calling this a<br>"TLS encryption level".&nbsp; While it's true that the keys are being<br>provided by TLS, the cryptographic mechanisms being used are applied by<br>QUIC.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's a 1:1 correspondence between the QUIC and<br>TLS encryption levels, so perhaps it is acceptable to not have a<br>qualifier at all (for just "under the current encryption level").<br><br>&nbsp;  One important difference between TLS records (used with TCP) and QUIC<br>&nbsp;  CRYPTO frames is that in QUIC multiple frames may appear in the same<br>&nbsp;  QUIC packet as long as they are associated with the same packet<br>&nbsp;  number space.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm a bit confused as to what analogy is being made here.&nbsp; It seems to<br>be equating TLS records and QUIC frames, but of course multiple DTLS<br>records can appear in a single UDP datagram, so the difference between<br>QUIC and DTLS does not seem quite so large as depicted here.&nbsp; Of course,<br>if the analogy is supposed to be between TLS handshake messages and QUIC<br>frames, or TLS records and QUIC packets, then things would be different,<br>but I'm not sure what this is intended to say.<br><br>Section 4.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the handshake is complete, TLS becomes passive.&nbsp; TLS can still<br>&nbsp;  receive data from its peer and respond in kind, but it will not need<br>&nbsp;  to send more data unless specifically requested - either by an<br>&nbsp;  application or QUIC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(pedantic note) In some sense this is a forward-looking statement *about<br>TLS*, which is not something the QUIC WG is chartered to work on.&nbsp; That<br>said, because of how TLS feature negotiation is done, any new kind of<br>data spontaneously emitted by TLS would need to be negotiated with an<br>extension in the handshake, but I don't think we are attempting to<br>specifically lock down the set of extensions in the TLS handshake for<br>QUIC connections, so in theory a change to the TLS implementation<br>defaults could result in QUIC connections that have TLS spontaneously<br>emit data.&nbsp; On the gripping hand, I don't really see much need for a<br>text change here.<br><br>Section 4.1.5<br><br>Why does the server call Get Handshake twice between receiving the<br>client Initial and the client's second Hansdhake flight?&nbsp; IIUC the<br>interface says that additional handshake data will only be supplied from<br>TLS in response to input handshake data (and thus, not in response to<br>TLS generating new keys, which is what the figure suggests to be a<br>proximal trigger for the second Get Handshake).&nbsp; We should probably be<br>careful that the interfaces we document are capable of describing the<br>case where TLS provides both new keys and handshake bytes, and the<br>handshake bytes are split across encryption levels (as is the case for<br>the server's first flight), which may be the motivation for the two Get<br>Handshake calls depicted here.<br><br>Similarly, it's my understanding that the client should still call Get<br>Handshake after receiving the Initial (but would receive only keys and<br>not output handshake data at that point).&nbsp; I'm not sure whether the<br>figure should indicate that (ineffectual) Get Handshake call.<br><br>Should the figure indicate the Handshake Confirmed operation in addition<br>to Handshake Complete?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello<br>&nbsp;  is sufficiently large.&nbsp; QUIC PADDING frames are added to increase the<br>&nbsp;  size of the packet as necessary.<br><br>Should we reference Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] for "sufficiently<br>large"?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  typically involves verification that the identity of the server is<br>&nbsp;  included in a certificate and that the certificate is issued by a<br>&nbsp;  trusted entity (see for example [<a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>]).<br><br>I assume that, per normal TLS semantics, this requirement can be met by<br>PSK authentication as well as certificate authentication.&nbsp; PSK<br>authentication has often been an aspect of TLS that has not received<br>substantial attention, so we may want to preemtively pay some attention<br>to the PSK case.<br><br>&nbsp;  A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as<br>&nbsp;  defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]), because the multiplexing<br><br>Do we want to say anything about not sending the "post_handshake_auth"<br>extension (defined in the numerologically similar section 4.2.6 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a>)?&nbsp; Strictly speaking we don't need to say anything, but efficient<br>implementations would satisfy the existing QUIC requirement by not<br>sending the extension and relying on the TLS stack to reject<br>post-handshake authentication since the extension had not been offered.<br><br>Section 4.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The alert level of all TLS alerts is "fatal"; a TLS stack MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  generate alerts at the "warning" level.<br><br>This seems to be making a normative restriction on the operation of TLS,<br>which is not in the QUIC WG charter.&nbsp; Perhaps we should instead<br>constrain the QUIC implementation to not accept such alerts (and what to<br>do if they are received) and note that the only closure alerts in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a> are "close_notify" and "user_cancelled", which are replaced by<br>equivalent QUIC-level functionality.<br><br>Section 4.9<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint cannot discard keys for a given encryption level unless<br>&nbsp;  it has both received and acknowledged all CRYPTO frames for that<br>&nbsp;  encryption level and when all CRYPTO frames for that encryption level<br>&nbsp;  have been acknowledged by its peer.&nbsp; However, this does not guarantee<br><br>(nit/editorial) I believe that the "both" is meant to apply to "received<br>and acknowledged" and "when all CRYTO frames [...] have been<br>acknowledged", but the current formulation does not have parallel<br>structure between those clauses, so it ends up reading more naturally as<br>saying that the "both" refers to "received" and "acknowledged".&nbsp; I don't<br>have a simple suggestion for fixing it, though (it might require a<br>significant restructuring to fix), so I'm leaving it here in my comments<br>rather than incorporating a fix into my editorial PR.&nbsp; (Any drastic<br>rewording might consider the rest of the paragraph as well, as it seems<br>to leave the reader without a clear sense for when it definitely is safe<br>to discard old keys.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Though an endpoint might retain older keys, new data MUST be sent at<br>&nbsp;  the highest currently-available encryption level.&nbsp; Only ACK frames<br>&nbsp;  and retransmissions of data in CRYPTO frames are sent at a previous<br>&nbsp;  encryption level.&nbsp; These packets MAY also include PADDING frames.<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about whether it is advisable to make<br>retransmission packets have the same size as the original transmission?<br>("No" is a fine answer.)<br><br>Section 4.9.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 *&nbsp; Retry packets use AEAD_AES_128_GCM to provide protection against<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accidental modification or insertion by off-path adversaries; see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 5.8.<br><br>[As noted by others, please check the terminology here against<br>[QUIC-TRANSPORT]; I think the latter uses "attacker" rather than<br>"adversary" and I haven't internalized the new on-path, limited on-path,<br>off-path terminology yet, either.]<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; All other packets have strong cryptographic protections for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; confidentiality and integrity, using keys and algorithms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negotiated by TLS.<br><br>(side note) the handshake keys are "strong" in a certain sense<br>(unpredictability) but weak in the sense that they are not authenticated<br>until the handshake has completed.&nbsp; It may not be necessary to attempt<br>to express this subtlety in this point in the document, though.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>I think we should say something about the "Context" argument to<br>HKDF-Expand-Label here.&nbsp; (I assume it is going to be the same<br>Transcript-Hash as used for TLS 1.3, but it is not currently specified,<br>as far as I can see.&nbsp; I do note that we have some ongoing discussion in<br>the context of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/">draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13</a> that *exporters*, at least,<br>might better have been specified to use the full transcript including<br>client Finished, but I am not convinced that we should consider such<br>drastic changes for our usage, especially since it would neuter 0.5-RTT<br>unless we add a lot more complexity.)&nbsp; We may also want to say that<br>the Length input is determined by the ciphersuite's requirements.<br>Alternately we could specify in terms of Derive-Secret(), but there's<br>not really a clear incentive to do so.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This secret is determined by using HKDF-Extract (see Section 2.2 of<br>&nbsp;  [HKDF]) with a salt of 0x38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a and<br>&nbsp;  a IKM of the Destination Connection ID field.&nbsp; This produces an<br>&nbsp;  intermediate pseudorandom key (PRK) that is used to derive two<br>&nbsp;  separate secrets for sending and receiving.<br><br>[I was going to say something about all-zeros providing the same level<br>of cryptographic protection, but then I saw the discussion at<br><a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325</a> and the note further<br>down that new versions of QUIC should pick different salt values.]<br>I assume this holds for the final RFC version as compared to the I-Ds,<br>and <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711</a> suggests that a new<br>(random) salt should be chosen for the final RFC version, but I didn't<br>see an open issue in github for it, so I'll mention it here just in case<br>that helps.&nbsp;

(The idea would be to hew to the TLS 1.3<br>terminology where specific named Secrets are used to drive<br>Derive-Secret() calls but other cryptographic inputs are not named with<br>the word "secret".)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC can use any of the cipher suites defined in [TLS13] with the<br>&nbsp;  exception of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's a little interesting to use the RFC as the authority on<br>ciphersuites rather than the registry, but I guess the header protection<br>scheme requirement makes it more reasonable.&nbsp; Also, for what it's worth,<br>there are MAC-only TLS 1.3 ciphersuites in the IANA registry.&nbsp; I don't<br>know whether you want to say anything (to forbid?) such things from<br>being used as QUIC AEADs.<br><br>Section 5.4.x<br><br>Are we really sure that we want to use normative pseudocode?&nbsp; I thought<br>(but cannot currently substantiate) that we typically preferred<br>normative prose and example pseudocode, since pseudocode somewhat<br>intrinsically has not-fully-specified semantics.&nbsp; As some specific (but<br>not comprehensive!) examples, which bytes of the mask are used when the<br>packet number is encoded in fewer than 4 bytes, and the key/plaintext<br>inputs to AES-ECB seem to only be specified in the pseudocode.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Once an endpoint successfully receives a packet with a given packet<br>&nbsp;  number, it MUST discard all packets in the same packet number space<br>&nbsp;  with higher packet numbers if they cannot be successfully unprotected<br>&nbsp;  with either the same key, or - if there is a key update - the next<br>&nbsp;  packet protection key (see Section 6).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Pedantically, "the next packet protection key" seems to imply<br>specifically the one next key, not "any subsequent key".&nbsp; A strict<br>reading of this text would thust require discarding all packets received<br>after a second key update, because this clause applies to the very first<br>packet successfully received, and the third key used is neither the<br>"same" or "next" key, from that reference point.&nbsp; (I note that in §6.4<br>we merely talk about "either the same or newer packet protection keys".)<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Of the frames defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the STREAM, RESET_STREAM,<br>&nbsp;  and CONNECTION_CLOSE frames are potentially unsafe for use with 0-RTT<br>&nbsp;  as they carry application data.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I guess STOP_SENDING is not listed as unsafe because it would be an<br>error to send it in 0-RTT anyway?<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  The requirement for the server to wait for the client Finished<br>&nbsp;  message creates a dependency on that message being delivered.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  client can avoid the potential for head-of-line blocking that this<br>&nbsp;  implies by sending its 1-RTT packets coalesced with a Handshake<br>&nbsp;  packet containing a copy of the CRYPTO frame that carries the<br>&nbsp;  Finished message, until one of the Handshake packets is acknowledged.<br>&nbsp;  This enables immediate server processing for those packets.<br><br>This mostly only helps for unauthenticated clients, since for<br>authenticated clients the Finishsed isn't much good without the<br>Certificate+CertificateVerify, which are probably too big to include<br>with every packet.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The secret key and the nonce are values derived by calling HKDF-<br>&nbsp;  Expand-Label using<br>&nbsp;  0xd9c9943e6101fd200021506bcc02814c73030f25c79d71ce876eca876e6fca8e as<br>&nbsp;  the secret, with labels being "quic key" and "quic iv" (Section 5.1).<br><br>HKDF-Expand-Label also takes a "Context" argument; what value is used<br>for that?&nbsp; (Presumably the ouput Length argument is set to the lengths<br>of the stated fields.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Retry Pseudo-Packet {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;  ODCID Length (8),<br>&nbsp;

read keys are updated at the same time that<br>write keys are (and vice versa).<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The process of creating new packet protection keys for receiving<br>&nbsp;  packets could reveal that a key update has occurred.&nbsp; An endpoint MAY<br>&nbsp;  perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a<br>&nbsp;  timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key<br>&nbsp;  updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints MAY instead defer the creation of the next set of<br>&nbsp;  receive packet protection keys until some time after a key update<br>&nbsp;  completes, up to three times the PTO; see Section 6.5.<br><br>(editorial) I think this paragraph (and following) might need a rewrite,<br>since the phrase "new keys" in the context of a key update could be<br>ambiguous.&nbsp; In particular, if we are considering the process of a key<br>update from generation M to generation N, this text only seems to make<br>sense if the "new keys" whose generation is being discussed is<br>generation O (i.e., ones that are not being used to send traffic yet by<br>anybody), but it is easy to misread "new keys" as being "the ones<br>installed/activated for use as part of the key update process".&nbsp; Perhaps<br>the guidance that endpoints are to maintain both current and next keys<br>in normal operation should be moved earlier, with the context that you<br>need to be prepared to handle any valid incoming packets (which includes<br>those using both current and next keys, since the peer can initiate a<br>key update) without a timing channel for when key generation is<br>occurring.&nbsp; (There may be some similar text in §9.5 that would be<br>updated in accordance with any changes made here.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  retained, even if the packet that was received was subsequently<br>&nbsp;  discarded.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>What is "the packet" that was received?<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout<br>&nbsp;  (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after receiving a packet that uses the new<br>&nbsp;  key generation before it creates the next set of packet protection<br>&nbsp;  keys.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(editorial) Similarly to the previous section, I think the action being<br>described here might be more properly described as "promoting the 'next'<br>keys to be the 'current' keys (and thus starting the precomputation for<br>the subsequent 'next' keys)".&nbsp; Surly this is not advocating waiting a<br>PTO before generating the keys you need to process a packet you just<br>received ... right?<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The usage limits defined in TLS 1.3 exist for protection against<br>&nbsp;  attacks on confidentiality and apply to successful applications of<br>&nbsp;  AEAD protection.&nbsp; The integrity protections in authenticated<br>&nbsp;  encryption also depend on limiting the number of attempts to forge<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; TLS achieves this by closing connections after any record<br>&nbsp;  fails an authentication check.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC ignores any<br>&nbsp;  packet that cannot be authenticated, allowing multiple forgery<br>&nbsp;  attempts.<br><br>QUIC seems very analogous to DTLS in this regard, and DTLS 1.3 also has<br>similar text about AEAD limits for integrity.&nbsp; Perhaps a brief mention<br>that they are essentially the same is useful?<br><br>&nbsp;  For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit<br>&nbsp;  is 2^23 encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, the confidentiality limit is greater than the<br>&nbsp;  number of possible packets (2^62) and so can be disregarded.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^21.5 encrypted<br>&nbsp;  packets; see Appendix B.2.&nbsp; Applying a limit reduces the probability<br>&nbsp;  that an attacker can distinguish the AEAD in use from a random<br>&nbsp;  permutation; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST], and [GCM-MU].<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; These limits were originally calculated using assumptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about the limits on TLS record size.&nbsp; The maximum size of a TLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; record is 2^14 bytes.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC packets can be up to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2^16 bytes.&nbsp; However, it is expected that QUIC packets will<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generally be smaller than TLS records.&nbsp; Where packets might be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; larger than 2^14 bytes in length, smaller limits might be needed.<br><br>(This seems to say that we're just reusing the TLS numbers even though<br>in theory we do allow larger packets.&nbsp; But if that's the case, why do<br>the actual numbers we present differ from the ones given for DTLS 1.3?<br>The actual text in Appendix B suggests that we are not actually reusing<br>the TLS numbers (since we use different estimates for l, and<br>furthermore, that [GCM-MU] allows larger limits than [AEBounds] as used<br>by TLS 1.3).)<br><br>&nbsp;  Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define<br>&nbsp;  limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves<br>&nbsp;  margins for confidentiality and integrity.&nbsp; That is, limits MUST be<br>&nbsp;  specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for<br>&nbsp;  the number of packets that can fail authentication.&nbsp; Providing a<br>&nbsp;  reference to any analysis upon which values are based - and any<br>&nbsp;  assumptions used in that analysis - allows limits to be adapted to<br>&nbsp;  varying usage conditions.<br><br>DTLS 1.3 imposes essentially the same requirement.&nbsp; IIUC it would be<br>acceptable to use the same limit for DTLS 1.3 and for QUIC, and we<br>should perhaps say that if a cipher is allowed for one it is allowed for<br>the other (with the same limit), though on second though, we really do<br>want the analysis to take into account the different assumptions about<br>the number of blocks in a packet..<br><br>Section 9<br><br>In various places (e.g., §4.1.4) we recommend to buffer (or "retain")<br>data that cannot be processed yet.&nbsp; Perhaps it goes without saying, but<br>such buffering needs limits in place in order to avoid DoS.<br><br>It may be too banal to mention again here that the Initial secret/keys<br>are not particularly secure, but I'll mention it just in case we want<br>to.<br><br>Section 9.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The initial secrets use a key that is specific to the negotiated QUIC<br>&nbsp;  version.&nbsp; New QUIC versions SHOULD define a new salt value used in<br>&nbsp;  calculating initial secrets.<br><br>Also for the Retry Integrity Tag key/nonce secret?<br><br>Appendix A.1, A.5<br><br>I think that <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> has us write just "" instead of _ to indicate a<br>zero-length Context.&nbsp;

(I actually had trouble matching up any of the formulae<br>in the paper with the ones here due to different variable names, and ran<br>out of time to dig further.)<br><br>Appendix B.2<br><br>&nbsp;  TLS [TLS13] and [AEBounds] do not specify limits on usage for<br>&nbsp;

 attempts with the same limit as that produced by the theorem for<br>&nbsp;  confidentiality alone.&nbsp; For a target advantage of 2^-57, this results<br>&nbsp;  in:<br><br>&nbsp;  v + q &lt;= 2^34.5 / l<br><br>&nbsp;  By setting "q = v", values for both confidentiality and integrity<br>&nbsp;  limits can be produced.&nbsp; Endpoints that limit packets to 2^11 bytes<br>&nbsp;  therefore have both confidentiality and integrity limits of 2^26.5<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints that do not restrict packet size have a limit of<br>&nbsp;  2^21.5.<br><br>DTLS currently has text that does a dedicated computation for "q" and<br>then substitutes that established value into this last formula to<br>determine the limit for "v".&nbsp; Should DTLS switch to using an analysis<br>more like the one presented here?&nbsp; (Or vice versa, of course.)</div></td>

For example, it would be pretty<br>disasterous if TLS passed the certificate to QUIC expecting that QUIC<br>would do any validation of the peer identity, but QUIC assumed that TLS<br>would only provide a validated certificate.&nbsp; Perhaps in §4.1 when we<br>mention the potential for "additional functions [...] to configure TLS",<br>we might mention "including certificate validation", if appropriate?<br><br>Section 4<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC carries TLS handshake data in CRYPTO frames, each of which<br>&nbsp;  consists of a contiguous block of handshake data identified by an<br>&nbsp;  offset and length.&nbsp; Those frames are packaged into QUIC packets and<br>&nbsp;  encrypted under the current TLS encryption level.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand the benefit of specifically calling this a<br>"TLS encryption level".&nbsp; While it's true that the keys are being<br>provided by TLS, the cryptographic mechanisms being used are applied by<br>QUIC.&nbsp; Furthermore, there's a 1:1 correspondence between the QUIC and<br>TLS encryption levels, so perhaps it is acceptable to not have a<br>qualifier at all (for just "under the current encryption level").<br><br>&nbsp;  One important difference between TLS records (used with TCP) and QUIC<br>&nbsp;  CRYPTO frames is that in QUIC multiple frames may appear in the same<br>&nbsp;  QUIC packet as long as they are associated with the same packet<br>&nbsp;  number space.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm a bit confused as to what analogy is being made here.&nbsp; It seems to<br>be equating TLS records and QUIC frames, but of course multiple DTLS<br>records can appear in a single UDP datagram, so the difference between<br>QUIC and DTLS does not seem quite so large as depicted here.&nbsp; Of course,<br>if the analogy is supposed to be between TLS handshake messages and QUIC<br>frames, or TLS records and QUIC packets, then things would be different,<br>but I'm not sure what this is intended to say.<br><br>Section 4.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  Once the handshake is complete, TLS becomes passive.&nbsp; TLS can still<br>&nbsp;  receive data from its peer and respond in kind, but it will not need<br>&nbsp;  to send more data unless specifically requested - either by an<br>&nbsp;  application or QUIC.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(pedantic note) In some sense this is a forward-looking statement *about<br>TLS*, which is not something the QUIC WG is chartered to work on.&nbsp; That<br>said, because of how TLS feature negotiation is done, any new kind of<br>data spontaneously emitted by TLS would need to be negotiated with an<br>extension in the handshake, but I don't think we are attempting to<br>specifically lock down the set of extensions in the TLS handshake for<br>QUIC connections, so in theory a change to the TLS implementation<br>defaults could result in QUIC connections that have TLS spontaneously<br>emit data.&nbsp; On the gripping hand, I don't really see much need for a<br>text change here.<br><br>Section 4.1.5<br><br>Why does the server call Get Handshake twice between receiving the<br>client Initial and the client's second Hansdhake flight?&nbsp; IIUC the<br>interface says that additional handshake data will only be supplied from<br>TLS in response to input handshake data (and thus, not in response to<br>TLS generating new keys, which is what the figure suggests to be a<br>proximal trigger for the second Get Handshake).&nbsp; We should probably be<br>careful that the interfaces we document are capable of describing the<br>case where TLS provides both new keys and handshake bytes, and the<br>handshake bytes are split across encryption levels (as is the case for<br>the server's first flight), which may be the motivation for the two Get<br>Handshake calls depicted here.<br><br>Similarly, it's my understanding that the client should still call Get<br>Handshake after receiving the Initial (but would receive only keys and<br>not output handshake data at that point).&nbsp; I'm not sure whether the<br>figure should indicate that (ineffectual) Get Handshake call.<br><br>Should the figure indicate the Handshake Confirmed operation in addition<br>to Handshake Complete?<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The TLS implementation does not need to ensure that the ClientHello<br>&nbsp;  is sufficiently large.&nbsp; QUIC PADDING frames are added to increase the<br>&nbsp;  size of the packet as necessary.<br><br>Should we reference Section 8.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] for "sufficiently<br>large"?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  A client MUST authenticate the identity of the server.&nbsp; This<br>&nbsp;  typically involves verification that the identity of the server is<br>&nbsp;  included in a certificate and that the certificate is issued by a<br>&nbsp;  trusted entity (see for example [<a href="/doc/rfc2818/">RFC2818</a>]).<br><br>I assume that, per normal TLS semantics, this requirement can be met by<br>PSK authentication as well as certificate authentication.&nbsp; PSK<br>authentication has often been an aspect of TLS that has not received<br>substantial attention, so we may want to preemtively pay some attention<br>to the PSK case.<br><br>&nbsp;  A server MUST NOT use post-handshake client authentication (as<br>&nbsp;  defined in Section 4.6.2 of [TLS13]), because the multiplexing<br><br>Do we want to say anything about not sending the "post_handshake_auth"<br>extension (defined in the numerologically similar section 4.2.6 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a>)?&nbsp; Strictly speaking we don't need to say anything, but efficient<br>implementations would satisfy the existing QUIC requirement by not<br>sending the extension and relying on the TLS stack to reject<br>post-handshake authentication since the extension had not been offered.<br><br>Section 4.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The alert level of all TLS alerts is "fatal"; a TLS stack MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  generate alerts at the "warning" level.<br><br>This seems to be making a normative restriction on the operation of TLS,<br>which is not in the QUIC WG charter.&nbsp; Perhaps we should instead<br>constrain the QUIC implementation to not accept such alerts (and what to<br>do if they are received) and note that the only closure alerts in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a> are "close_notify" and "user_cancelled", which are replaced by<br>equivalent QUIC-level functionality.<br><br>Section 4.9<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint cannot discard keys for a given encryption level unless<br>&nbsp;  it has both received and acknowledged all CRYPTO frames for that<br>&nbsp;  encryption level and when all CRYPTO frames for that encryption level<br>&nbsp;  have been acknowledged by its peer.&nbsp; However, this does not guarantee<br><br>(nit/editorial) I believe that the "both" is meant to apply to "received<br>and acknowledged" and "when all CRYTO frames [...] have been<br>acknowledged", but the current formulation does not have parallel<br>structure between those clauses, so it ends up reading more naturally as<br>saying that the "both" refers to "received" and "acknowledged".&nbsp; I don't<br>have a simple suggestion for fixing it, though (it might require a<br>significant restructuring to fix), so I'm leaving it here in my comments<br>rather than incorporating a fix into my editorial PR.&nbsp; (Any drastic<br>rewording might consider the rest of the paragraph as well, as it seems<br>to leave the reader without a clear sense for when it definitely is safe<br>to discard old keys.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Though an endpoint might retain older keys, new data MUST be sent at<br>&nbsp;  the highest currently-available encryption level.&nbsp; Only ACK frames<br>&nbsp;  and retransmissions of data in CRYPTO frames are sent at a previous<br>&nbsp;  encryption level.&nbsp; These packets MAY also include PADDING frames.<br><br>Is there anything useful to say about whether it is advisable to make<br>retransmission packets have the same size as the original transmission?<br>("No" is a fine answer.)<br><br>Section 4.9.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 the RECOMMENDED time period is three times the Probe Timeout (PTO,<br>&nbsp;  see [QUIC-RECOVERY]).&nbsp; A server MAY discard 0-RTT keys earlier if it<br><br>Just to check my understanding, the two endpoints will not necessarily<br>agree on the value of PTO at any given point in time, so this is a<br>heuristic and not some form of synchronized behavior where the server<br>replicates the client's loss-detection algorithm precisely?<br><br>Section 5<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Retry packets use AEAD_AES_128_GCM to provide protection against<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accidental modification or insertion by off-path adversaries; see<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Section 5.8.<br><br>[As noted by others, please check the terminology here against<br>[QUIC-TRANSPORT]; I think the latter uses "attacker" rather than<br>"adversary" and I haven't internalized the new on-path, limited on-path,<br>off-path terminology yet, either.]<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; All other packets have strong cryptographic protections for<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; confidentiality and integrity, using keys and algorithms<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; negotiated by TLS.<br><br>(side note) the handshake keys are "strong" in a certain sense<br>(unpredictability) but weak in the sense that they are not authenticated<br>until the handshake has completed.&nbsp; It may not be necessary to attempt<br>to express this subtlety in this point in the document, though.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>I think we should say something about the "Context" argument to<br>HKDF-Expand-Label here.&nbsp; (I assume it is going to be the same<br>Transcript-Hash as used for TLS 1.3, but it is not currently specified,<br>as far as I can see.&nbsp; I do note that we have some ongoing discussion in<br>the context of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/">draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13</a> that *exporters*, at least,<br>might better have been specified to use the full transcript including<br>client Finished, but I am not convinced that we should consider such<br>drastic changes for our usage, especially since it would neuter 0.5-RTT<br>unless we add a lot more complexity.)&nbsp; We may also want to say that<br>the Length input is determined by the ciphersuite's requirements.<br>Alternately we could specify in terms of Derive-Secret(), but there's<br>not really a clear incentive to do so.<br><br>Section 5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  This secret is determined by using HKDF-Extract (see Section 2.2 of<br>&nbsp;  [HKDF]) with a salt of 0x38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a and<br>&nbsp;  a IKM of the Destination Connection ID field.&nbsp; This produces an<br>&nbsp;  intermediate pseudorandom key (PRK) that is used to derive two<br>&nbsp;  separate secrets for sending and receiving.<br><br>[I was going to say something about all-zeros providing the same level<br>of cryptographic protection, but then I saw the discussion at<br><a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/4325</a> and the note further<br>down that new versions of QUIC should pick different salt values.]<br>I assume this holds for the final RFC version as compared to the I-Ds,<br>and <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711">https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/3711</a> suggests that a new<br>(random) salt should be chosen for the final RFC version, but I didn't<br>see an open issue in github for it, so I'll mention it here just in case<br>that helps.&nbsp;

(The idea would be to hew to the TLS 1.3<br>terminology where specific named Secrets are used to drive<br>Derive-Secret() calls but other cryptographic inputs are not named with<br>the word "secret".)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>&nbsp;  QUIC can use any of the cipher suites defined in [TLS13] with the<br>&nbsp;  exception of TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's a little interesting to use the RFC as the authority on<br>ciphersuites rather than the registry, but I guess the header protection<br>scheme requirement makes it more reasonable.&nbsp; Also, for what it's worth,<br>there are MAC-only TLS 1.3 ciphersuites in the IANA registry.&nbsp; I don't<br>know whether you want to say anything (to forbid?) such things from<br>being used as QUIC AEADs.<br><br>Section 5.4.x<br><br>Are we really sure that we want to use normative pseudocode?&nbsp; I thought<br>(but cannot currently substantiate) that we typically preferred<br>normative prose and example pseudocode, since pseudocode somewhat<br>intrinsically has not-fully-specified semantics.&nbsp; As some specific (but<br>not comprehensive!) examples, which bytes of the mask are used when the<br>packet number is encoded in fewer than 4 bytes, and the key/plaintext<br>inputs to AES-ECB seem to only be specified in the pseudocode.<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Once an endpoint successfully receives a packet with a given packet<br>&nbsp;  number, it MUST discard all packets in the same packet number space<br>&nbsp;  with higher packet numbers if they cannot be successfully unprotected<br>&nbsp;  with either the same key, or - if there is a key update - the next<br>&nbsp;  packet protection key (see Section 6).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Pedantically, "the next packet protection key" seems to imply<br>specifically the one next key, not "any subsequent key".&nbsp; A strict<br>reading of this text would thust require discarding all packets received<br>after a second key update, because this clause applies to the very first<br>packet successfully received, and the third key used is neither the<br>"same" or "next" key, from that reference point.&nbsp; (I note that in §6.4<br>we merely talk about "either the same or newer packet protection keys".)<br><br>Section 5.6<br><br>&nbsp;  Of the frames defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the STREAM, RESET_STREAM,<br>&nbsp;

 The requirement for the server to wait for the client Finished<br>&nbsp;  message creates a dependency on that message being delivered.&nbsp; A<br>&nbsp;  client can avoid the potential for head-of-line blocking that this<br>&nbsp;  implies by sending its 1-RTT packets coalesced with a Handshake<br>&nbsp;  packet containing a copy of the CRYPTO frame that carries the<br>&nbsp;  Finished message, until one of the Handshake packets is acknowledged.<br>&nbsp;  This enables immediate server processing for those packets.<br><br>This mostly only helps for unauthenticated clients, since for<br>authenticated clients the Finishsed isn't much good without the<br>Certificate+CertificateVerify, which are probably too big to include<br>with every packet.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  The secret key and the nonce are values derived by calling HKDF-<br>&nbsp;  Expand-Label using<br>&nbsp;  0xd9c9943e6101fd200021506bcc02814c73030f25c79d71ce876eca876e6fca8e as<br>&nbsp;  the secret, with labels being "quic key" and "quic iv" (Section 5.1).<br><br>HKDF-Expand-Label also takes a "Context" argument;

read keys are updated at the same time that<br>write keys are (and vice versa).<br><br>Section 6.3<br><br>&nbsp;  The process of creating new packet protection keys for receiving<br>&nbsp;  packets could reveal that a key update has occurred.&nbsp; An endpoint MAY<br>&nbsp;  perform this process as part of packet processing, but this creates a<br>&nbsp;  timing signal that can be used by an attacker to learn when key<br>&nbsp;  updates happen and thus the value of the Key Phase bit in certain<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; Endpoints MAY instead defer the creation of the next set of<br>&nbsp;  receive packet protection keys until some time after a key update<br>&nbsp;  completes, up to three times the PTO; see Section 6.5.<br><br>(editorial) I think this paragraph (and following) might need a rewrite,<br>since the phrase "new keys" in the context of a key update could be<br>ambiguous.&nbsp; In particular, if we are considering the process of a key<br>update from generation M to generation N, this text only seems to make<br>sense if the "new keys" whose generation is being discussed is<br>generation O (i.e., ones that are not being used to send traffic yet by<br>anybody), but it is easy to misread "new keys" as being "the ones<br>installed/activated for use as part of the key update process".&nbsp; Perhaps<br>the guidance that endpoints are to maintain both current and next keys<br>in normal operation should be moved earlier, with the context that you<br>need to be prepared to handle any valid incoming packets (which includes<br>those using both current and next keys, since the peer can initiate a<br>key update) without a timing channel for when key generation is<br>occurring.&nbsp; (There may be some similar text in §9.5 that would be<br>updated in accordance with any changes made here.)<br><br>&nbsp;  Once generated, the next set of packet protection keys SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  retained, even if the packet that was received was subsequently<br>&nbsp;  discarded.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>What is "the packet" that was received?<br><br>Section 6.5<br><br>&nbsp;  An endpoint MAY allow a period of approximately the Probe Timeout<br>&nbsp;  (PTO; see [QUIC-RECOVERY]) after receiving a packet that uses the new<br>&nbsp;  key generation before it creates the next set of packet protection<br>&nbsp;  keys.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>(editorial) Similarly to the previous section, I think the action being<br>described here might be more properly described as "promoting the 'next'<br>keys to be the 'current' keys (and thus starting the precomputation for<br>the subsequent 'next' keys)".&nbsp; Surly this is not advocating waiting a<br>PTO before generating the keys you need to process a packet you just<br>received ... right?<br><br>Section 6.6<br><br>&nbsp;  The usage limits defined in TLS 1.3 exist for protection against<br>&nbsp;  attacks on confidentiality and apply to successful applications of<br>&nbsp;  AEAD protection.&nbsp; The integrity protections in authenticated<br>&nbsp;  encryption also depend on limiting the number of attempts to forge<br>&nbsp;  packets.&nbsp; TLS achieves this by closing connections after any record<br>&nbsp;  fails an authentication check.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC ignores any<br>&nbsp;  packet that cannot be authenticated, allowing multiple forgery<br>&nbsp;  attempts.<br><br>QUIC seems very analogous to DTLS in this regard, and DTLS 1.3 also has<br>similar text about AEAD limits for integrity.&nbsp; Perhaps a brief mention<br>that they are essentially the same is useful?<br><br>&nbsp;  For AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit<br>&nbsp;  is 2^23 encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305, the confidentiality limit is greater than the<br>&nbsp;  number of possible packets (2^62) and so can be disregarded.&nbsp; For<br>&nbsp;  AEAD_AES_128_CCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^21.5 encrypted<br>&nbsp;  packets; see Appendix B.2.&nbsp; Applying a limit reduces the probability<br>&nbsp;  that an attacker can distinguish the AEAD in use from a random<br>&nbsp;  permutation; see [AEBounds], [ROBUST], and [GCM-MU].<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  Note:&nbsp; These limits were originally calculated using assumptions<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; about the limits on TLS record size.&nbsp; The maximum size of a TLS<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; record is 2^14 bytes.&nbsp; In comparison, QUIC packets can be up to<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2^16 bytes.&nbsp; However, it is expected that QUIC packets will<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; generally be smaller than TLS records.&nbsp; Where packets might be<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; larger than 2^14 bytes in length, smaller limits might be needed.<br><br>(This seems to say that we're just reusing the TLS numbers even though<br>in theory we do allow larger packets.&nbsp; But if that's the case, why do<br>the actual numbers we present differ from the ones given for DTLS 1.3?<br>The actual text in Appendix B suggests that we are not actually reusing<br>the TLS numbers (since we use different estimates for l, and<br>furthermore, that [GCM-MU] allows larger limits than [AEBounds] as used<br>by TLS 1.3).)<br><br>&nbsp;  Any TLS cipher suite that is specified for use with QUIC MUST define<br>&nbsp;  limits on the use of the associated AEAD function that preserves<br>&nbsp;  margins for confidentiality and integrity.&nbsp; That is, limits MUST be<br>&nbsp;  specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and for<br>&nbsp;  the number of packets that can fail authentication.&nbsp; Providing a<br>&nbsp;  reference to any analysis upon which values are based - and any<br>&nbsp;  assumptions used in that analysis - allows limits to be adapted to<br>&nbsp;  varying usage conditions.<br><br>DTLS 1.3 imposes essentially the same requirement.&nbsp; IIUC it would be<br>acceptable to use the same limit for DTLS 1.3 and for QUIC, and we<br>should perhaps say that if a cipher is allowed for one it is allowed for<br>the other (with the same limit), though on second though, we really do<br>want the analysis to take into account the different assumptions about<br>the number of blocks in a packet..<br><br>Section 9<br><br>In various places (e.g., §4.1.4) we recommend to buffer (or "retain")<br>data that cannot be processed yet.&nbsp;

In 8.2 it says that the TPs are "available" but "not fully trusted" before completion. The latter is certainly true; but the server can't send 0.5-RTT packets (e.g. a SETTINGS frame) without any indication of the client transport parameters. I would suggest a clarification in 4.1.3 and letting the language in 8.2 stand.<br><br>- 5.8 says the ODCID field "mitigates an off-path attacker's ability to inject a Retry".<br><br>First, in quic-transport you defined an off-path attacker (21.1) as someone who can observe but not alter packets. I don't think that's what you mean here, so please use another a term here or explicitly define what you mean in this document. Come to think of it, there are some inconsistent usages of this term in quic-transport as well (14.2.1,17.2.1, 17.2.2 )<br><br>Secondly, it is not clear to me what protection this offers beyond the DCID field in the actual Retry Packet (which corresponds to the SCID of the Initial).</div></td>
