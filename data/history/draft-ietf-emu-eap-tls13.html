Are we adding to the end,<br>prepending to the beginning, replacing wholesale, replacing in part, or<br>doing something else to the indicated text of <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a>?&nbsp; I expect that<br>just tweaking a few words can resolve the ambiguity, but am not sure<br>which ones yet.<br><br>It is also interesting to contrast the "amending" language with what we<br>say in Sections 2.1.4 and 2.3 about "replacing" text from <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> and<br>the various places where we report a "new section when compared to<br>[<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>]".<br>======================================================================<br><br>The discussion helped shed some light on the process the WG took to get<br>to the current state of having an amalgamation of new and existing text<br>where the new text amends the existing text in a way that has the reader<br>perform their own synthesis, avoiding a need for specification authors to<br>engage in a tedious exercise of going sentence-by-sentence to check all<br>the details.<br><br>I would suggest to make a change of the form:<br><br>OLD:<br>updates Section X of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] by amending it with the following text<br><br>NEW:<br>updates Section X of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] by amending it in accordance with the following<br>discussion<br><br><br>Original COMMENT section retained unchanged:<br>======================================================================<br>I echo the sentiments of other reviewers that constructing EAP-TLS 1.3<br>as something of a diff against <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> will make it harder to<br>eventually deprecate/obsolete/etc <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> and makes it somewhat<br>challenging to read the EAP-TLS 1.3 specification as a whole.&nbsp; That<br>said, this is just the comment section, so I am not strenuously<br>objecting to it.<br><br>As another general note, in many places the phrasings used to describe<br>TLS 1.3 behaviors feel rather un-idiomatic to me, based on my experience<br>with TLS and TLS specifications.&nbsp; That said, the behavior seems<br>well-specified as is, so I don't propose to make any changes in response<br>to this comment.&nbsp; If there is demand, I could probably be persuaded to<br>suggest alternative text, but I don't expect much demand at this stage<br>in the document's lifecycle.<br><br>I made a github PR with some editorial suggestions:<br><a href="https://github.com/emu-wg/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/pull/92">https://github.com/emu-wg/draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls13/pull/92</a><br><br>Section 2.1<br><br>&nbsp;  This section updates Section 2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] by amending it with the<br>&nbsp;  following text.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  TLS 1.3 changes both the message flow and the handshake messages<br>&nbsp;  compared to earlier versions of TLS.&nbsp; Therefore, much of Section 2.1<br>&nbsp;  of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] does not apply for TLS 1.3.&nbsp; Except for Sections 2.2 and<br>&nbsp;  5.7 this document applies only when TLS 1.3 is negotiated.&nbsp; When TLS<br>&nbsp;  1.2 is negotiated, then [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] applies.<br><br>There is perhaps some philosophical question of what "this document"<br>means in the context of an updated collection of text that includes <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC<br>5216</a> and the text that is being amended as directed here.&nbsp; I hope that<br>the RFC Editor will have some thoughts on this matter, but perhaps<br>s/this document/[RFCXXXX]/ would reduce ambiguity.&nbsp; If this change is<br>made, there would be similar/corresponding changes later on as well,<br>e.g., whenever the amended text includes a section reference to this<br>document, it would be "Section 2.1.3 of [RFCXXXX]".<br><br>Also, I think that both Sections 5.6 and 5.7 (not just 5.7) are marked<br>as applying to EAP-TLS in general.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Early Data MUST NOT be used in EAP-TLS.&nbsp; EAP-TLS servers MUST NOT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; send an early_data extension and clients MUST NOT send an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EndOfEarlyData message.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn't include the last sentence, as both requirements<br>follow naturally from the previous requirement.&nbsp; It feels a little<br>surprising to make reference to the specific message-level requirements<br>on the TLS stack, though I won't object to keeping this text if the<br>authors/WG find it important.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Servers MUST NOT request post-handshake client authentication.<br><br>Do we want to make any statement about the client (not) sending the<br>"post_handshake_auth" extension (which the client must do as a<br>prerequisite of the server requesting post-handshake client<br>authentication)?<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  After the EAP-TLS server<br>&nbsp;  has sent an EAP-Request containing the TLS application data 0x00 and<br>&nbsp;  received an EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type=EAP-TLS and no data, the<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS server sends EAP-Success.<br><br>I think in some sense the EAP-Server also needs to not have additional<br>TLS data do send in order to declare success and send EAP-Success.<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  full handshake.&nbsp; In the case a full handshake is required, the<br>&nbsp;  negotiation proceeds as if the session was a new authentication, and<br>&nbsp;  resumption had never been requested.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I put a suggested alternative phrasing in my editorial PR, but wanted to<br>note the reasoning for the change in my ballot comment here.<br>"Had never been requested" is perhaps problematic in that the request<br>for resumption is encoded in the ClientHello, and to say that it had<br>never happened seems a little like suggesting that the ClientHello is<br>modified (which is not what happens).<br><br>&nbsp;  Figure 3 shows an example message flow for a subsequent successful<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS resumption handshake where both sides authenticate via a PSK<br>&nbsp;  provisioned via an earlier NewSessionTicket and where the server<br>&nbsp;  provisions a single new ticket.<br><br>I would suggest indicating that the TLS ClientHello includes the<br>"pre_shared_key" extension to help differentiate the resumption<br>handshake from the full handshake depicted in Figures 1/2.<br><br>&nbsp;  When using "psk_dhe_ke", TLS 1.3 provides forward secrecy meaning<br>&nbsp;  that key leakage does not compromise any earlier connections.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's probably worth saying which key is leaked to trigger the "key<br>leakage" scenario being described.<br><br>Section 2.1.8<br><br>I might consider noting that the "hello_request" message doesn't exist<br>in TLS 1.3, so the <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> procedures are inherently inapplicable with<br>TLS 1.3.&nbsp; On the other hand, that might be covered by the blanket<br>statement in §2.1, and thus unneeded here.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The EAP peer identity provided in the EAP-Response/Identity is not<br>&nbsp;  authenticated by EAP-TLS.&nbsp; Unauthenticated information MUST NOT be<br>&nbsp;  used for accounting purposes or to give authorization.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>There's some analogous text in 5216 that talks about use for "accounting<br>purposes" or "access control" (at the SHOULD NOT level) -- is there a<br>reason to use/not use the same phrasing that 5216 did?<br><br>&nbsp;  (SAN) extension in the server certificate.&nbsp; If any of the configured<br>&nbsp;  names match any of the names in the SAN extension then the name check<br>&nbsp;  passes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It would be "more secure" in a specific technical sense if the<br>implementation could tie the configured acceptable name to the specific<br>CA (or CAs) that should have issued it, but I don't think current<br>implementations make this easy, and I also don't expect it to make a<br>practical difference in most real-world scenarios.&nbsp; So the most I would<br>suggest would be to mention the possibility in the security<br>considerations section, and I'm not even sure that it's worth doing<br>that.<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  which provides a public API for the exporter.&nbsp; Note that EAP-TLS with<br>&nbsp;  TLS 1.2 [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] can be used with the TLS exporter since the public<br>&nbsp;  exporter was defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc5705/">RFC5705</a>].<br><br>Is the intent to say that the TLS exporter-based formulae above will<br>produce the same result as (and thus, interoperate with) the PRF-based<br>formulae from <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a>?&nbsp; I did not thoroughly check the equivalence, but<br>a quick check suggests that it exists.&nbsp; If that is indeed the intent, I<br>would strongly suggest rephrasing to explicitly indicate the achieved<br>compatibility.<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  is not useful and not expected in EAP-TLS.&nbsp; After sending TLS<br>&nbsp;  Finished, the EAP-TLS server may send any number of post-handshake<br>&nbsp;  messages in separate EAP-Requests.<br><br>I don't think there's a fundamental requirement that each post-handshake<br>message goes in a separate EAP-Request, as this text seems to imply.<br>For example, a TLS stack that produces two NewSessionTicket messages<br>after the handshake completes would release them at the same time, and<br>(size permitting) EAP could easily carry them in a single EAP-Request.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>We might incorporate the security considerations of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> by<br>reference, though it's probably not critical to do so.<br><br>&nbsp;  [3] Cryptographic strength: TLS 1.3 only defines strong algorithms<br>&nbsp;  without major weaknesses and EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 always provides<br>&nbsp;  forward secrecy, see [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].&nbsp; Weak algorithms such as 3DES, CBC<br>&nbsp;  mode, RC4, SHA-1, MD5, P-192, and RSA-1024 cannot be negotiated.<br><br>I don't see anything in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> to support the claim that 3DES cannot<br>be negotiated -- ciphers at the 112-bit strength level are permitted,<br>see D.5.&nbsp; (But I also think I said this last time I balloted, so maybe I<br>just forgot what the response to my comment was...)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>The corresponding section of <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> does not reference <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC 6125</a> (which<br>is not surprising, given that it didn't exist at the time).&nbsp; While I<br>don't see a strong need to provide an extensive analysis of how the <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC<br>6125</a> procedures relate to EAP usage, it does seem that <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC 6125</a> provides<br>some useful information for performing server certificate validation,<br>and that a brief reference might be appropriate.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable revocation checking in situations where EAP-TLS peers do<br>&nbsp;  not implement or use OCSP stapling, and where network connectivity is<br>&nbsp;  not available prior to authentication completion, EAP-TLS peer<br>&nbsp;  implementations MUST also support checking for certificate revocation<br>&nbsp;  after authentication completes and network connectivity is available.<br><br>I just want to confirm that both "peer[s]"s are intended to be "peer"s,<br>here.&nbsp; I think it still makes sense this way, but "in cases where X do<br>not implement or use Y ... X implementations MUST also" is not a common<br>construction with both "X"es the same, so I wanted to check.<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>], where the EAP-TLS server avoids storing information<br>&nbsp;  locally and instead encapsulates the information into a ticket or PSK<br>&nbsp;  which is sent to the client for storage.&nbsp; This ticket or PSK is<br>&nbsp;  encrypted using a key that only the EAP-TLS server knows.&nbsp; Note that<br><br>I put this into my github PR, but just to note here: I don't think that<br>the "or PSK" is accurate in this scenario.<br><br>&nbsp;  If any authorization, accounting, or policy decisions were made with<br>&nbsp;  information that has changed between the initial full handshake and<br>&nbsp;  resumption, and if change may lead to a different decision, such<br>&nbsp;  decisions MUST be reevaluated.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that authorization,<br>&nbsp;  accounting, and policy decisions are reevaluated based on the<br>&nbsp;  information given in the resumption.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Up in §2.2 we say that "unauthenticated information MUST NOT be used<br>for [...] authorization".&nbsp; I'm not sure what scenarios you have in mind<br>where there is authenticated information that is changing between the<br>initial full handshake and the resumption -- when resumption succeeds,<br>won't basically all the authenticated information be from the original<br>full handshake?<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  static RSA based cipher suites without privacy.&nbsp; This implies that an<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS peer SHOULD NOT continue the handshake if a TLS 1.2 EAP-TLS<br>&nbsp;  server sends an EAP-TLS/Request with a TLS alert message in response<br>&nbsp;  to an empty certificate message from the peer.<br><br>Is it really "continue the [TLS] handshake" or "continue the [EAP]<br>authentication attempt"?&nbsp; My understanding was that the vulnerability<br>occurs when the peer initiates a new TLS handshake without attempting to<br>use privacy, which would otherwise be the behavior in response to the<br>described alert.<br><br>Section 5.10<br><br>&nbsp;  summarizes the attacks that were known at the time of publishing and<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a>] provides recommendations for improving the security<br><br>I'm not sure what the best XML syntax is for this, but <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> also<br>includes <a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a>, now (which we do cite, separately, at the end of this<br>paragraph).<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a> could probably be classified as informative -- while we do say<br>that what we specify is compliant to it, the reader does not need to<br>read 8126 and validate that claim.<br><br>Why is <a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a> normative but <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC 7525</a> (the other half of <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a>) only<br>informative?<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>I agree with the other reviewer that noted the different section<br>numbering between the old and new references; some acknowledgment of the<br>need to check section numbers seems in order.</div></td>

 This section updates Section 2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] by amending it with the<br>&nbsp;  following text.<br>&nbsp;  [...]<br>&nbsp;  TLS 1.3 changes both the message flow and the handshake messages<br>&nbsp;  compared to earlier versions of TLS.&nbsp; Therefore, much of Section 2.1<br>&nbsp;  of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] does not apply for TLS 1.3.&nbsp; Except for Sections 2.2 and<br>&nbsp;  5.7 this document applies only when TLS 1.3 is negotiated.&nbsp; When TLS<br>&nbsp;  1.2 is negotiated, then [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] applies.<br><br>There is perhaps some philosophical question of what "this document"<br>means in the context of an updated collection of text that includes <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC<br>5216</a> and the text that is being amended as directed here.&nbsp; I hope that<br>the RFC Editor will have some thoughts on this matter, but perhaps<br>s/this document/[RFCXXXX]/ would reduce ambiguity.&nbsp; If this change is<br>made, there would be similar/corresponding changes later on as well,<br>e.g., whenever the amended text includes a section reference to this<br>document, it would be "Section 2.1.3 of [RFCXXXX]".<br><br>Also, I think that both Sections 5.6 and 5.7 (not just 5.7) are marked<br>as applying to EAP-TLS in general.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Early Data MUST NOT be used in EAP-TLS.&nbsp; EAP-TLS servers MUST NOT<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; send an early_data extension and clients MUST NOT send an<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; EndOfEarlyData message.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn't include the last sentence, as both requirements<br>follow naturally from the previous requirement.&nbsp; It feels a little<br>surprising to make reference to the specific message-level requirements<br>on the TLS stack, though I won't object to keeping this text if the<br>authors/WG find it important.<br><br>&nbsp;  *&nbsp; Servers MUST NOT request post-handshake client authentication.<br><br>Do we want to make any statement about the client (not) sending the<br>"post_handshake_auth" extension (which the client must do as a<br>prerequisite of the server requesting post-handshake client<br>authentication)?<br><br>Section 2.1.1<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  After the EAP-TLS server<br>&nbsp;  has sent an EAP-Request containing the TLS application data 0x00 and<br>&nbsp;  received an EAP-Response packet of EAP-Type=EAP-TLS and no data, the<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS server sends EAP-Success.<br><br>I think in some sense the EAP-Server also needs to not have additional<br>TLS data do send in order to declare success and send EAP-Success.<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;  full handshake.&nbsp; In the case a full handshake is required, the<br>&nbsp;  negotiation proceeds as if the session was a new authentication, and<br>&nbsp;  resumption had never been requested.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I put a suggested alternative phrasing in my editorial PR, but wanted to<br>note the reasoning for the change in my ballot comment here.<br>"Had never been requested" is perhaps problematic in that the request<br>for resumption is encoded in the ClientHello, and to say that it had<br>never happened seems a little like suggesting that the ClientHello is<br>modified (which is not what happens).<br><br>&nbsp;  Figure 3 shows an example message flow for a subsequent successful<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS resumption handshake where both sides authenticate via a PSK<br>&nbsp;  provisioned via an earlier NewSessionTicket and where the server<br>&nbsp;  provisions a single new ticket.<br><br>I would suggest indicating that the TLS ClientHello includes the<br>"pre_shared_key" extension to help differentiate the resumption<br>handshake from the full handshake depicted in Figures 1/2.<br><br>&nbsp;  When using "psk_dhe_ke", TLS 1.3 provides forward secrecy meaning<br>&nbsp;  that key leakage does not compromise any earlier connections.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It's probably worth saying which key is leaked to trigger the "key<br>leakage" scenario being described.<br><br>Section 2.1.8<br><br>I might consider noting that the "hello_request" message doesn't exist<br>in TLS 1.3, so the <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> procedures are inherently inapplicable with<br>TLS 1.3.&nbsp; On the other hand, that might be covered by the blanket<br>statement in §2.1, and thus unneeded here.<br><br>Section 2.2<br><br>&nbsp;  The EAP peer identity provided in the EAP-Response/Identity is not<br>&nbsp;  authenticated by EAP-TLS.&nbsp; Unauthenticated information MUST NOT be<br>&nbsp;  used for accounting purposes or to give authorization.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>There's some analogous text in 5216 that talks about use for "accounting<br>purposes" or "access control" (at the SHOULD NOT level) -- is there a<br>reason to use/not use the same phrasing that 5216 did?<br><br>&nbsp;  (SAN) extension in the server certificate.&nbsp; If any of the configured<br>&nbsp;  names match any of the names in the SAN extension then the name check<br>&nbsp;  passes.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>It would be "more secure" in a specific technical sense if the<br>implementation could tie the configured acceptable name to the specific<br>CA (or CAs) that should have issued it, but I don't think current<br>implementations make this easy, and I also don't expect it to make a<br>practical difference in most real-world scenarios.&nbsp; So the most I would<br>suggest would be to mention the possibility in the security<br>considerations section, and I'm not even sure that it's worth doing<br>that.<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>&nbsp;  which provides a public API for the exporter.&nbsp; Note that EAP-TLS with<br>&nbsp;  TLS 1.2 [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] can be used with the TLS exporter since the public<br>&nbsp;  exporter was defined in [<a href="/doc/rfc5705/">RFC5705</a>].<br><br>Is the intent to say that the TLS exporter-based formulae above will<br>produce the same result as (and thus, interoperate with) the PRF-based<br>formulae from <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a>?&nbsp; I did not thoroughly check the equivalence, but<br>a quick check suggests that it exists.&nbsp; If that is indeed the intent, I<br>would strongly suggest rephrasing to explicitly indicate the achieved<br>compatibility.<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>&nbsp;  is not useful and not expected in EAP-TLS.&nbsp; After sending TLS<br>&nbsp;  Finished, the EAP-TLS server may send any number of post-handshake<br>&nbsp;  messages in separate EAP-Requests.<br><br>I don't think there's a fundamental requirement that each post-handshake<br>message goes in a separate EAP-Request, as this text seems to imply.<br>For example, a TLS stack that produces two NewSessionTicket messages<br>after the handshake completes would release them at the same time, and<br>(size permitting) EAP could easily carry them in a single EAP-Request.<br><br>Section 5.1<br><br>We might incorporate the security considerations of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> by<br>reference, though it's probably not critical to do so.<br><br>&nbsp;  [3] Cryptographic strength: TLS 1.3 only defines strong algorithms<br>&nbsp;  without major weaknesses and EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 always provides<br>&nbsp;  forward secrecy, see [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].&nbsp; Weak algorithms such as 3DES, CBC<br>&nbsp;  mode, RC4, SHA-1, MD5, P-192, and RSA-1024 cannot be negotiated.<br><br>I don't see anything in <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> to support the claim that 3DES cannot<br>be negotiated -- ciphers at the 112-bit strength level are permitted,<br>see D.5.&nbsp; (But I also think I said this last time I balloted, so maybe I<br>just forgot what the response to my comment was...)<br><br>Section 5.3<br><br>The corresponding section of <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a> does not reference <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC 6125</a> (which<br>is not surprising, given that it didn't exist at the time).&nbsp; While I<br>don't see a strong need to provide an extensive analysis of how the <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC<br>6125</a> procedures relate to EAP usage, it does seem that <a href="/doc/rfc6125/">RFC 6125</a> provides<br>some useful information for performing server certificate validation,<br>and that a brief reference might be appropriate.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable revocation checking in situations where EAP-TLS peers do<br>&nbsp;  not implement or use OCSP stapling, and where network connectivity is<br>&nbsp;  not available prior to authentication completion, EAP-TLS peer<br>&nbsp;  implementations MUST also support checking for certificate revocation<br>&nbsp;  after authentication completes and network connectivity is available.<br><br>I just want to confirm that both "peer[s]"s are intended to be "peer"s,<br>here.&nbsp; I think it still makes sense this way, but "in cases where X do<br>not implement or use Y ... X implementations MUST also" is not a common<br>construction with both "X"es the same, so I wanted to check.<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>], where the EAP-TLS server avoids storing information<br>&nbsp;  locally and instead encapsulates the information into a ticket or PSK<br>&nbsp;  which is sent to the client for storage.&nbsp; This ticket or PSK is<br>&nbsp;  encrypted using a key that only the EAP-TLS server knows.&nbsp; Note that<br><br>I put this into my github PR, but just to note here: I don't think that<br>the "or PSK" is accurate in this scenario.<br><br>&nbsp;  If any authorization, accounting, or policy decisions were made with<br>&nbsp;  information that has changed between the initial full handshake and<br>&nbsp;  resumption, and if change may lead to a different decision, such<br>&nbsp;  decisions MUST be reevaluated.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that authorization,<br>&nbsp;  accounting, and policy decisions are reevaluated based on the<br>&nbsp;  information given in the resumption.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>Up in §2.2 we say that "unauthenticated information MUST NOT be used<br>for [...] authorization".&nbsp; I'm not sure what scenarios you have in mind<br>where there is authenticated information that is changing between the<br>initial full handshake and the resumption -- when resumption succeeds,<br>won't basically all the authenticated information be from the original<br>full handshake?<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  static RSA based cipher suites without privacy.&nbsp; This implies that an<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS peer SHOULD NOT continue the handshake if a TLS 1.2 EAP-TLS<br>&nbsp;  server sends an EAP-TLS/Request with a TLS alert message in response<br>&nbsp;  to an empty certificate message from the peer.<br><br>Is it really "continue the [TLS] handshake" or "continue the [EAP]<br>authentication attempt"?&nbsp; My understanding was that the vulnerability<br>occurs when the peer initiates a new TLS handshake without attempting to<br>use privacy, which would otherwise be the behavior in response to the<br>described alert.<br><br>Section 5.10<br><br>&nbsp;  summarizes the attacks that were known at the time of publishing and<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC7525</a>] provides recommendations for improving the security<br><br>I'm not sure what the best XML syntax is for this, but <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a> also<br>includes <a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a>, now (which we do cite, separately, at the end of this<br>paragraph).<br><br>Section 6.1<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a> could probably be classified as informative -- while we do say<br>that what we specify is compliant to it, the reader does not need to<br>read 8126 and validate that claim.<br><br>Why is <a href="/doc/rfc8996/">RFC 8996</a> normative but <a href="/doc/rfc7525/">RFC 7525</a> (the other half of <a href="/doc/bcp195/">BCP 195</a>) only<br>informative?<br><br>Appendix A<br><br>I agree with the other reviewer that noted the different section<br>numbering between the old and new references; some acknowledgment of the<br>need to check section numbers seems in order.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Proposed Standard because it is specify a revision to a protocol that is on standards track that is widely implemented. <br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This document specifies the use of EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 while<br>&nbsp;  remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of EAP-<br>&nbsp;  TLS.&nbsp; TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security, privacy, and<br>&nbsp;  reduced latency when compared to earlier versions of TLS.&nbsp; EAP-TLS<br>&nbsp;  with TLS 1.3 further improves security and privacy by mandating use<br>&nbsp;  of privacy and revocation checking.&nbsp; This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a>.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The document had a lot of review and discussion.&nbsp; There is in general <br>good consensus for moving the document forward. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Much of the discussion on the list was based on comments from implemented<br> of the previous version of the protocol or the proposed version of the protocol. <br>At least two public implementations of the protocol are available:<br>wpa_supplicant - <a href="https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/">https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/</a> <br>free radius - <a href="https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server">https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server</a><br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd - Joe Salowey<br>Responsible AD - Roman Danyliw<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>The document shepherd has reviewed the document and believes it is ready for publication. <br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>No<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>No concerns. <br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are references to obsoleted documents that are intentional to discuss changes in behavior of the protocol. <br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>NA<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes <br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>This document will update <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a>.&nbsp; This is included in the header, abstract and introduction.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>IANA section is complete<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>No New registries<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br>NA <br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation?

That is, if the server is forbidden from generating a<br>NewSessionTicket message that includes the "early_data" extension, then<br>the client is also forbidden from sending "early_data" in a ClientHello.<br>[ed. we do do this in §2.1.2]<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;

 A subsequent authentication using resumption, where both sides<br>&nbsp;  authenticate successfully (without the issuance of more resumption<br>&nbsp;  tickets) is shown in Figure 3.<br><br>(It's slightly surprising to show an example of resumption without<br>issuing additional resumption tickets, since such issuance is basically<br>necessary in order to comply with the recommendation from earlier in the<br>section to follow the client tracking prevention mechanisms in Appendix<br>C.4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>.&nbsp;

If the EAP-TLS peer did not supply a<br>&nbsp;  "key_share" extension when attempting resumption, the EAP-TLS server<br>&nbsp;  needs to reject the ClientHello and the EAP-TLS peer needs to restart<br>&nbsp;  a full handshake.&nbsp; The message flow in this case is given by Figure 4<br>&nbsp;  followed by Figure 1.<br><br>&nbsp;  Also during resumption, the EAP-TLS server can respond with a Hello<br>&nbsp;  Retry Request (see Section 2.1.6) or issue a new ticket (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 2.1.2)<br><br>I don't understand why the "alert plus fresh handshake" flow is even<br>listed as an option -- AFAICT the HelloRetryRequest (note: no spaces)<br>flow is uniformly superior.&nbsp; There is no benefit in round-trip count to<br>starting a fresh handshake, and HelloRetryRequest allows the initial<br>interaction to be authenticated by the continued handshake transcript.<br>Aborting and starting over is analogous to the dreaded "downgrade dance"<br>that has periodically plagued the TLS ecosystem, and I'm confused that<br>we would consider encouraging it to return.&nbsp; I would instead say that<br>the server "needs to send HelloRetryRequest to signal that additional<br>information is needed to complete the handshake, and the EAP-TLS peer<br>needs to send a second ClientHello containing that information" (or<br>similar), and drop the "Figure 4 followed by Figure 1" sentence.&nbsp; (The<br>final paragraph would then become a bit redundant, but perhaps there is<br>still some information that should be persisted.)<br><br>Section 2.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The two paragraphs below replaces the corresponding paragraphs in<br>&nbsp;  Section 2.1.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] when EAP-TLS is used with TLS 1.3 or<br>&nbsp;  higher.&nbsp; The other paragraphs in Section 2.1.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] still<br>&nbsp;

If the EAP-TLS server authenticates successfully, the EAP-TLS peer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST send an EAP-Response message with EAP-Type=EAP-TLS containing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS records conforming to the version of TLS used.<br><br>Just to walk through the various scenarios here; if the last message of<br>the TLS handshake for a given TLS version is sent by the TLS client, that<br>will go in an EAP-Response, so the server is then able to send<br>EAP-Success directly.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the last TLS handshake<br>message is sent by the server, that will have to go in an EAP-TLS<br>EAP-Request, and so the peer will have to send an empty EAP-TLS response<br>in order for the server to be able to wend EAP-Success?&nbsp; Do we need to<br>have any text here to handle that empty EAP-TLS Eap-Request case?<br><br>&nbsp;  In the case where the EAP-TLS server rejects the ClientHello with a<br>&nbsp;  fatal error, the conversation will appear as shown in Figure 4.&nbsp;

TLS 1.3<br><br>Where does <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> forbid 3DES?&nbsp; CBC is forbidden by the requirement to<br>be AEAD, and RC4 and MD5 are explicitly forbidden, but the situation for<br>SHA-1 is more subtle.&nbsp; Please reword this sentence to be accurate.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  When EAP-TLS is used with TLS 1.3, the revocation status of all the<br>&nbsp;  certificates in the certificate chains MUST be checked.<br><br>What does this mandatory checking entail when a certificate contains<br>neither a CRL Distribution Point nor an OCSP responder URL?&nbsp; (See also<br>the recent thread on the LAMPS WG list with Subject: "The<br>id-ce-noRevAvail extension".)<br><br>&nbsp;  TLS, see Section 4.4.2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].&nbsp; In TLS 1.3 the OCSP<br>&nbsp;  information is carried in the CertificateEntry containing the<br>&nbsp;  associated certificate instead of a separate CertificateStatus<br>&nbsp;  message as in [<a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC4366</a>].&nbsp; This enables sending OCSP information for<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC 4366</a> seems like a stale (obsolete) reference, and <a href="/doc/rfc6066/">RFC 6066</a> should be<br>preferred.&nbsp; (<a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC 4366</a> would then become an unused reference, I believe.)<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable revocation checking in situations where EAP-TLS peers do<br>&nbsp;  not implement or use OCSP stapling, and where network connectivity is<br>&nbsp;  not available prior to authentication completion, EAP--TLS peer<br>&nbsp;  implementations MUST also support checking for certificate revocation<br>&nbsp;  after authentication completes and network connectivity is available,<br>&nbsp;  and they SHOULD utilize this capability by default.<br><br>If it's RECOMMENDED to use OCSP stapling, what does it mean that they<br>"SHOULD utilize this capability by default" (as well)?<br><br>(Also, nit: only one '-' in EAP-TLS.)<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>It seems like there may be some scope for improvements on the <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a><br>behavior here.&nbsp; For example, what if we used the EAP Type field as the<br>TLS Exporter 'context' argument, instead of the literal 0x0D?&nbsp; That<br>seems like it would prevent the modification from successfully causing a<br>different TLS-based EAP method to be used, by using a different<br>key-derivation formula, exactly as postulated by <a href="/doc/rfc5126/">RFC 5126</a>.<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;

 If any authorization, accounting, or policy decisions were made with<br>&nbsp;  information that have changed between the initial full handshake and<br>&nbsp;  resumption, and if change may lead to a different decision, such<br>&nbsp;  decisions MUST be reevaluated.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that authorization,<br>&nbsp;  accounting, and policy decisions are reevaluated based on the<br>&nbsp;  information given in the resumption.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand how these two sentences fit together.&nbsp; Is it<br>trying to say that "if there could be a different decision, you<br>definitly have to re-check, and we recommend just always re-checking<br>since that's timpler"?<br><br>&nbsp;  Where a good decision is unclear, EAP-TLS servers SHOULD reject the<br>&nbsp;  resumption.<br><br>I suggest "reject the assumption and continue with a full handshake".<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 4.2.11, 8.1, and 8.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>] provides security<br>&nbsp;  considerations for resumption.<br><br>I'm curious why specifically § 8.1 and 8.2 were selected, given that §8<br>as a whole is about "0-RTT and Anti-Replay", which is a more specific<br>topic than just resumption.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  Tracking of users by eavesdropping on identity responses or<br>&nbsp;  certificates is a well-known problem in many EAP methods.&nbsp; When EAP-<br>&nbsp;  TLS is used with TLS 1.3, all certificates are encrypted, and the<br>&nbsp;  username part of the identity response is always confidentiality<br>&nbsp;  protected (e.g. using anonymous NAIs).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As written this applies to server certificates as well as TLS client<br>certificates.&nbsp; For which the statement is technically true, but with the<br>caveat that it is typically easy to persuade the server to (re-)send<br>those same certificates encrypted to a key known to the attacker, so the<br>protection provided by the encryption is limited.&nbsp; (The server has been<br>fairly strongly authenticated by the time the EAP peer makes the<br>decision to send its certificate, so there the reverse situation is<br>different.)<br><br>&nbsp;  and only using the pseudo-random usernames a single time.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp;  the privacy-friendly usernames also MUST NOT include substrings that<br>&nbsp;  can be used to relate the identity to a specific user.&nbsp; Similarly,<br>&nbsp;  privacy-friendly username SHOULD NOT be formed by a fixed mapping<br>&nbsp;  that stays the same across multiple different authentications.<br><br>I think that violating the SHOULD NOT would intrinsically violate the<br>preceding MUST NOT ... so should they both be MUST NOTs?<br><br>&nbsp;  static RSA based cipher suites without privacy.&nbsp; This implies that an<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS peer SHOULD NOT continue the handshake if a TLS 1.2 EAP-TLS<br>&nbsp;  server responds to an empty certificate message with a TLS alert<br>&nbsp;  message.<br><br>Just to check my understanding, this "response" would be an EAP-TLS<br>response containing a new ClientHello (that would proceed to do a<br>handshake including the client certificate in the unprotected initial<br>handshake)?&nbsp; That is, it would be a response at the EAP layer but not at<br>the TLS layer.<br><br>Section 5.9<br><br>&nbsp;  Pervasive monitoring refers to widespread surveillance of users.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  the context EAP-TLS, pervasive monitoring attacks can target EAP-TLS<br><br>nit: "context of"<br><br>Section 5.10<br><br>&nbsp;

I will also invite the TLS WG to provide input<br>on these issues, since they relate to rather fundamental issues of the<br>operation of the TLS sub-protocols.<br><br>Most of them concern the Commitment Message, in terms of what goals it<br>aims to achieve, how it is specified, and what mechanism is used to<br>effectuate it.<br><br>To start with the easy one: currently the way in which the structure of<br>the Commitment Message is described makes reference to many fields of<br>TLS Record Layer structures in order to specify what is fundamentally a<br>message on the TLS Application Data stream.&nbsp; This is a layering<br>violation; I don't see any reason to say more than what was suggested in<br><a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/emu/ECgvnq-C_VVXT5bpvOowte8LBjw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/emu/ECgvnq-C_VVXT5bpvOowte8LBjw/</a> :<br>"the commit[ment] message is a single byte of [value] 0 in the application data<br>stream".&nbsp; All the bits about cryptographic protection and expansion of the<br>plaintext in prepararation for record protection are just adding noise,<br>and the interface between the TLS stack and the application is supposed<br>to be a data-stream abstraction, not a record abstraction.<br><br>Next, the whole reason for the existence of a Commitment Message seems<br>under-justified -- the only mention I could find in the document is that<br>it serves "to decrease the uncertainty for the EAP-TLS peer".&nbsp; What harm<br>would be caused by a lack of certainty in this area?&nbsp; Why does waiting<br>for an EAP-Success or EAP-Failure not provide a similar level of<br>certainty?<br><br>The document also suggests in several places that the Commitment Message<br>can or should be sent at 0.5-RTT data in the same flight as the server<br>Finished.&nbsp; The intent, as determined from the mailing list archive,<br>seems to be to save a round-trip compared to a typical full message flow<br>where the server does not send application data until after the client's<br>Finished (and any application data alongside it) is received.&nbsp; In<br>particular, this came out during discussion of how a TLS "close_notify"<br>alert would be unsuitable for the role of the Commitment Message, since<br>sending the "close_notify" in 0.5-RTT would prevent sending an alert if<br>the client authentication failed, and the diagnostic value of such<br>alerts is significant.&nbsp; This is where the issues start to become<br>interrelated -- the Commitment Message as a new application-data<br>construct is for the objective of reducing the number of round trips.<br>However, TLS session resumption is also designed to reduce the number of<br>round-trips (including by no longer needing to send potentially large<br>TLS Certificate messages that get fragmented at the EAP layer, with the<br>cost of a round trip per fragment), and there is a nasty interaction<br>between the two mechanisms.&nbsp; Specifically, TLS 1.3 session resumption<br>requires the use of a NewSessionTicket message, which is associated with<br>a resumption secret; the resumption secret, in turn, is not available in<br>the key schedule until the client Finished (and client authentication<br>messages, if any) is available.&nbsp; While it is possible in many Web<br>scenarios for NewSessionTicket to be issued in the 0.5-RTT flight, this<br>is because the server can precompute what the valid client Finished<br>would be and use that in the key schedule to precompute the resumption<br>secret.&nbsp; If the client is to be authenticated, as is the case for the<br>vast majority of EAP exchanges, then such precomputation is impossible,<br>and the session ticket cannot be issued until the extra round trip is<br>completed.&nbsp; The document contains no discussion of the inherent tradeoff<br>between sending the commitment message in 0.5-RTT and using resumption,<br>and this tradeoff seems to call into question the merits of choosing<br>this mechanism to implement the commitment message, since...<br><br>The commitment message as specified seems to itself be a layering<br>violation.&nbsp; The TLS protocol itself consists of a few sub-protocols,<br>e.g., the handshake protocol, record protocol, and alert protocol.&nbsp; The<br>operation of the handshake protocol is supposed to be completely<br>independent of the application-data record protocol (except to the<br>extent that the handshake protocol supplies the keys used for<br>cryptographic protection of application data records).&nbsp; In particular,<br>there should not be any interaction between the handshake state machine<br>and the application data.&nbsp; If there is to be a commitment made about the<br>operation of the TLS handshake protocol, that more properly belongs in<br>the handshake layer itself, or perhaps the alert layer if it relates to<br>the overall operation of the TLS connection.&nbsp; It seems inappropriate and<br>unsustainable to expect that an application-data message would affect<br>the operation of the handshake layer.<br><br>The use of application data for the commitment message also may have<br>unfortunate interactions with other TLS-using EAP methods, which is very<br>briefly mentioned as a possibility but not explored at all:<br><br>&nbsp;  While EAP-TLS does not protect any application data except for the<br>&nbsp;  Commitment Message, the negotiated cipher suites and algorithms MAY<br>&nbsp;  be used to secure data as done in other TLS-based EAP methods.<br><br>If we are to expect this construction of commitment message to become<br>the de facto standard for using TLS 1.3 with EAP, I think we need to<br>consider whether other EAP methods that do need to actually protect<br>application data with the TLS connection will be affected by this<br>proposal to insert the EAP commitment message into the application data<br>stream.&nbsp; This is worth particular consideration given that we require<br>that "EAP-TLS peer implementations MUST accept any application data as a<br>Commitment Message from the EAP-TLS server to not send any more<br>handshake messages" -- these seem like new semantics that might be quite<br>unexpected if applied to other EAP methods.<br><br>There's also a few internal inconsistencies that raise to a<br>discuss-level and will need to be resolved before publication:<br><br>The body text around Figure 3 indicates that mutual authentication<br>should be depicted, but the figure shows only normal server-only<br>authentication.<br><br>The example in Figure 8 needs a TLS CertificateRequest in there in order<br>for the rest of the flow to make sense.<br><br>Section 2.1.4 says that "TLS warning alerts generally mean that the<br>connection can continue normally and does not change the message flow."<br>but this is no longer true with TLS 1.3 -- the only alerts sent at<br>warning level are "close_notify" and "user_cancelled", both of which<br>indicate that the connection is not going to continue normally.<br><br>Section 2.1.9 claims that the largest size of a TLS record is 16387<br>octets, but by my count a TLSCiphertext can get up to 16643, since the<br>length field "MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 256 bytes" (and there's the other 3<br>bytes of header).<br><br>Please also check the statements made about <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> that I note in my<br>comments on Section 5.1.</div></td>

 used in EAP-TLS.&nbsp; A EAP-TLS server which receives an "early_data"<br>&nbsp;  extension MUST ignore the extension or respond with a<br>&nbsp;  HelloRetryRequest as described in Section 4.2.10 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].<br><br>It's probably better to place restrictions on the indication that early<br>data might be possible, than to (just) place restrictions on accepting<br>it.&nbsp; That is, if the server is forbidden from generating a<br>NewSessionTicket message that includes the "early_data" extension, then<br>the client is also forbidden from sending "early_data" in a ClientHello.<br>[ed. we do do this in §2.1.2]<br><br>Section 2.1.3<br><br>&nbsp;

However, the EAP-TLS<br><br>But the EAP-TLS server sets how long the ticket is valid :)<br>Should we give some guidance on how long that should be (noting that it<br>must say within the <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>-mandated 7 day maximum).<br><br>&nbsp;

 A subsequent authentication using resumption, where both sides<br>&nbsp;  authenticate successfully (without the issuance of more resumption<br>&nbsp;  tickets) is shown in Figure 3.<br><br>(It's slightly surprising to show an example of resumption without<br>issuing additional resumption tickets, since such issuance is basically<br>necessary in order to comply with the recommendation from earlier in the<br>section to follow the client tracking prevention mechanisms in Appendix<br>C.4 of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a>.&nbsp; Though I guess <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-tls-ticketrequests/">draft-ietf-tls-ticketrequests</a> is<br>potentially relevant for just how necessary it is going to be in<br>practice.)<br><br>&nbsp;  back to a full handshake.&nbsp; If the EAP-TLS peer did not supply a<br>&nbsp;  "key_share" extension when attempting resumption, the EAP-TLS server<br>&nbsp;  needs to reject the ClientHello and the EAP-TLS peer needs to restart<br>&nbsp;  a full handshake.&nbsp; The message flow in this case is given by Figure 4<br>&nbsp;  followed by Figure 1.<br><br>&nbsp;  Also during resumption, the EAP-TLS server can respond with a Hello<br>&nbsp;  Retry Request (see Section 2.1.6) or issue a new ticket (see<br>&nbsp;  Section 2.1.2)<br><br>I don't understand why the "alert plus fresh handshake" flow is even<br>listed as an option -- AFAICT the HelloRetryRequest (note: no spaces)<br>flow is uniformly superior.&nbsp; There is no benefit in round-trip count to<br>starting a fresh handshake, and HelloRetryRequest allows the initial<br>interaction to be authenticated by the continued handshake transcript.<br>Aborting and starting over is analogous to the dreaded "downgrade dance"<br>that has periodically plagued the TLS ecosystem, and I'm confused that<br>we would consider encouraging it to return.&nbsp; I would instead say that<br>the server "needs to send HelloRetryRequest to signal that additional<br>information is needed to complete the handshake, and the EAP-TLS peer<br>needs to send a second ClientHello containing that information" (or<br>similar), and drop the "Figure 4 followed by Figure 1" sentence.&nbsp; (The<br>final paragraph would then become a bit redundant, but perhaps there is<br>still some information that should be persisted.)<br><br>Section 2.1.4<br><br>&nbsp;  The two paragraphs below replaces the corresponding paragraphs in<br>&nbsp;  Section 2.1.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] when EAP-TLS is used with TLS 1.3 or<br>&nbsp;  higher.&nbsp; The other paragraphs in Section 2.1.3 of [<a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC5216</a>] still<br>&nbsp;  apply with the exception that SessionID is deprecated.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the EAP-TLS peer authenticates successfully, the EAP-TLS server<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST send an EAP-Request packet with EAP-Type=EAP-TLS containing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS records conforming to the version of TLS used.&nbsp; The message<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flow ends with the EAP-TLS server sending an EAP-Success message.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the EAP-TLS server authenticates successfully, the EAP-TLS peer<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MUST send an EAP-Response message with EAP-Type=EAP-TLS containing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TLS records conforming to the version of TLS used.<br><br>Just to walk through the various scenarios here; if the last message of<br>the TLS handshake for a given TLS version is sent by the TLS client, that<br>will go in an EAP-Response, so the server is then able to send<br>EAP-Success directly.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the last TLS handshake<br>message is sent by the server, that will have to go in an EAP-TLS<br>EAP-Request, and so the peer will have to send an empty EAP-TLS response<br>in order for the server to be able to wend EAP-Success?&nbsp; Do we need to<br>have any text here to handle that empty EAP-TLS Eap-Request case?<br><br>&nbsp;  In the case where the EAP-TLS server rejects the ClientHello with a<br>&nbsp;  fatal error, the conversation will appear as shown in Figure 4.&nbsp; The<br><br>Should we perhaps say that these examples are with TLS 1.3, even if the<br>actual normative protocol is no longer tied to a specific TLS version?<br><br>Section 2.1.5<br><br>In some sense, this figure depicting the no-peer-authentication case is<br>just an example specific to TLS 1.3 and is not necessarily<br>representative of the generic EAP-TLS case for potential future versions<br>of TLS.&nbsp; Should we make that more clear from the prose?<br><br>Section 2.1.6<br><br>&nbsp;  the handshake.&nbsp; One use case is if the EAP-TLS server does not<br>&nbsp;  support the groups in the "key_share" extension, but supports one of<br><br>I'd consider adding a parenthetical "(or there is no "key_share"<br>extension)".<br><br>Section 2.1.8<br><br>&nbsp;  username in cleartext in the Identity Response.&nbsp; Following [<a href="/doc/rfc7542/">RFC7542</a>],<br>&nbsp;  it is RECOMMENDED to omit the username (i.e. the NAI is @realm), but<br>&nbsp;  other constructions such as a fixed username (e.g. anonymous@realm)<br>&nbsp;  or an encrypted username (e.g.&nbsp; YmVuZGVy@realm) are allowed.&nbsp; Note<br><br>(I note that YmVuZGVy is just base64("bender"); does that really count<br>as "encrypted"?)<br><br>Section 2.3<br><br>The use of a constant 0x0D (the "Type-Code") as the TLS-Exporter context<br>is rather unusual;

 suites with confidentiality and encrypting certificates and some of<br>&nbsp;  the extensions, see [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].&nbsp; When using EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3, the<br><br>I note that there exist codepoints for TLS 1.3 ciphersuites that do not<br>provide confidentiality protection.&nbsp; Please point to the part of <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC<br>8446</a> that mandates this behavior.<br><br>&nbsp;  [3] Key strength: TLS 1.3 forbids all algorithms with known<br>&nbsp;  weaknesses including 3DES, CBC mode, RC4, SHA-1, and MD5.&nbsp; TLS 1.3<br><br>Where does <a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC 8446</a> forbid 3DES?&nbsp; CBC is forbidden by the requirement to<br>be AEAD, and RC4 and MD5 are explicitly forbidden, but the situation for<br>SHA-1 is more subtle.&nbsp; Please reword this sentence to be accurate.<br><br>Section 5.4<br><br>&nbsp;  When EAP-TLS is used with TLS 1.3, the revocation status of all the<br>&nbsp;  certificates in the certificate chains MUST be checked.<br><br>What does this mandatory checking entail when a certificate contains<br>neither a CRL Distribution Point nor an OCSP responder URL?&nbsp; (See also<br>the recent thread on the LAMPS WG list with Subject: "The<br>id-ce-noRevAvail extension".)<br><br>&nbsp;  TLS, see Section 4.4.2.1 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>].&nbsp; In TLS 1.3 the OCSP<br>&nbsp;  information is carried in the CertificateEntry containing the<br>&nbsp;  associated certificate instead of a separate CertificateStatus<br>&nbsp;  message as in [<a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC4366</a>].&nbsp; This enables sending OCSP information for<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC 4366</a> seems like a stale (obsolete) reference, and <a href="/doc/rfc6066/">RFC 6066</a> should be<br>preferred.&nbsp; (<a href="/doc/rfc4366/">RFC 4366</a> would then become an unused reference, I believe.)<br><br>&nbsp;  To enable revocation checking in situations where EAP-TLS peers do<br>&nbsp;  not implement or use OCSP stapling, and where network connectivity is<br>&nbsp;  not available prior to authentication completion, EAP--TLS peer<br>&nbsp;  implementations MUST also support checking for certificate revocation<br>&nbsp;  after authentication completes and network connectivity is available,<br>&nbsp;  and they SHOULD utilize this capability by default.<br><br>If it's RECOMMENDED to use OCSP stapling, what does it mean that they<br>"SHOULD utilize this capability by default" (as well)?<br><br>(Also, nit: only one '-' in EAP-TLS.)<br><br>Section 5.5<br><br>It seems like there may be some scope for improvements on the <a href="/doc/rfc5216/">RFC 5216</a><br>behavior here.&nbsp; For example, what if we used the EAP Type field as the<br>TLS Exporter 'context' argument, instead of the literal 0x0D?&nbsp; That<br>seems like it would prevent the modification from successfully causing a<br>different TLS-based EAP method to be used, by using a different<br>key-derivation formula, exactly as postulated by <a href="/doc/rfc5126/">RFC 5126</a>.<br><br>Section 5.7<br><br>&nbsp;  and the authorizations of the other party may have been reduced.&nbsp; If<br>&nbsp;  the cached revocation is not sufficiently current, the EAP-TLS peer<br>&nbsp;  or EAP-TLS server MAY force a full TLS handshake.<br><br>nit: s/cached revocation/cached revocation data/<br><br>&nbsp;  in the certificate chain has been revoked or has expired.&nbsp; In all<br>&nbsp;  such cases, resumption results in a full TLS handshake instead.<br><br>nit: s/resumption results/an attempt at resumption results/ (or similar)<br><br>&nbsp;  If any authorization, accounting, or policy decisions were made with<br>&nbsp;  information that have changed between the initial full handshake and<br>&nbsp;  resumption, and if change may lead to a different decision, such<br>&nbsp;  decisions MUST be reevaluated.&nbsp; It is RECOMMENDED that authorization,<br>&nbsp;  accounting, and policy decisions are reevaluated based on the<br>&nbsp;  information given in the resumption.&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I'm not sure I understand how these two sentences fit together.&nbsp; Is it<br>trying to say that "if there could be a different decision, you<br>definitly have to re-check, and we recommend just always re-checking<br>since that's timpler"?<br><br>&nbsp;  Where a good decision is unclear, EAP-TLS servers SHOULD reject the<br>&nbsp;  resumption.<br><br>I suggest "reject the assumption and continue with a full handshake".<br><br>&nbsp;  Section 4.2.11, 8.1, and 8.2 of [<a href="/doc/rfc8446/">RFC8446</a>] provides security<br>&nbsp;  considerations for resumption.<br><br>I'm curious why specifically § 8.1 and 8.2 were selected, given that §8<br>as a whole is about "0-RTT and Anti-Replay", which is a more specific<br>topic than just resumption.<br><br>Section 5.8<br><br>&nbsp;  Tracking of users by eavesdropping on identity responses or<br>&nbsp;  certificates is a well-known problem in many EAP methods.&nbsp; When EAP-<br>&nbsp;  TLS is used with TLS 1.3, all certificates are encrypted, and the<br>&nbsp;  username part of the identity response is always confidentiality<br>&nbsp;  protected (e.g. using anonymous NAIs).&nbsp; [...]<br><br>As written this applies to server certificates as well as TLS client<br>certificates.&nbsp; For which the statement is technically true, but with the<br>caveat that it is typically easy to persuade the server to (re-)send<br>those same certificates encrypted to a key known to the attacker, so the<br>protection provided by the encryption is limited.&nbsp; (The server has been<br>fairly strongly authenticated by the time the EAP peer makes the<br>decision to send its certificate, so there the reverse situation is<br>different.)<br><br>&nbsp;  and only using the pseudo-random usernames a single time.&nbsp; Note that<br>&nbsp;  the privacy-friendly usernames also MUST NOT include substrings that<br>&nbsp;  can be used to relate the identity to a specific user.&nbsp; Similarly,<br>&nbsp;  privacy-friendly username SHOULD NOT be formed by a fixed mapping<br>&nbsp;  that stays the same across multiple different authentications.<br><br>I think that violating the SHOULD NOT would intrinsically violate the<br>preceding MUST NOT ... so should they both be MUST NOTs?<br><br>&nbsp;  static RSA based cipher suites without privacy.&nbsp; This implies that an<br>&nbsp;  EAP-TLS peer SHOULD NOT continue the handshake if a TLS 1.2 EAP-TLS<br>&nbsp;  server responds to an empty certificate message with a TLS alert<br>&nbsp;  message.<br><br>Just to check my understanding, this "response" would be an EAP-TLS<br>response containing a new ClientHello (that would proceed to do a<br>handshake including the client certificate in the unprotected initial<br>handshake)?&nbsp; That is, it would be a response at the EAP layer but not at<br>the TLS layer.<br><br>Section 5.9<br><br>&nbsp;  Pervasive monitoring refers to widespread surveillance of users.&nbsp; In<br>&nbsp;  the context EAP-TLS, pervasive monitoring attacks can target EAP-TLS<br><br>nit: "context of"<br><br>Section 5.10<br><br>&nbsp;
