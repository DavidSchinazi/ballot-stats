The document<br>&nbsp;  expands the requirements of <a href="/doc/rfc5654/">RFC 5654</a> "Requirements for the Transport Profile <br>&nbsp;  of MPLS" and <a href="/doc/rfc6372/">RFC 6372</a> "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Survivability<br>&nbsp;  Framework". <br><br>&nbsp;  The intention is that this document shall be used when defining mechanisms that <br>&nbsp;  use SMP to implement protection for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that<br>&nbsp;  delegate executive action for resiliency to the data plane.<br><br>Working Group Summary<br><br>&nbsp; Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For <br>&nbsp; example, was there controversy about particular points or <br>&nbsp; were there decisions where the consensus was particularly <br>&nbsp; rough?<br><br>&nbsp;  The history of MPLS-TP SMP includes starting out with a number<br>&nbsp;  of solution drafts, some which were fairly quickly merged, but we failed<br>&nbsp;  to merge all solutions into a single document.<br><br>&nbsp;  The advice from the working group chairs at this point was to start with<br>&nbsp;  a requirement specification. The current document is the result of that <br>&nbsp;  process and includes authors from across the solutions drafts.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document has been well discussed in the part of the MPLS WG that<br>&nbsp;  is interested in MPLS-TP style protection. <br><br>&nbsp;  The only "out of the ordinary" thing that has happened is that at one point<br>&nbsp;  in time some of the authors told me that "the document is ready for wglc".<br>&nbsp;  In preparation for the wglc the shepherd started an IPR poll saying:<br><br>&nbsp;  "The authors of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements/">draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements</a> have told the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; working group chairs that the draft is ready to be working<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group last called.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before starting the the wglc we need to do an IPR poll."<br><br>&nbsp;  Resulting in that one author and one contributor notified the shepherd that <br>&nbsp;  they did not believe the document was ready to go!<br><br>&nbsp;  Well - this was sorted out and all comments addressed.<br><br>Document Quality<br><br>&nbsp; This document is a requirement specification, and as such is not possible<br>&nbsp;  to implement. It has been claimed in the discussion that led up to merging<br>&nbsp;  solutions documents and requirement that some of the existing MPLS-TP<br>&nbsp;  protection implementations fulfill the requirements in this draft.<br><br>&nbsp;  The discussion on implementations will be revisited if and when we see<br>&nbsp;  solutions addressing the requirements in this document being put forward.<br><br>Personnel<br><br>&nbsp; Who is the Document Shepherd? Who is the Responsible Area<br>&nbsp; Director?<br><br>&nbsp;  Loa Andersson is the Document Shepherd.<br>&nbsp;  Adrian Farrel is the Responsible AD<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.&nbsp; If this version of the document is not ready<br>for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to<br>the IESG.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd believes this document is ready for publication<br>&nbsp;  as an Informational RFC. Since the ITU-T SG15 is interested to use it as<br>&nbsp;  a reference, it should go through IETF Last Call.<br><br>&nbsp;  The document shepherd has reviewed this and related documents several<br>&nbsp;  times since the discussion on MPLS-TP shared mesh protection started<br>&nbsp;  in 2010. The Shepherd has also been participating in the efforts to merge<br>&nbsp;  the solutions document and establish requirement document.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Shepherd has the impression that there is a strong vendor and operator<br>&nbsp;  interest in this area, and that this set of requirements represents a least<br>&nbsp;  common denominator.<br><br>&nbsp;  The Document Shepherd reviewed the document prior to the WG Adoption poll<br>&nbsp;  and prior to wglc. When preparing the Shepherd Write-up for version -04, the<br>&nbsp;  document shepherd decided that a langue review were needed and version<br>&nbsp;  -05 is the result of this review performed by Matt Hartley.The language review<br>&nbsp;  has very much improved the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;  No such concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such review needed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No real concerns, the only thing is that the document need to go through<br>&nbsp;  an full IETF Last Call in order to be possible for ITU-T to use it as a <br>&nbsp;  reference.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp;  In the part of the working group that is interested in MPLS-TP protection<br>&nbsp;  the consensus is very strong, in the part of the working group more <br>&nbsp;  interested&nbsp; IP/MPLS FRR and by-pass, the document is less well reviewed<br>&nbsp;  but I'd say that based on the checks I've done no issues with progressing<br>&nbsp;  the document have emerged.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats!<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  All (normative) references are to existing RFC or to stable ITU-T<br>&nbsp;  Recommendations.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No downward references!<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no documents for which the status will be changed.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified.

If so, describe the review that<br>took place.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such review needed.<br><br>&nbsp;  The only "out of the ordinary" thing that has happened is that at one point<br>&nbsp;  in time some of the authors told me that "the document is ready for wglc".<br>&nbsp;  In preparation for the wglc the shepherd started an IPR poll saying:<br><br>&nbsp;  "The authors of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements/">draft-ietf-mpls-smp-requirements</a> has told the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; working group chairs that the draft is ready to be working<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; group last called.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before starting the the wglc we need to do an IPR poll."<br><br>&nbsp;  Resulting in that one author and one contributor notified the shepherd that <br>&nbsp;  they did not believe the document was ready to go!<br><br>&nbsp;  Well - this was sorted out and all comments addressed.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>&nbsp;  No real concerns, the only thing is that the document need to go through<br>&nbsp;  an full IETF Last Call in order to be possible for ITU-T to use it as a <br>&nbsp;  reference.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why.<br><br>&nbsp;  All authors and contributors have stated on the working group mailing<br>&nbsp;  list that they are unaware of any IPR against this document.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?<br>If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>&nbsp;  No IPR disclosures filed against this document.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it <br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others<br>being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>&nbsp;  In the part of the working group that is interested in MPLS-TP protection<br>&nbsp;  the consensus is very strong, in the part of the working group more <br>&nbsp;  interested&nbsp; IP/MPLS FRR and by-pass, the document is less well reviewed<br>&nbsp;  but I'd say that based on the checks I've done no issues with progressing<br>&nbsp;  the document have emerged.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme <br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>&nbsp;  No such threats!<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>&nbsp;  The nits tools points gives on warning, an unexpected double-space<br>&nbsp;  on line 154. I think that this can be updated by the RFC Editor or if<br>&nbsp;  new revisions are needed down the line.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review<br>criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br><br>&nbsp;  No formal reviews required.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as<br>either normative or informative?<br><br>&nbsp;  There are only normative references.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br><br>&nbsp;  All (normative) references are to existing RFC or to stable ITU-T<br>&nbsp;  Recommendations.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?<br>If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in <br>the Last Call procedure. <br><br>&nbsp;  No downward references!<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any<br>existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed<br>in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not<br>listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the<br>part of the document where the relationship of this document to the<br>other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document,<br>explain why the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no documents for which the status will be changed.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>&nbsp;  There are no IANA allocations in this document.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find<br>useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such registries.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br><br>&nbsp;  No such reviews performed.</div></td>
