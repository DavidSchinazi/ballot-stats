The shepherd writeup for this document says “It also received an RTG DIR review and cross-reviewed with the IDR working group”.

What are the potential error modes if the Prefix-SID attribute should be lost from the route, while the NLRI is retained?<br><br>(An obvious way of addressing this particular concern would be to define a new NLRI type with the desired semantics, instead of creatively repurposing fields within an existing NLRI type contrary to their definitions. Such an NLRI type would, for example, presumably state in its specification that if it was received without an accompanying Prefix-SID attribute, that would constitute an error.) <br><br>3. As Warren Kumari points out in his DISCUSS, “leaks happen”. Subsequent discussion turned quickly to the assertion that no, they don’t, in VPN address families. Let’s accept that claim for the sake of conversation. It’s still the case that sometimes (often?) routes are distributed from VPN address families into the Global Internet table. When this is done, by default, all the path attributes come along for the ride. Anyone who thinks this is just a hypothetical case might want to look back to (for example) significant network outages that were caused around a decade ago by leakage of BGP Attribute 128 (ATTR_SET, <a href="/doc/rfc6368/">RFC 6368</a>) into the global Internet.  <br><br>The SIDs contained in these if-they-were-to-leak routes potentially give an attacker a means of directing packets into a VPN customer’s internal network. <br><br>4. Speaking of Warren’s DISCUSS, the shepherd’s writeup indicates “solid [WG] consensus”; however, there doesn’t seem to be consensus even amongst the authors as to whether Sections 5.3 and 5.4 are appropriate. This is a fairly fundamental disagreement! An illustration of the disagreement is <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bess/K1JKxGn19BXALs3rUzUAaGTZi0Y/:">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bess/K1JKxGn19BXALs3rUzUAaGTZi0Y/:</a>  <br><br>“So I can see why some people may have thought oh since transport in SRv6 comes for free let's load it with services in an attribute and be done. Yes I can see that flattening this make it potentially easier (one less SAFI to enable), *but I am not sure we have reached a broad agreement here.* This comes as a consequence of moving service prefixes from MP_REACH_NLRI (perhaps new format and new SAFI) to an attribute.”  <br><br>(Emphasis added.)<br><br>It's of course possible for an author to be in the rough as regards consensus, just as any other WG contributor, but it's a little unusual, and this disagreement doesn't even seem to have been previously aired. For this reason, I have to question the strength of the consensus behind this document, and ask the WG chairs to weigh in regarding whether consensus on at least this point needs to be checked before we proceed forward. <br><br>5. Finally, I have to question the length of the author list. As I’m sure you know, the guidance is to limit author lists to no more than five, other than under unusual circumstances.

One area of concern I would have hoped IDR might have looked into is, the document makes a creative use of the MPLS Label field of the NLRI to carry the Function part of the SID.

As Warren Kumari points out in his DISCUSS, “leaks happen”. Subsequent discussion turned quickly to the assertion that no, they don’t, in VPN address families. Let’s accept that claim for the sake of conversation. It’s still the case that sometimes (often?) routes are distributed from VPN address families into the Global Internet table. When this is done, by default, all the path attributes come along for the ride. Anyone who thinks this is just a hypothetical case might want to look back to (for example) significant network outages that were caused around a decade ago by leakage of BGP Attribute 128 (ATTR_SET, <a href="/doc/rfc6368/">RFC 6368</a>) into the global Internet.  <br><br>The SIDs contained in these if-they-were-to-leak routes potentially give an attacker a means of directing packets into a VPN customer’s internal network. <br><br>4. Speaking of Warren’s DISCUSS, the shepherd’s writeup indicates “solid [WG] consensus”; however, there doesn’t seem to be consensus even amongst the authors as to whether Sections 5.3 and 5.4 are appropriate. This is a fairly fundamental disagreement! An illustration of the disagreement is <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bess/K1JKxGn19BXALs3rUzUAaGTZi0Y/:">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/bess/K1JKxGn19BXALs3rUzUAaGTZi0Y/:</a>  <br><br>“So I can see why some people may have thought oh since transport in SRv6 comes for free let's load it with services in an attribute and be done.

For this reason, I have to question the strength of the consensus behind this document, and ask the WG chairs to weigh in regarding whether consensus on at least this point needs to be checked before we proceed forward. <br><br>5.

I guess it is section 10.2. Moreover, IANA registries are usually referred to via their name/URL, e.g., <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/segment-routing/segment-routing.xhtml">https://www.iana.org/assignments/segment-routing/segment-routing.xhtml</a>, and not by a section of the RFC that created them.<br><br>## Section 3.2.1<br><br>Where is "locator node" defined ? "locator block" is defined in section 3.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> but not the node (I can only guess that this is the "N" in the "B:N" notation used in <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a>).<br><br>## Section 6<br><br>Section 9 of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy/16/">draft-ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy-16</a> indeed defines route types 7 and 8 but it uses non IPv4-only wording. So, s/IGMP join sync route/Multicast Membership Report Synch Route/ + same for type 8.<br><br># COMMENTS<br><br>## Section 1<br><br>More details on the encapsulation (plain IP in IPv6 ?) will be welcome in "The<br>&nbsp;  ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header where the<br>&nbsp;  destination address is the SRv6 Service SID provided by the egress<br>&nbsp;  Provider Edge (PE). "<br><br>## Section 3.2.1<br><br>The transposition field appears to be about "labels", which are not qualified. Should the reader assume that those are "MPLS labels" ? A reference to some text would be welcome. Not being a SRv6 expert (but somehow knowledgeable on the topic), all the text about transposition is completely opaque to me. <br><br>The section 4 appears to give some information, but there should at least be a forward reference to it in section 3.2.1 or even better the section 4 should be moved before section 3.2.1.<br><br>## Section 4<br><br>This section would benefit from examples &amp; figures.<br><br>While the specification probably works well, mapping a 128-bit IPv6 SID into what looks like a 20-bit MPLS label looks like a smart kludge (for compression efficiency) but still...<br><br>## Section 5<br><br>"...optionally insert an SRH [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] when required..." looks like an oxymoron to me, i.e., if it is required then it is no more optional. Same issue in other places (notably section 6).<br><br>5th § "the ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header", is it "payload" of the ingress packet or the whole packet itself ?<br><br>## Section 10<br><br>The protocol defined in this document is a sibling of the EPVN and other layer-3 VPN using BGP as a control plane. I would have expected to have a mostly identical security section. The similarity is indeed indicated in the 2nd § but this 2nd § would benefit by also giving the RFC titles rather than a dry list of RFCs.<br><br>The 3rd § appears a little self-contradicting to my reading. The first part rightfully confirms that SRv6 domain should be closed and makes reference to SRH and network-programming security sections, i.e., isolation/protection in the data plane. Then, the last part of this § is "Therefore, precaution is necessary to ensure that the BGP service information (including associated SRv6 SID) advertised via BGP sessions are limited to peers within this trusted SR domain. " which seems to contradict the first part. IMHO, the words "is necessary" is an overkill, something like "Precautions should be taken to ensure..." would be more appropriate.<br><br>To elaborate on the previous comment:<br><br>- isn't it *exactly* the same security issues as for EPVN and other BGP-based VPN ? So, already covered by the 2nd § ?<br><br>- even if there is yet-another BGP leak with SRv6 SID, then what are the consequences ? SRv6 data plane (as explained in the first sentences of this 3rd §) MUST be protected anyway and will protect the SRv6 domain completely, else the operator has more critical issues.<br><br>In short, readers will benefit from a shorter and clearer 3rd paragraph.<br><br>Final suggestion for the security section: what happens when the length of all sub-sub-TLVs exceeds the length of the sub-TLV ? And similar corner cases. This is of course more an implementation issue but should it be mentioned here ?<br><br>I note that the security directorate review result is "ready".</div></td>

I guess it is section 10.2.

"locator block" is defined in section 3.1 of <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a> but not the node (I can only guess that this is the "N" in the "B:N" notation used in <a href="/doc/rfc8986/">RFC 8986</a>).<br><br>## Section 6<br><br>Section 9 of <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy/16/">draft-ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy-16</a> indeed defines route types 7 and 8 but it uses non IPv4-only wording. So, s/IGMP join sync route/Multicast Membership Report Synch Route/ + same for type 8.<br><br># COMMENTS<br><br>## Section 1<br><br>More details on the encapsulation (plain IP in IPv6 ?) will be welcome in "The<br>&nbsp;  ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header where the<br>&nbsp;  destination address is the SRv6 Service SID provided by the egress<br>&nbsp;  Provider Edge (PE). "<br><br>## Section 3.2.1<br><br>The transposition field appears to be about "labels", which are not qualified. Should the reader assume that those are "MPLS labels" ? A reference to some text would be welcome. Not being a SRv6 expert (but somehow knowledgeable on the topic), all the text about transposition is completely opaque to me. <br><br>The section 4 appears to give some information, but there should at least be a forward reference to it in section 3.2.1 or even better the section 4 should be moved before section 3.2.1.<br><br>## Section 4<br><br>This section would benefit from examples &amp; figures.<br><br>While the specification probably works well, mapping a 128-bit IPv6 SID into what looks like a 20-bit MPLS label looks like a smart kludge (for compression efficiency) but still...<br><br>## Section 5<br><br>"...optionally insert an SRH [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] when required..." looks like an oxymoron to me, i.e., if it is required then it is no more optional. Same issue in other places (notably section 6).<br><br>5th § "the ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header", is it "payload" of the ingress packet or the whole packet itself ?<br><br>## Section 10<br><br>The protocol defined in this document is a sibling of the EPVN and other layer-3 VPN using BGP as a control plane. I would have expected to have a mostly identical security section. The similarity is indeed indicated in the 2nd § but this 2nd § would benefit by also giving the RFC titles rather than a dry list of RFCs.<br><br>The 3rd § appears a little self-contradicting to my reading. The first part rightfully confirms that SRv6 domain should be closed and makes reference to SRH and network-programming security sections, i.e., isolation/protection in the data plane. Then, the last part of this § is "Therefore, precaution is necessary to ensure that the BGP service information (including associated SRv6 SID) advertised via BGP sessions are limited to peers within this trusted SR domain. " which seems to contradict the first part. IMHO, the words "is necessary" is an overkill, something like "Precautions should be taken to ensure..." would be more appropriate.<br><br>To elaborate on the previous comment:<br><br>- isn't it *exactly* the same security issues as for EPVN and other BGP-based VPN ? So, already covered by the 2nd § ?<br><br>- even if there is yet-another BGP leak with SRv6 SID, then what are the consequences ? SRv6 data plane (as explained in the first sentences of this 3rd §) MUST be protected anyway and will protect the SRv6 domain completely, else the operator has more critical issues.<br><br>In short, readers will benefit from a shorter and clearer 3rd paragraph.<br><br>Final suggestion for the security section: what happens when the length of all sub-sub-TLVs exceeds the length of the sub-TLV ? And similar corner cases. This is of course more an implementation issue but should it be mentioned here ?<br><br>I note that the security directorate review result is "ready".</div></td>

"<br><br>## Section 3.2.1<br><br>The transposition field appears to be about "labels", which are not qualified. Should the reader assume that those are "MPLS labels" ? A reference to some text would be welcome. Not being a SRv6 expert (but somehow knowledgeable on the topic), all the text about transposition is completely opaque to me. <br><br>The section 4 appears to give some information, but there should at least be a forward reference to it in section 3.2.1 or even better the section 4 should be moved before section 3.2.1.<br><br>## Section 4<br><br>This section would benefit from examples &amp; figures.<br><br>While the specification probably works well, mapping a 128-bit IPv6 SID into what looks like a 20-bit MPLS label looks like a smart kludge (for compression efficiency) but still...<br><br>## Section 5<br><br>"...optionally insert an SRH [<a href="/doc/rfc8754/">RFC8754</a>] when required..." looks like an oxymoron to me, i.e., if it is required then it is no more optional. Same issue in other places (notably section 6).<br><br>5th § "the ingress PE encapsulates the payload in an outer IPv6 header", is it "payload" of the ingress packet or the whole packet itself ?<br><br>## Section 10<br><br>The protocol defined in this document is a sibling of the EPVN and other layer-3 VPN using BGP as a control plane. I would have expected to have a mostly identical security section. The similarity is indeed indicated in the 2nd § but this 2nd § would benefit by also giving the RFC titles rather than a dry list of RFCs.<br><br>The 3rd § appears a little self-contradicting to my reading. The first part rightfully confirms that SRv6 domain should be closed and makes reference to SRH and network-programming security sections, i.e., isolation/protection in the data plane. Then, the last part of this § is "Therefore, precaution is necessary to ensure that the BGP service information (including associated SRv6 SID) advertised via BGP sessions are limited to peers within this trusted SR domain. " which seems to contradict the first part. IMHO, the words "is necessary" is an overkill, something like "Precautions should be taken to ensure..." would be more appropriate.<br><br>To elaborate on the previous comment:<br><br>- isn't it *exactly* the same security issues as for EPVN and other BGP-based VPN ? So, already covered by the 2nd § ?<br><br>- even if there is yet-another BGP leak with SRv6 SID, then what are the consequences ? SRv6 data plane (as explained in the first sentences of this 3rd §) MUST be protected anyway and will protect the SRv6 domain completely, else the operator has more critical issues.<br><br>In short, readers will benefit from a shorter and clearer 3rd paragraph.<br><br>Final suggestion for the security section: what happens when the length of all sub-sub-TLVs exceeds the length of the sub-TLV ? And similar corner cases. This is of course more an implementation issue but should it be mentioned here ?<br><br>I note that the security directorate review result is "ready".</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br><br>This draft defines procedures and messages for SRv6-based BGP<br>&nbsp;  services including L3VPN, EVPN, and Internet services.&nbsp; It builds on<br>&nbsp;  <a href="/doc/rfc4364/">RFC4364</a> "BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)" and <a href="/doc/rfc7432/">RFC7432</a><br>&nbsp;  "BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN".<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The BGP Enabled Services (BESS) working group is responsible for<br>defining, specifying, and extending network services based on BGP. These services<br>have traditionally been deployed over MPLS networks. However, there is a need to be <br>able to implement them on new SRv6 based networks. A solution was needed to allow <br>the signalling of segment identifiers associated with layer 2 and layer 3 service endpoint <br>functions over SRv6. <br><br>This draft provides such a solution, including services such as IPv4 VPNs, IPv6 VPNs, and <br>EVPN. The document was developed over a period of time in the BESS WG, in parallel <br>with the development of SRv6 in the 6MAN and SPRING working groups. <br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>Segment routing using SRv6 is starting to be deployed. for supporting BGP based services between datacenters is becoming<br>widely deployed. The document is leverages relatively mature BGP extensions described<br>in a draft which is currently in the RFC editors queue. <br><br>The draft received a number of comments during WG last call which were addressed.<br><br>I have no concerns about the quality of the document. A number of participants have <br>indicated knowledge of implementations.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Document Shepherd: Matthew Bocci (<a href="mailto:matthew.bocci@nokia.com">matthew.bocci@nokia.com</a>)<br>Responsible Area Director: Martin Vigoureux (<a href="mailto:martin.vigoureux@nokia.com">martin.vigoureux@nokia.com</a>)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by<br>the Document Shepherd.

The draft was reviewed by a number of participants during WG last call<br>and comments addressed. It also received an RTG DIR review and cross-reviewed with<br>the IDR working group.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>No formal reviews required.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the<br>IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable<br>with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really<br>is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and<br>has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br><br>No specific concerns.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR<br>disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a><br>and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.

If<br>so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR<br>disclosures.<br><br>There are 3 IPR disclosures. There was no discussion on these in the WG.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it<br>represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being<br>silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>There is solid consensus behind the daft. There were a significant number<br>of participants who indicated support during the WG LC.<br><br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director.

Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed<br>in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of<br>the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs<br>is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why<br>the WG considers it unnecessary.<br><br>This document does not require a change to the status of any existing document.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes<br>are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.<br>Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly<br>identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a<br>detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that<br>allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a<br>reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).<br><br><br>There is one IANA action.
