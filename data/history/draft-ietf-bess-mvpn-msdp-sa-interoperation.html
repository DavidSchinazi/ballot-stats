 Section "14.&nbsp; Supporting PIM-SM without Inter-Site Shared C-Trees" of<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>] specifies the procedures for MVPN PEs to discover (C-S,C-G)<br>&nbsp;  via MVPN Source Active A-D routes and then send (C-S,C-G) C-multicast<br>&nbsp;  routes towards the ingress PEs, [...]<br><br>Just to check my understanding: when we say "send (C-S,C-G) C-multicast<br>routes toward the ingress PEs", does that refer to the "Source Tree Join<br>C-multicast route"s that <a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC 6514</a> describes?&nbsp; Would it be helpful to<br>write it out using the same terminology?<br><br>Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  When an MVPN PE advertises an MVPN SA route following procedures in<br>&nbsp;  [<a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>] for the "spt-only" mode, it SHOULD attach an "MVPN SA RP-<br>&nbsp;  address Extended Community".&nbsp; [...]<br><br>I don't really understand why this is only a "SHOULD".&nbsp; If the whole<br>point of this document is to let MVPN S-A announcements get propagated<br>out to MSDP, it seems required, and people who don't care about that<br>scenario can ignore the document entirely; they don't need SHOULD vs<br>MUST to get out of it.<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition to procedures in [<a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>], an MVPN PE may be provisioned<br>&nbsp;  to generate MSDP SA messages from received MVPN SA routes, with or<br><br>When would something that implements the rest of this document not be<br>expected to generate MSDP SA messages in such a manner?&nbsp; (That is, why<br>use "may be"?)<br><br>Section 4<br><br>I'm always a little wary of claims of "no additional security<br>considerations", though in many cases there are no *significant* new<br>security considerations, even if there are some considerations that are<br>new.&nbsp; In this case, we have the option of using the local RP address for<br>the C-G when constructing a MSDP SA message (when the EC is not present<br>in the MVPN SA NRLI), and since this causes different nodes in the MVPN<br>to see different RPs for the group, it's not immediately clear that<br>there are no relevant security considerations from having different<br>views of the RP.&nbsp; What is the behavior when different nodes are using<br>different RPs?<br><br>(There is also the fact that the address of the RP is now sent to a<br>larger population by virtue of being in the new BCP EC, which should<br>cause us to consider if there are any privacy considerations from the<br>broadedend information distribution.&nbsp; I don't see anything noteworthy,<br>though.)<br><br><a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC 6514</a>'s security considerations section mentions (by section number,<br>not name) that for the spt-only mode implementations should have an<br>upper bound on the number of SA A-D routes.&nbsp; IIUC, the mechanisms in<br>this document do not change relative resource consumption in a way that<br>might require the specific value of the upper bound to change, but<br>please confirm.<br><br>The security considerations for <a href="/doc/rfc3618/">RFC 3618</a> mandate implementation of<br>TCP-MD5, which is a bit dated.&nbsp; Should we say anything about TCP-AO (<a href="/doc/rfc5925/">RFC<br>5925</a>) here?<br><br>Section 7.2<br><br>While <a href="/doc/rfc3618/">RFC 3618</a> is not specifically cited in any location that would<br>require it to be classified as normative, I think that it should be<br>classified as normative, and thus presumably that more references to it<br>should also be added where the normative use of MSDP is mentioned in the<br>text.<br><br>NITS<br><br>Section 1<br><br>&nbsp;

I have a few questions and comments, below.<br><br>1. Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  The MVPN PEs that act as customer RPs or have one or more MSDP<br>&nbsp;  sessions in a VPN (or the global table in case of GTM) are treated as<br>&nbsp;  an MSDP mesh group for that VPN (or the global table).&nbsp; In the rest<br>&nbsp;  of the document, it is referred to as the PE mesh group.&nbsp; It MUST NOT<br>&nbsp;  include other MSDP speakers, and is integrated into the rest of MSDP<br><br>On first reading I had difficulty following “it MUST NOT include other MSDP speakers“. You mean, MSDP speakers from another VPN, right? It didn’t come together for me until I reread it and realized the referent of “it“ is “the PE mesh group“. Anyway, this confused at least one reader, it might stand a little rewording. (Replacing “it” with “The PE mesh group” in the last sentence would do the trick.)<br><br>2. Section 3<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition to procedures in [<a href="/doc/rfc6514/">RFC6514</a>], an MVPN PE may be provisioned<br>&nbsp;  to generate MSDP SA messages from received MVPN SA routes, with or<br>&nbsp;  without local policy control.&nbsp; If a received MVPN SA route is to<br>&nbsp;  trigger MSDP SA message, <br><br>There are a couple things wrong with the preceding clause. First, it’s either missing an article before “MSDP” as in “trigger an MSDP SA message” or possibly “message” is supposed to be pluralized as in “trigger MSDP messages”. Second and more troublesome, that “if... is to trigger” seems wrong, that’s normally a construct which would introduce a precondition but that’s not what happens. Can you reword this? Do you mean “if a received MVPN SA route triggers an MSDP SA message”?<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  it is treated as if a corresponding MSDP SA<br>&nbsp;  message was received from within the PE mesh group and normal MSDP<br>&nbsp;  procedure is followed (e.g. an MSDP SA message is advertised to other<br>&nbsp;  MSDP peers outside the PE mesh group).&nbsp; <br><br>Your use of “e.g.”, meaning “for example”, implies other things could happen instead as a result of normal MSDP procedure, and this is just a for-instance. Right? Just checking. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The (S,G) information comes<br>&nbsp;  from the (C-S,C-G) encoding in the MVPN SA NLRI and the RP address<br>&nbsp;  comes from the "MVPN SA RP-address EC" mentioned above.&nbsp; If the<br>&nbsp;  received MVPN SA route does not have the EC (this could be from a<br>&nbsp;  legacy PE that does not have the capability to attach the EC), the<br>&nbsp;  local RP address for the C-G is used.&nbsp; In that case, it is possible<br>&nbsp;  that receiving PE's RP for the C-G is actually the MSDP peer to which<br><br>“The receiving PE’s”<br><br>&nbsp;  the generated MSDP message is advertised, causing the peer to discard<br>&nbsp;  it due to RPF failure.&nbsp; To get around that problem the peer SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  use local policy to accept the MSDP SA message.<br><br>That sounds pretty gross considering the MSDP state is built dynamically (isn’t it?) but ok. <br><br>&nbsp;  An MVPN PE MAY treat only the best MVPN SA route selected by BGP<br>&nbsp;  route selection process (instead of all MVPN SA routes) for a given<br><br>“The BGP route selection process”<br><br>&nbsp;  (C-S,C-G) as a received MSDP SA message (and advertise corresponding<br>&nbsp;  MSDP message).&nbsp; In that case, if the selected best MVPN SA route does<br><br>“The corresponding”</div></td>
