It would help to define what is meant by "security" or "secure service."<br><br>-- Sec 7.4 and 7.5:<br>Both of these sections contain recommendations that are good, but seem out of place in this document unless they could be made more specific to port use. The ones that jumped out at me are:<br><br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt; New services SHOULD support security, either directly or via a<br>&nbsp;  secure transport such as TLS [<a href="/doc/rfc5246/">RFC5246</a>].<br><br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt; Insecure versions of new or existing secure services SHOULD be<br>&nbsp;  avoided because of the new vulnerability they create.<br>&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp;  &gt;&gt; Version support SHOULD be included in new services.<br><br>I would say to either remove these or add in the context of what they have to do with port number assignment (e.g., "Version support SHOULD be included in new services rather than relying on different port number assignments for different versions.")<br><br>-- Sec 7.7:<br>"Deployments that use port numbers before deployment complicate IANA<br>&nbsp;  management of the port number space."<br><br>I think this is supposed to say "before assignment" rather than "before deployment."<br><br>-- Sec 7.8:<br>""Squatting" describes the use of a number from the assigned range in<br>&nbsp;  deployed software without IANA assignment. It is hazardous because<br>&nbsp;  IANA cannot track such usage and thus cannot avoid making legitimate<br>&nbsp;  assignments that conflict with such unauthorized usage.<br><br>&nbsp;  Such "squatted" port numbers remain unassigned, and IANA retains the<br>&nbsp;  right to assign them when requested by applicants."<br><br>This is a little confusing -- is the first sentence supposed to say "unassigned range"? If not, what is the assigned range, and why is IANA said to retain the right to assign numbers that are already assigned? I would have thought squatting would be understood as using unassigned numbers in the system and user ranges.<br><br>"In<br>&nbsp;  particular, any unassigned code from the assigned ranges will be<br>&nbsp;  assigned by IANA, and any conflict will be easily resolved as the<br>&nbsp;  protocol designer's fault once that happens (because they would not<br>&nbsp;  be the assignee). This may reflect in the public's judgment on the<br>&nbsp;  quality of their expertise and cooperation with the Internet<br>&nbsp;  community."<br><br>This seems a little over-the-top to me. I would suggest:<br><br>"IANA may assign any code from the system or user ranges to applicants that meet all of the relevant criteria, and is not obligated to take into consideration the existence of squatters when doing so. Squatting is viewed as uncooperative behavior in the Internet community."</div></td>

However, most of these "compliance requirements" in the rest of the document are simply summary advice regarding what's going to be useful and what won't, so really what's in the "&gt;&gt;" is not a "compliance requirement", but rather an "Important Summary Note". I'd really prefer you call them that here.

If it wasn't for the last sentence in the above, I wouldn't have thought twice about it. So my two suggestions are:<br><br>- Change the text in section 2 to not call these "compliance requirements". If you don't like "Important Summary Note", choose something else.<br><br>- Change or delete the last sentence in the paragraph from 7.4. (I think delete is fine; it's repetitive anyway.)<br><br>7.4/7.5: I agree with Alissa's comments regarding the "&gt;&gt;" statements.

Overall I agree with its conclusions. But the way that it reaches those conclusions seems lacking or misguided in a couple of respects, so I'd like to discuss those.<br><br>The document argues that port numbers should be conserved and gives basically three reasons why (my summary):<br><br>1. Port numbers are designed for a specific purpose and conservation helps maintain that specificity.<br><br>2. The port number space is smaller than other number spaces.<br><br>3. Because of firewall and NAT interactions.<br><br>Reason (1) seems unobjectionable.<br><br>Reason (2) is true, but it doesn't really offer a compelling argument in light of the pace of assignments to date. The document indicates that about 11% of the port number space has been allocated over several decades. Does that really create cause to worry about running out of space? Are we suddenly being flooded with port number requests? If the rate of assignments doubled or tripled, would we worry about running out of port numbers? Again, I'm not saying this isn't worth pointing out, but in terms of making a compelling argument to developers about the need to conserve port numbers, I don't think this works.<br><br>That leaves reason (3), and in this case it seems like the document is making contradictory statements at times. On the one hand, many of the recommendations seem motivated by the fact that firewalls make judgments on the basis of port numbers, and therefore conservation makes firewall configuration easier and reduces application fragility that can arise from having some ports blocked. On the other hand, the document notes that port numbers should only be considered meaningful to endpoints and details some of the complications that arise when firewalls instead associate meaning to them. The message comes across as contradictory -- intermediaries are interpreting port numbers in all kinds of ways that they shouldn't, but we should take a conservative attitude towards port number assignment so that they can keep doing it.<br><br>I think it's totally fine to represent the state of affairs when it comes to how firewalls treat ports. But if that treatment is in some ways a perversion of the motivation for having port numbers in the first place (and if it wreaks some havoc on application development/deployment, which it does), I don't think it's appropriate for us to publish a BCP that predicates its recommendations on that perversion. <br><br>The upshot of these comments would result in some editing of sections 5 and 6, but I wanted to have the discussion before suggesting edits.</div></td>

If not, what is the assigned range, and why is IANA said to retain the right to assign numbers that are already assigned? I would have thought squatting would be understood as using unassigned numbers in the system and user ranges.<br><br>"In<br>&nbsp;  particular, any unassigned code from the assigned ranges will be<br>&nbsp;  assigned by IANA, and any conflict will be easily resolved as the<br>&nbsp;  protocol designer's fault once that happens (because they would not<br>&nbsp;  be the assignee).

It would be good to define the term in contrast to the port numbers for naive readers. The explanation of service names comes later, probably too late (just before the beginning of Section 6).

This version is dated 24 February 2012.<br><br>(1) What type of RFC is being requested (BCP, Proposed Standard, Internet<br>Standard, Informational, Experimental, or Historic)? Why is this the<br>proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page<br>header?<br><br>BCP<br><br>The document provides guidance to protocol and application designers on <br>best current practices for requesting and using ports; BCP status clearly <br>conveys the nature, importance and relevance of that guidance.<br><br>Some&nbsp; reviewers have noted that this application of BCP status<br>may not be aligned with their understanding of BCP status (<a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a>,<br>Section 5) and/or with current IETF usage of BCP status in practice.<br><br>Since this is intended to document best practice and design recommendations<br>for areas beyond TSV, the IESG should consider whether BCP status is <br>appropriate (e.g.,&nbsp; vs. Informational status).<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement<br>Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This document provides recommendations to application and service<br>designers on how to use the transport protocol port number space. It<br>complements (but does not update) <a href="/doc/rfc6335/">RFC6335</a>, which focuses on IANA<br>process.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>During document review the intended status was carefully considered. This<br>resulted in changes, omission of some material<br>and greater attention to the recommendations. This document is now thought<br>ready for publication by TSVWG.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>G Fairhurst (TSVWG Co-Chair)<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Spencer Dawkins (TSV AD)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd reviewed this document, and the recommendations that<br>it makes. The shepherd,<br>and TSVWG reviewers think this is ready to be published. The document does<br>impact other IETF Areas<br>and was therefore subject to cross-area review during the initial WGLC. I<br>am happy that the comments<br>received during this process have adequately been addressed in the current<br>draft.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>Yes - The material on allocation of secure and non-secure ports, the<br>discussion of firewall interactions, and other matters,<br>means that this draft contains significantly more security material than<br>is typical for TSVWG drafts.<br>The chairs therefore recommend a security directorate review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has<br>indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>No<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a><br>have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br>None are known<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document has been presented and discussed at IETF TSVWG meetings since<br>IEWTF-80.<br>Production of a document on this topic had the strong support of TSVWG<br>when adopted after IETF-86, March 2013.<br><br>The ID completed a first WGLC completing in June 2014 including cross-area<br>review requests to RAI, APPS, and SEC Areas, and comments<br>received from people within an outside TSVWG. Comments were also received<br>from IANA.<br>This resulted in changes to the style of presentation and to the<br>recommendations, including ensuring that<br>the relationship to <a href="/doc/rfc6335/">RFC 6335</a> was made more clear.<br><br>To confirm these changes the document subsequently had a second TSVWG WGLC<br>(14/10/2014, concluding 29/10/2014)<br>The second stage reviewers were D Black, G Fairhurst and E Lear. There<br>were no additional comments.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts<br>Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be<br>thorough.<br><br>Some references are marked by the tool as Obsolete, the document editor<br>and shepherd have reviewed these and checked these are correct.<br>As context, all obsolete references are cited in the section that<br>describes the history of ports. In many cases, the earliest occurrence<br>of an idea is cited in preference to later (in some cases obsoleting) RFCs.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,<br>such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>None<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>OK<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If<br>so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in<br>the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the<br>document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are<br>associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm<br>that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the<br>initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future<br>registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has<br>been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).<br><br>This document requires no actions from IANA<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future<br>allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful<br>in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.<br>None<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document<br>Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal<br>language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.<br>None</div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent<br>examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved<br>documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections:<br><br>Technical Summary:<br>This document provides recommendations to application and service<br>designers on how to use the transport protocol port number space. It<br>complements (but does not update) <a href="/doc/rfc6335/">RFC6335</a>, which focuses on IANA<br>process.<br><br>Document Quality:<br>During document review the intended status was carefully considered. This<br>resulted in changes, omission of some material<br>and greater attention to the recommendations. This document is now thought<br>ready for publication by TSVWG.<br><br>Personnel:<br>Who is the Document Shepherd?<br>G Fairhurst (TSVWG Co-Chair)<br><br>Who is the Responsible Area Director?<br>Spencer Dawkins (TSV AD)<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the<br>Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for<br>publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the<br>IESG.<br><br>The document shepherd reviewed this document, and the recommendations that<br>it makes. The shepherd,<br>and TSVWG reviewers think this is ready to be published. The document does<br>impact other IETF Areas<br>and was therefore subject to cross-area review during the initial WGLC. I<br>am happy that the comments<br>received during this process have adequately been addressed in the current<br>draft.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or<br>breadth of the reviews that have been performed?<br>No<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from<br>broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,<br>DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took<br>place.<br><br>Yes - The material on allocation of secure and non-secure ports, the<br>discussion of firewall interactions, and other matters,<br>means that this draft contains significantly more security material than<br>is typical for TSVWG drafts.<br>The chairs therefore recommend a security directorate review.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd<br>has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG<br>should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with<br>certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a<br>need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has<br>indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those<br>concerns here.<br>No<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures<br>required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a><br>have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br>Confirmed.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so,<br>summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures.<br>None are known<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent<br>the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or<br>does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?<br><br>The document has been presented and discussed at IETF TSVWG meetings since<br>IEWTF-80.<br>Production of a document on this topic had the strong support of TSVWG<br>when adopted after IETF-86, March 2013.<br><br>The ID completed a first WGLC completing in June 2014 including cross-area<br>review requests to RAI, APPS, and SEC Areas, and comments<br>received from people within an outside TSVWG. Comments were also received<br>from IANA.<br>This resulted in changes to the style of presentation and to the<br>recommendations, including ensuring that<br>the relationship to <a href="/doc/rfc6335/">RFC 6335</a> was made more clear.<br><br>To confirm these changes the document subsequently had a second TSVWG WGLC<br>(14/10/2014, concluding 29/10/2014)<br>The second stage reviewers were D Black, G Fairhurst and E Lear. There<br>were no additional comments.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme<br>discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate<br>email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a<br>separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)<br>No<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this<br>document.

In many cases, the earliest occurrence<br>of an idea is cited in preference to later (in some cases obsoleting) RFCs.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,<br>such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.<br>None<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either<br>normative or informative?<br>Yes<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for<br>advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative<br>references exist, what is the plan for their completion?<br>OK<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If<br>so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the<br>Last Call procedure.<br>No<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing<br>RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the<br>abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in<br>the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the<br>document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is<br>discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG<br>considers it unnecessary.<br>No<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations<br>section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the<br>document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are<br>associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm<br>that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.
