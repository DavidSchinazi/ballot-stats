Try this instead:<br><br>&nbsp;  The conference focus of a chat room MUST inform the MSRP switch of<br>&nbsp;  the chat room capabilities of each participant that joins the chat<br>&nbsp;  room in order to prevent the MSRP switch from distributing private<br>&nbsp;  messages to participants who do not support private messaging.<br><br>There are a few other examples of such superfluous uses below, but I'm sure I didn't catch all of them. Please review for places where the 2119 keyword is being used (incorrectly) for a description of the behavior instead of (correctly) for the protocol requirement.<br>&nbsp;  <br>6.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  The actual instant message<br>&nbsp;  payload MUST be included as payload of the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper<br><br>Silly MUST. Instead: "The payload of the 'Message/CPIM' wrapper will be the actual instant message payload."<br><br>&nbsp;  An MSRP switch that uses this fast forwarding procedure MUST<br>&nbsp;  temporarily store the Message-Id of the MSRP message to correlate the<br>&nbsp;  different chunks, as well as it MUST temporarily store the list of<br>&nbsp;  recipients to which the initial chunks were delivered.<br><br>Why does the switch have to store the Message-Ids and recipients? Is it so that it can figure out which recipients got which messages? If so, then these are not protocol requirements. In order to accomplish the protocol requirement ("SHOULD forward subsequent chunks only to..."), the switch "will need to" store these things.<br><br>&nbsp;  An MSRP endpoint that receives a SEND request from the MSRP switch<br>&nbsp;  containing a Message/CPIM wrapper SHOULD first inspect the To header<br>&nbsp;  field of the Message/CPIM wrapper.&nbsp; If the To header field is set to<br>&nbsp;  the chat room URI, it should render it as a regular message that has<br>&nbsp;  been distributed to all the participants in the chat room.&nbsp; Then the<br>&nbsp;  MSRP endpoint SHOULD inspect the From header field of the Message/<br>&nbsp;  CPIM wrapper to identify the sender.<br><br>Why SHOULD the endpoint inspect the headers? Again, I suspect that the *inspection* is not the protocol requirement. I'm not even sure I know what is in this paragraph.<br><br>6.2:<br><br>&nbsp;  Then the MSRP switch MUST inspect the To header field of the Message/<br>&nbsp;  CPIM wrapper.<br><br>Superfluous sentence, let alone superfluous MUST. Delete.<br><br>&nbsp;  Then the MSRP switch MUST verify<br>&nbsp;  that the To header of the Message/CPIM wrapper matches the URI of a<br>&nbsp;  participant of the chat room.<br><br>Same as above.<br><br>&nbsp;  Finally, the MSRP switch MUST verify that the recipient supports<br>&nbsp;  private messages.<br><br>Same as above.<br><br>&nbsp;  It is RECOMMENDED that the MSRP switch can map a<br>&nbsp;  URI to two or more MSRP sessions.<br><br>It is "RECOMMENDED" that the switch "can" do something? That doesn't make sense.<br><br>6.3:<br><br>&nbsp;  MSRP switches MUST follow the success report and failure report<br>&nbsp;  handling described in section 7 of <a href="/doc/rfc4975/">RFC 4975</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc4975/">RFC4975</a>], complemented<br>&nbsp;  with the procedures described in this section.&nbsp; The MSRP switch MUST<br>&nbsp;  act as an MSRP endpoint receiver of the request according to section<br>&nbsp;  5.3 of <a href="/doc/rfc4975/">RFC 4975</a> [<a href="/doc/rfc4975/">RFC4975</a>].<br><br>Wouldn't this be better as:<br><br>&nbsp;  The MSRP switch is an MSRP endpoint receiver of the report requests<br>&nbsp;  as described in section 5.3 of 4975 and will follow the report<br>&nbsp;  handling procedures described in section 7 of 4975, complemented with<br>&nbsp;  the procedures described in this section.<br>&nbsp;  <br>7:<br><br>First it says:<br><br>&nbsp;  Therefore, if a user joins the<br>&nbsp;  chat room under the same URI from multiple devices, he or she may<br>&nbsp;  request the same nickname across all these devices.<br>&nbsp;  <br>Then it says:<br><br>&nbsp;  This memo specifies the nickname as a string.&nbsp; The nickname string<br>&nbsp;  MUST be unambiguous within the scope of the chat room (conference<br>&nbsp;  instance).<br><br>These two statements seem like they are in conflict. I think a bit more explaining is in order. Can I use the same nickname across all devices or can't I?<br>&nbsp;  <br>7.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  This mitigates the problem of nickname duplication, but it does not<br>&nbsp;  solve a problem whereby users can choose similar (but different)<br>&nbsp;  characters to represent two different nicknames.&nbsp; For example, "BOY"<br>&nbsp;  and "B0Y" are different nicknames which can mislead users.&nbsp; The<br>&nbsp;  former uses the capital letter "O" while the latter uses the number<br>&nbsp;  zero "0".&nbsp; In many fonts the letter "O" and the number zero "0" might<br>&nbsp;  be quite similar, and difficult to be perceived as different<br>&nbsp;  characters.&nbsp; Chat rooms MAY provide a mechanism to mitigate<br>&nbsp;  confusable nicknames.<br><br>I don't see how this discussion is really necessary. Whether confusables are an issue at all is a completely implementation specific detail, not a protocol issue.<br><br>&nbsp;  In addition to preparing and comparing following the rules above, the<br>&nbsp;  MSRP switch SHOULD validate that the SIP AOR identifying the user is<br>&nbsp;  entitled to reserve the nickname.&nbsp; This may include, e.g., allowing<br>&nbsp;  that the participant's URI may use the same nickname when the<br>&nbsp;  participant has joined the chat room from different devices under the<br>&nbsp;  same URI.<br>&nbsp;  <br>The protocol requirement is not to validate that the user is entitled to reserve the nickname. The protocol requirement is that the MSRP switch SHOULD only allow the registration of a duplicate nickname if the same user that is currently using the nickname is making the second request. As written, this is confusing.<br><br>&nbsp;  If the MSRP switch is able to accept the suggested nickname to be<br>&nbsp;  used by this user, the MSRP switch MUST answer the NICKNAME request<br>&nbsp;  with a 200 response as per regular MSRP procedures.<br><br>MUST? No, I think that's a MAY. Why would it be a MUST?</div></td>
