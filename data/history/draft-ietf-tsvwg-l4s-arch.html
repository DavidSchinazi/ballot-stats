Assuming this is accurate, please add clear normative language that partial roll-outs of the L4S architecture MUST NOT occur outside of controlled environment until .<br><br>** Section 8.1.<br>&nbsp;  In the current Internet, scheduling usually enforces separation<br>&nbsp;  between 'sites'<br><br>If would be clearer to explain scheduling of what and by whom.<br><br>** Section 8.1<br><br>&nbsp;  However, there has<br>&nbsp;

 capacity.<br><br>I don’t follow the generalization being suggested here.&nbsp; Is the text suggesting that enterprises do not shape traffic on a per application basis?&nbsp; “Upstream networks” to provide different treatment of select traffic?&nbsp; Is there a measurement study that can be cited?<br><br>** Section 8.1.&nbsp; The first paragraph ends with a conclusion that there isn’t a universal need to police individual flow rates.&nbsp; However, the second paragraph then discusses the use of per-flow-queuing.&nbsp; One paragraph doesn’t follow from the other.&nbsp; If no one does per-flow treatment as suggested, why discuss the approach?<br><br>** Section 8.2<br><br>&nbsp;  It is hoped that self-interest and guidance on dynamic<br>&nbsp;  behaviour (especially flow start-up, which might need to be<br>&nbsp;  standardized) will be sufficient to prevent transports from sending<br>&nbsp;  excessive bursts of L4S traffic, given the application's own latency<br>&nbsp;  will suffer most from such behaviour. <br><br>Why is “self-interest and guidance on dynamic behaviour” the appropriate threat model?<br><br>** Section 8.2<br><br> None of these possible queue protection capabilities are considered a<br>&nbsp;  necessary part of the L4S architecture, which works without them <br><br>Could this be restated.&nbsp; The current text suggests to me that various security mitigations are not part of the L4S architecture.&nbsp; I don’t see how this would be possible if it were to see Internet deployment.<br><br>** Section 8.3<br><br>&nbsp;  So, in networks that already use rate policers and plan to deploy<br>&nbsp;  L4S, it will be preferable to redesign these rate policers to be more<br>&nbsp;  friendly to the L4S service. <br><br>It might be helpful to be more specific on where this traffic shaping is happening as part of the migration consideration.<br><br>** Section 8.4.&nbsp; This section discusses malicious senders, thank you.&nbsp; Could a statement also be made about an on-path attacker modifying the ECN marks in the absence of integrity mechanisms.&nbsp; For example, draft-ietf-tsvwg-l4s-ids notes in Section 5.4.1.1:<br><br>&nbsp;  If a non-compliant or<br>&nbsp;  malicious network node did swap ECT(0) to ECT(1), the packet could<br>&nbsp;  subsequently be ECN-marked by a downstream L4S AQM, but the sender<br>&nbsp;  would respond to congestion indications thinking it had sent a<br>&nbsp;  Classic packet.&nbsp; This could result in the flow yielding excessively<br>&nbsp;  to other L4S flows sharing the downstream bottleneck.<br><br>** Section 8.5. <br>&nbsp;  Because L4S can provide low delay for a broad set of applications<br>&nbsp;  that choose to use it, there is no need for individual applications<br>&nbsp;  or classes within that broad set to be distinguishable in any way<br>&nbsp;  while traversing networks.&nbsp;  <br><br>From a purely technical view, this might be true.&nbsp; However, couldn’t local policy require different treatment?<br><br>** Section 8.5.<br>&nbsp;  There may be some types of traffic<br>&nbsp;  that prefer not to use L4S, but the coarse binary categorization of<br>&nbsp;  traffic reveals very little that could be exploited to compromise<br>&nbsp;  privacy.<br><br>After L4S is more widely adopted, that specific application could be identified by their _lack_ use of L4S?&nbsp;

Just a few minor comments that can be taken into account or ignored.<br><br>## Comments<br><br>### Abstract<br><br>This is very very long. Perhaps some can be moved to the Introduction or cut? For example (but not having given it enough thought to actually use this): "This document describes the architecture for the "Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput" (L4S) protocol to archive lower latency traffic on the internet. It describes its design decisions to make it work via incremental deployment on the internet and in a worst case won't perform worse than currently deployed latency minimizing techniques."<br><br>### Security Considerations<br><br>&nbsp;  However, there has<br>&nbsp;  never been a universal need to police the rate of individual<br>&nbsp;  application flows - the Internet has generally always relied on self-<br>&nbsp;  restraint of congestion controls<br><br>The first voip clients on the internet in the 90s would blast UDP as fast as possible. ISPs started filtering it. I wouldn't call that self-restraint, but one might argue that they were forced to do so to remain in operation, so perhaps it qualifies a self-restraint :P<br><br>&nbsp;  Whether burst policing becomes necessary remains to be seen.&nbsp; Without<br>&nbsp;  it, there will be potential for attacks on the low latency of the L4S<br>&nbsp;  service.<br><br>If something can be abused to gain an advantage, it will be. So in that sense burst policing seems inevitable. But I can see how routers near the user could punish abusers to go into a slower queue and this section links to examples for that. So L4S won't really change this. Similarly, it can be used to create a two-tier internet ("premium users") but here too this can already be done without L4S.</div></td>

Probably worth updating the references.<br><br>### Multicast ?<br><br>While the answer seems obvious, should there be a mention that L4S technique only applies to unicast traffic ?<br><br>### <br><br><br>### Very long abstract...<br><br>This is probably the longest abstract for the last couple of months ;-)<br><br>No need to reply or change the document, but the abstract also somehow smells like a marketing text...<br><br>### Section 1, on purpose ?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  ... Queuing in access<br>&nbsp;  network bottlenecks is typically configured to cause overall network<br>&nbsp;  delay to roughly double during a long-running flow, relative to<br>&nbsp;  expected base (unloaded) path delay [BufferSize].<br>```<br><br>Is this really configured so on purpose ? Probably not, even if the above text seems to indicate that this is on purpose.<br><br>### Section 1, TCP only ?<br><br>The following text seems to indicate that TCP is the major transport protocol, but (see caveat about my lack of transport expertise) it seems to me that QUIC (and plain UDP) are becoming more important:<br>```<br>&nbsp;  The root of the problem is the presence of standard TCP congestion<br>&nbsp;  control (Reno [<a href="/doc/rfc5681/">RFC5681</a>]) or compatible variants (e.g. TCP<br>&nbsp;  Cubic [<a href="/doc/rfc8312/">RFC8312</a>]).<br>```<br>I.e., if similar mechanisms exist in QUIC, then it is worth mentioning.<br><br>### Section 2, incremental deployment ?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp;  ... Because ECN support is<br>&nbsp;  essential for L4S, senders use the ECN field as the protocol that<br>&nbsp;  allows the network to identify which packets are L4S and which are<br>&nbsp;  Classic.<br>```<br>seems to contradict the 'incremental deployment' statement as the network needs to be able to differentiate traffic. Or did I miss something ?<br><br>### Section 2, which part of the host ?<br><br>```<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... A host needs to distinguish L4S and Classic packets<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with an identifier so that the network can classify them into<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; their separate treatments. ...<br>```<br>I would assume that a host stack as a local API so that applications can signal L4S vs. classic traffic.<br><br>Also, it is unclear (to me) whether it is the sending part of the host or the receiving part ?<br><br>Finally, with some transport services (e.g., QUIC) moving to the user space, is the above statement still applicable ?<br><br>### Section 4.1<br><br>Unsure how `unassignment of an identifier` relates to item a) below.<br><br>### Section 6.1<br><br>Again, please bear with my lack of knowledge, but I wonder what is the 'load' in the text below. Is the 'load' only interactive traffic (then I wonder how there could be no congestion) or is it a mix with non-interactive traffic (the proverbial SW upgrade, which can be delayed):<br>```<br>&nbsp;  With the L4S approach, the following existing applications also<br>&nbsp;  experience significantly better quality of experience under load:<br>```<br><br>### Section 6.3<br><br>This section could probably be extended as Wi-Fi &amp; satellite links have properties going beyond latency (e.g., packet loss).<br><br>For a non native English reader, the use of 'pole' is really hard to parse.<br><br>### Section 8.1 and others<br><br>I wonder whether this section belongs to security considerations or rather to deployment considerations.<br><br>### Section 8.4<br><br>The text does not convince me that ECN can be trusted (i.e., the network provides ECN integrity). Should there simply be some text about 'best effort' ?<br><br>### Privacy considerations<br><br>Does the use of visible ECN marking leak some information about its (potentially encrypted) content ?<br><br>## NITS<br><br>### E.g. comma<br><br>AFAIK, all 'e.g.' must be followed by a comma.<br><br>### Spec<br><br>Suggest to use 'specification' rather than 'spec' ;-)<br><br>## Notes<br><br>This review is in the ["IETF Comments" Markdown format][ICMF], You can use the<br>[`ietf-comments` tool][ICT] to automatically convert this review into<br>individual GitHub issues. <br><br>[ICMF]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments/blob/main/format.md</a><br>[ICT]: <a href="https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments">https://github.com/mnot/ietf-comments</a><br><br><br>************* <br>As noted in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/">https://www.ietf.org/blog/handling-iesg-ballot-positions/</a>, a<br>DISCUSS ballot is a request to have a discussion; I really think that the<br>document would be improved with a change here, but can be convinced otherwise.</div></td>

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Informational.&nbsp; This is indicated properly and is the proper type of RFC since this describes the architecture for L4S, while other Experimental RFCs describe the transport behaviors for use of the L4S identifier and DualQ that is one of the possible queueing options compatible with this architecture.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable<br>&nbsp;  throughput (L4S).&nbsp; The insight on which L4S is based is that the root<br>&nbsp;  cause of queuing delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,<br>&nbsp;  not in the queue itself.&nbsp; With the L4S architecture all Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications could (but do not have to) transition away from<br>&nbsp;  congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,<br>&nbsp;  to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little<br>&nbsp;  queuing, aided by explicit congestion signalling from the network.<br>&nbsp;  This new class of congestion controls can provide low latency for<br>&nbsp;  capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve both high<br>&nbsp;  bandwidth and low latency.<br><br>&nbsp;  The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp;  defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion<br>&nbsp;  controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and<br>&nbsp;  throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller<br>&nbsp;  is usually much better (and rarely worse) than performance would have<br>&nbsp;  been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing<br>&nbsp;  flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not<br>&nbsp;  impacted by the presence of L4S.&nbsp; These characteristics are important<br>&nbsp;  to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S<br>&nbsp;  compliant network elements.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to<br>&nbsp;  isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that<br>&nbsp;  allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host support for<br>&nbsp;  L4S congestion controls.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>There were very specific technical concerns and disagreements with the other 2 L4S drafts (on the ECN usage and DualQ).&nbsp; Specific concerns related to the content of those drafts are discussed in their writeups.<br>- In this particular document there were some early objections related to use of the term "classic" for traditional non-L4S transports and queues, though no superior term was able to be agreed on, and only a small number of people seemed unhappy with "classic". <br>- More substantially, there were concerns raised about the overall state of development and study of the combined L4S architecture elements, particularly the compliant transport protocols.&nbsp; The TCP Prague reference code had some issues discovered (and fixed), and some of the working group participants did not feel like it was mature enough nor were the results of tests encouraging enough for them to support L4S advancing.&nbsp; Note that other L4S transports beyond just TCP Prague have been under development by other groups, who reviewed the L4S drafts and reported on their capabilities to meet L4S requirements with their transports.<br>- The selection of the L4S identifier (in the companion ecn-l4s-id document) is not specific to this architecture draft, but is at the root of a great deal of the lack of unanimous support.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.&nbsp; As a possible supplement for the limited ECN codepoints, the working group considered pros and cons of different means of using DSCP values, multiple times over the life of these documents.&nbsp; Some participants preferred approaches relying on DSCP, based on their view of the tradeoffs.<br>- Some of the objecting participants have proposed another technology (SCE) to enhance ECN differently, and incompatibly with L4S and this architecture.&nbsp; After careful consideration and a focused interim, the working group strongly supported the use of ECT(1) as an input to classification as in L4S to enable low latency traffic identification.&nbsp; SCE proponents propose that their alternative approach also can control latency, but make use of ECT(1) as an output to indicate finer-grained levels of congestion.<br><br>One potential mitigation for some of these concerns is that the TSVWG plans to be an open forum for experimenters to continue to present data and other findings, where the WG can ask questions, explore whether specific concerns have manifested, and discuss potential further development and advancement of L4S along the Standards Track.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are very minor ID nits that can be corrected during publication.&nbsp; These are the instances reported of non-ASCII characters and the outdated references to the other L4S documents.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes - all are informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>There are (correctly) no IANA considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A&nbsp; - there are no formal languages used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC8342</a>?<br><br>N/A.<br></div></td>

Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable<br>&nbsp;  throughput (L4S).&nbsp; The insight on which L4S is based is that the root<br>&nbsp;  cause of queuing delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,<br>&nbsp;  not in the queue itself.&nbsp; With the L4S architecture all Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications could (but do not have to) transition away from<br>&nbsp;  congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,<br>&nbsp;  to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little<br>&nbsp;  queuing, aided by explicit congestion signalling from the network.<br>&nbsp;  This new class of congestion controls can provide low latency for<br>&nbsp;  capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve both high<br>&nbsp;  bandwidth and low latency.<br><br>&nbsp;  The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp;  defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion<br>&nbsp;  controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and<br>&nbsp;  throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller<br>&nbsp;  is usually much better (and rarely worse) than performance would have<br>&nbsp;  been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing<br>&nbsp;  flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not<br>&nbsp;  impacted by the presence of L4S.&nbsp; These characteristics are important<br>&nbsp;  to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S<br>&nbsp;  compliant network elements.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to<br>&nbsp;  isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that<br>&nbsp;  allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host support for<br>&nbsp;  L4S congestion controls.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some resolutions were not unanimously agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple existing implementations of the technology described, and around 25 vendors and operators have indicated intentions to experiment with the overall L4S technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>There were very specific technical concerns and disagreements with the other 2 L4S drafts (on the ECN usage and DualQ).&nbsp; Specific concerns related to the content of those drafts are discussed in their writeups.<br>- In this particular document there were some early objections related to use of the term "classic" for traditional non-L4S transports and queues, though no superior term was able to be agreed on, and only a small number of people seemed unhappy with "classic". <br>- More substantially, there were concerns raised about the overall state of development and study of the combined L4S architecture elements, particularly the compliant transport protocols.&nbsp; The TCP Prague reference code had some issues discovered (and fixed), and some of the working group participants did not feel like it was mature enough nor were the results of tests encouraging enough for them to support L4S advancing.&nbsp; Note that other L4S transports beyond just TCP Prague have been under development by other groups, who reviewed the L4S drafts and reported on their capabilities to meet L4S requirements with their transports.<br>- The selection of the L4S identifier (in the companion ecn-l4s-id document) is not specific to this architecture draft, but is at the root of a great deal of the lack of unanimous support.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.&nbsp; As a possible supplement for the limited ECN codepoints, the working group considered pros and cons of different means of using DSCP values, multiple times over the life of these documents.&nbsp; Some participants preferred approaches relying on DSCP, based on their view of the tradeoffs.<br>- Some of the objecting participants have proposed another technology (SCE) to enhance ECN differently, and incompatibly with L4S and this architecture.&nbsp; After careful consideration and a focused interim, the working group strongly supported the use of ECT(1) as an input to classification as in L4S to enable low latency traffic identification.&nbsp; SCE proponents propose that their alternative approach also can control latency, but make use of ECT(1) as an output to indicate finer-grained levels of congestion.<br><br>One potential mitigation for some of these concerns is that the TSVWG plans to be an open forum for experimenters to continue to present data and other findings, where the WG can ask questions, explore whether specific concerns have manifested, and discuss potential further development and advancement of L4S along the Standards Track.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are very minor ID nits that can be corrected during publication.&nbsp; These are the instances reported of non-ASCII characters and the outdated references to the other L4S documents.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes - all are informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state?

If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed.

Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.

If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.&nbsp; In addition, both other TSVWG co-chairs have closely reviewed and commented on earlier revisions of the document.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>There were very specific technical concerns and disagreements with the other 2 L4S drafts (on the ECN usage and DualQ).&nbsp; Specific concerns related to the content of those drafts are discussed in their writeups.<br>- In this particular document there were some early objections related to use of the term "classic" for traditional non-L4S transports and queues, though no superior term was able to be agreed on, and only a small number of people seemed unhappy with "classic". <br>- More substantially, there were concerns raised about the overall state of development and study of the combined L4S architecture elements, particularly the compliant transport protocols.&nbsp; The TCP Prague reference code had some issues discovered (and fixed), and some of the working group participants did not feel like it was mature enough nor were the results of tests encouraging enough for them to support L4S advancing.&nbsp; Note that other L4S transports beyond just TCP Prague have been under development by other groups, who reviewed the L4S drafts and reported on their capabilities to meet L4S requirements with their transports.<br>- The selection of the L4S identifier (in the companion ecn-l4s-id document) is not specific to this architecture draft, but is at the root of a great deal of the lack of unanimous support.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this work, it was well understood that enhancing ECN involves tradeoffs in the choice of header encodings selected, since there are limited options in terms of the header bits, codepoints, and other fields like DSCP that can be leveraged.&nbsp; The working group went through a process of assessing the pros and cons of all of the options that were put on the table.&nbsp; The different weights that participants attach to the importance of these tradeoffs seems to be a major source of the inability to unanimously agree on the particular L4S usage of ECT1 (and CE).&nbsp; It was remarked in one WG meeting that we ideally would have 5 codepoints, but unfortunately need to live with 4 and engineer within that.<br>- Some of the objecting participants have proposed another technology (SCE) to enhance ECN differently, and incompatibly with L4S and this architecture.&nbsp; After careful consideration and a focused interim, the working group strongly supported the use of ECT(1) as an input to classification as in L4S to enable low latency traffic identification.&nbsp; SCE proponents believe their alternative approach also can control latency, but use ECT(1) as an output to indicate finer-grained levels of congestion.<br><br>One potential mitigation for some of these concerns is that the TSVWG plans to be an open forum for experimenters to continue to present data and other findings, where the WG can ask questions, explore whether specific concerns have manifested, and discuss potential further development and advancement of L4S along the Standards Track.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are very minor ID nits that can be corrected during publication.&nbsp; These are the instances reported of non-ASCII characters and the outdated references to the other L4S documents.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes - all are informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>There are (correctly) no IANA considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A&nbsp; - there are no formal languages used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable<br>&nbsp;  throughput (L4S).&nbsp; The insight on which L4S is based is that the root<br>&nbsp;  cause of queuing delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,<br>&nbsp;  not in the queue itself.&nbsp; With the L4S architecture all Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications could (but do not have to) transition away from<br>&nbsp;  congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,<br>&nbsp;  to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little<br>&nbsp;  queuing, aided by explicit congestion signalling from the network.<br>&nbsp;  This new class of congestion controls can provide low latency for<br>&nbsp;  capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve both high<br>&nbsp;  bandwidth and low latency.<br><br>&nbsp;  The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp;  defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion<br>&nbsp;  controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and<br>&nbsp;  throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller<br>&nbsp;  is usually much better (and rarely worse) than performance would have<br>&nbsp;  been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing<br>&nbsp;  flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not<br>&nbsp;  impacted by the presence of L4S.&nbsp; These characteristics are important<br>&nbsp;  to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S<br>&nbsp;  compliant network elements.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to<br>&nbsp;  isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that<br>&nbsp;  allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host support for<br>&nbsp;  L4S congestion controls.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>The working group largely supports and is enthusiastic about L4S technology, which this document is a part of.&nbsp; It was last called along with 2 other L4S documents.&nbsp; There is a wider than normal level of support that has been expressed for this work, but it is not unanimous.&nbsp; There are also some WG participants who have concerns about L4S or prefer an alternative approach.&nbsp; The working group had many long email threads and conducted several interim meetings focused on L4S, its goals, technical challenges, and concerns with the approach and potential impact on Internet safety.&nbsp; Full agreement was not obtained in all cases, but significant work was done to address the issues that were agreed upon, and each concern was considered in detail by the working group, even if some were not widely agreed with.<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple implementations of the architecture described in the document.&nbsp; Several vendors and network operators have indicated intentions to experiment with this technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>There was a combined last call for this and the other two main L4S documents.&nbsp; During that last call, it was clear that while a majority strongly supports the work and is eager to experiment with the technology, there are still also a number of participants who have concerns and/or prefer alternatives to L4S.&nbsp; The working group devoted considerable time, including multiple focused interim meetings in order to understand objections and try to address or mitigate all concerns.&nbsp; It is clear that while there are still some technical disagreements, there is a great deal of support and even wider than normal support for going forward with this work; spanning industry, including vendors, network operators, and congestion control researchers.<br><br>There were very specific technical concerns and disagreements with the other 2 L4S drafts (on the ECN usage and DualQ).&nbsp; Specific concerns related to the content of those drafts are discussed in their writeups.<br>- In this particular document there were some early objections related to use of the term "classic" for traditional non-L4S transports and queues, though no superior term was able to be agreed on, and only a small number of people seemed unhappy with "classic". <br>- More substantially, there were concerns raised about the overall state of development and study of the combined L4S architecture elements, particularly the compliant transport protocols.&nbsp; The TCP Prague reference code had some issues discovered (and fixed), and some of the working group participants did not feel like it was mature enough nor were the results of tests encouraging enough for them to support L4S advancing.&nbsp; Note that other L4S transports beyond just TCP Prague have been under development by other groups, who reviewed the L4S drafts and reported on their capabilities to meet L4S requirements with their transports.<br>- Some of the objecting participants have proposed another technology (SCE) to enhance ECN differently, and incompatibly with L4S and this architecture.&nbsp; After careful consideration and a focused interim, the working group strongly supported the use of ECT(1) as an input to classification as in L4S to enable low latency traffic identification.&nbsp; SCE proponents believe their alternative approach also can control latency, but use ECT(1) as an output to indicate finer-grained levels of congestion.<br><br>One potential mitigation for some of these concerns is that the TSVWG plans to be an open forum for experimenters to continue to present data and other findings, where the WG can ask questions, explore whether specific concerns have manifested, and discuss potential further development and advancement of L4S along the Standards Track.<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the Responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.) <br><br>Some participants may feel strongly enough against L4S to consider an appeal.<br><br>(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this document. (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts Checklist). Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be thorough. <br><br>There are only very minor nits noted for outdated document references, that can easily be fixed in conjunction with AD review comments.<br><br>(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria, such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either normative or informative? <br><br>Yes - all are informative.<br><br>(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state? If such normative references exist, what is the plan for their completion? <br><br>No.<br><br>(15) Are there downward normative references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)? If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the Last Call procedure. <br><br>No.<br><br>(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the abstract, and discussed in the introduction? If the RFCs are not listed in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is discussed. If this information is not in the document, explain why the WG considers it unnecessary. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document. Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>). <br><br>There are (correctly) no IANA considerations.<br><br>(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future allocations. Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries. <br><br>N/A.<br><br>(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, YANG modules, etc.<br><br>N/A&nbsp; - there are no formal languages used.<br><br>(20) If the document contains a YANG module, has the module been checked with any of the recommended validation tools (<a href="https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools">https://trac.ietf.org/trac/ops/wiki/yang-review-tools</a>) for syntax and formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is the justification for not fixing them at this time?

Why is this the proper type of RFC? Is this type of RFC indicated in the title page header? <br><br>Informational.&nbsp; This is indicated properly and is the proper type of RFC since this describes the architecture for L4S, while other Experimental RFCs describe the transport behaviors for use of the L4S identifier and DualQ that is one of the possible queueing options compatible with this architecture.<br><br>(2) The IESG approval announcement includes a Document Announcement Write-Up. Please provide such a Document Announcement Write-Up. Recent examples can be found in the "Action" announcements for approved documents. The approval announcement contains the following sections: <br><br>Technical Summary: (from abstract)<br><br>&nbsp;  This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable<br>&nbsp;  throughput (L4S).&nbsp; The insight on which L4S is based is that the root<br>&nbsp;  cause of queuing delay is in the congestion controllers of senders,<br>&nbsp;  not in the queue itself.&nbsp; With the L4S architecture all Internet<br>&nbsp;  applications could (but do not have to) transition away from<br>&nbsp;  congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,<br>&nbsp;  to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little<br>&nbsp;  queuing, aided by explicit congestion signalling from the network.<br>&nbsp;  This new class of congestion controls can provide low latency for<br>&nbsp;  capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve both high<br>&nbsp;  bandwidth and low latency.<br><br>&nbsp;  The architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment.&nbsp; It<br>&nbsp;  defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion<br>&nbsp;  controls to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared<br>&nbsp;  network.&nbsp; These mechanisms aim to ensure that the latency and<br>&nbsp;  throughput performance using an L4S-compliant congestion controller<br>&nbsp;  is usually much better (and rarely worse) than performance would have<br>&nbsp;  been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing<br>&nbsp;  flows continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not<br>&nbsp;  impacted by the presence of L4S.&nbsp; These characteristics are important<br>&nbsp;  to encourage adoption of L4S congestion control algorithms and L4S<br>&nbsp;  compliant network elements.<br><br>&nbsp;  The L4S architecture consists of three components: network support to<br>&nbsp;  isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic; protocol features that<br>&nbsp;  allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host support for<br>&nbsp;  L4S congestion controls.<br><br>Working Group Summary:<br><br>Was there anything in WG process that is worth noting? For example, was there controversy about particular points or were there decisions where the consensus was particularly rough? <br><br>TODO<br><br>Document Quality:<br><br>There are multiple implementations of the architecture described in the document.&nbsp; Several vendors and network operators have indicated intentions to experiment with this technology.<br><br>Personnel:<br><br>Wesley Eddy is the document shepherd and Martin Duke is the responsible AD.<br><br>(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by the Document Shepherd. If this version of the document is not ready for publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the IESG. <br><br>I have reviewed the document myself, and believe it is ready for publication.<br><br>(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or breadth of the reviews that have been performed? <br><br>No concerns.<br><br>(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS, DHCP, XML, or internationalization? If so, describe the review that took place. <br><br>Since the document deals with transport, congestion control, packet marking, and queuing behavior, there can be security, operations, internet, and routing area interests.&nbsp; There has been a healthy mix of academic, industry/vendor, and operator participation in this work, and a breadth of reviews have been incorporated.<br><br>(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG should be aware of? For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a need for it. In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those concerns here. <br><br>There are no personal concerns of my own.&nbsp; However, there have been concerns raised in the working group, discussed in question 9 below.<br><br>(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed. If not, explain why?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document? If so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR disclosures. <br><br>No.<br><br>(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document? Does it represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it? <br><br>TODO<br><br>(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent?
