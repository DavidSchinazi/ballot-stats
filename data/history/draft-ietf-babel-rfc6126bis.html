However, there are references to the appendix in all relevant places in the spec now and I'm okay to clear my discuss on this basis.<br><br>Please note that the following comment from my discuss ballot is not fully addressed:<br>"In section 4.1.1 the update interval needs a lower limit (e.g. 3 seconds) and a recommend default value would be could as well (Note that there are other part in section 3 where the update value is discussed as well)."<br>We had a long discuss about this value specifically and the recommended default in the appendix is fine with me. However, section 4.1.1 does not have a pointer to the appendix. Further I think it would be appropriate to add a warning here that low values mean higher network load which can have a negative impact in certain networks.<br><br>-------------------------------<br>Old comments (here for the record; didn't check these points):<br><br>1) While this point might not raise discuss-level, it would probably also be good to provide more concrete advise on how to implement jitter:<br>Sec 3.1.: “&nbsp;  A moderate amount of jitter may be applied to packets sent by a Babel<br>&nbsp;  speaker: outgoing TLVs are buffered and SHOULD be sent with a small<br>&nbsp;  random delay.”<br>Sec 4: “a Babel node SHOULD<br>&nbsp;  buffer every TLV and delay sending a packet by a small, randomly<br>&nbsp;  chosen delay [JITTER].”<br><br>2) Sec 4.1.2. (Router-Id) should probably state again that the router-id is assumed to be unique within a domain.<br><br>3) Sec 4: “The most-significant bit of the sub-TLV, called the mandatory bit,<br>&nbsp;  indicates how to handle unknown sub-TLVs.”<br>I would recommend to also indicate this bit in the image.<br><br>4) Sec 4.4:<br>“If a TLV has a self-terminating format, then it MAY<br>&nbsp;  allow a sequence of sub-TLVs to follow the body.”<br>Initially I wasn’t quite sure what you wanted to say here. I guess you say that the length would indicate a larger value that needed for the body and therefore a subTLV might be present? I recommend to clarify this here a bit.<br><br>5) I recommend to move Appendix C (Considerations for protocol extensions) in the body of the document.</div></td>

 the same algorithm is executed for all sources.<br><br>Just to check my understanding: this "source S" is a source of routing<br>information, not a source of data-plane traffic being routed?<br><br>Section 2.4<br><br>Is there a reference for AODV?<br><br>&nbsp;  To show that this feasibility condition still guarantees loop-<br>&nbsp;  freedom, recall that at the time when A accepts an update from B, the<br>&nbsp;  metric D(B) announced by B is no smaller than FD(B); since it is<br>&nbsp;  smaller than FD(A), at that point in time FD(B) &lt; FD(A).&nbsp; Since this<br>&nbsp;  property is preserved when A sends updates, it remains true at all<br>&nbsp;  times, which ensures that the forwarding graph has no loops.<br><br>I'm trying to walk through this and missing a step or two.&nbsp; "the metric<br>D(B) announced by B is no smaller than FD(B)" is pretty clear, since<br>FD(B) is just the minimum value of D(B) over time thus far.&nbsp; But I'm not<br>sure I follow how A can preserve the property FD(B) &lt; FD(A) when A sends<br>updates.&nbsp; Clearly FD(B(T')) &lt;= FD(B(T0)) for any time T' after T0, but<br>suppose FD(B) remains constant but A is off interacting with some other<br>node C and finds a great path via C, which correspondingly causes D(A)<br>to reduce.&nbsp; Can I get into a situation where<br>D(A) &lt; FD(B) &lt;= D(A) + C(A,B) (and thus, the subsequent<br>FD(A) &lt; FD(B) &lt;= FD(A) + C(A,B)) if A does not interact with B during<br>that time?<br><br>Section 2.5<br><br>Using the minusculeu and majuscule forms of the same letter to mean<br>different things (e.g., source S and sequence number s) is something of<br>a readability anti-pattern.<br><br>Section 3.2.6<br><br>It would probably be helpful to readers to note that "neighbor that<br>advertised" and "next-hop" can be different due to being different<br>address families.&nbsp; (For the same address family, they are generally<br>going to be the same, modulo weird network-layer technologies, right?)<br><br>Section 3.5.1<br><br>(side note: I got a bit confused reading this section and had to go<br>double-check several definitions, due to the qualitative difference<br>between the "metric" and "metric'" under comparison.&nbsp; Namely, the<br>"metric" is for the path from neighbor to S, but the "metric'" is for<br>the path from the current node to S, and so in some sense they are<br>"measuring different things".&nbsp; Perhaps using "FD" instead of "metric'"<br>would help disambiguate.&nbsp;

 the exact procedure is given in Section 3.7.3.<br><br>nit: this is a comma splice.<br><br>Section 3.5.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Note that while strict monotonicity is essential to the integrity of<br>&nbsp;  the network (persistent routing loops may arise if it is not<br>&nbsp;  satisfied), left distributivity is not: if it is not satisfied, Babel<br>&nbsp;  will still converge to a loop-free configuration, but might not reach<br>&nbsp;  a global optimum (in fact, a global optimum may not even exist).<br><br>I might even go so far as to say that a global optimum "will likely not<br>exist", though this is fairly qualitative/intuitive since we don't<br>define a configuration space or metric over it in which to evaluate the<br>probability.<br><br>Section 3.5.4<br><br>We don't seem to use the "link cost value equal to cost" anywhere in<br>this section, so maybe it is superfluous.<br><br>&nbsp;  If such an entry exists:<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; if the entry is currently selected, the update is unfeasible, and<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the router-id of the update is equal to the router-id of the<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entry, then the update MAY be ignored;<br><br>I guess the idea is that we can keep the old one around until it would<br>time out, since the initial timeout value for it means it should still<br>be workable until our timer expires, but it's only a MAY in case we want<br>to be more proactive about noticing that the advertised metric is now<br>unfeasible?&nbsp; It might be worth saying a bit about when we might/might<br>not want to heed the MAY.<br><br>Section 3.5.5<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; sending a retraction with an acknowledgment request (Section 3.3)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to every reachable neighbour that has not explicitly retracted<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prefix P and waiting for all acknowledgments.<br><br>nit(?): I'd suggest a comma before "and waiting for all<br>acknowledgments", since that's the final gating factor to achieve the<br>goal.<br><br>&nbsp;  The former option is simpler and ensures that at that point, any<br>&nbsp;  routes for prefix P pointing at the current node have expired.<br>&nbsp;  However, since the expiry time can be as high as a few minutes, doing<br>&nbsp;  that prevents automatic aggregation by creating spurious black-holes<br>&nbsp;  for aggregated routes.&nbsp; The latter option is RECOMMENDED as it<br>&nbsp;  dramatically reduces the time for which a prefix is unreachable in<br>&nbsp;  the presence of aggregated routes.<br><br>nit: I don't think this "prevents automatic aggregation" at a technical<br>level, but rather that it "makes automatic aggregation rather unusable<br>in practice" since if automatic aggregation is used, any route<br>retraction will result in a spurious blackhole for the (minutes) expiry<br>time, which is unacceptable for most environments.<br><br>Section 3.7<br><br>&nbsp;  Additionally, in order to ensure that any black-holes are reliably<br>&nbsp;  cleared in a timely manner, a Babel node sends retractions (updates<br>&nbsp;  with an infinite metric) for any recently retracted prefixes.<br><br>Is the sending of retractions the one described by the SHOULDs in 3.7.2?<br>If so, I'm not sure that "a Babel node sends retractions for any<br>recently retracted prefixes" is quite accurate (since SHOULD is not a<br>mandatory requirement); "can send" or "will generally send" might be<br>better.<br><br>Section 3.7.1<br><br>&nbsp;  Every Babel speaker periodically advertises all of its selected<br>&nbsp;  routes on all of its interfaces, including any recently retracted<br>&nbsp;  routes.&nbsp; Since Babel doesn't suffer from routing loops (there is no<br>&nbsp;  "counting to infinity") and relies heavily on triggered updates<br>&nbsp;  (Section 3.7.2), this full dump only needs to happen infrequently.<br><br>Part of the need for the full dump stems from the potential for<br>unreliable links, right?&nbsp; Do we want to mention that relationship here,<br>(and that if there are particularly unreliable links the frequency may<br>need to be more often)?<br><br>Section 3.8.1.2<br><br>We haven't introduced "hop count" yet and just mention it in passing<br>here as "[if the] hop count is 2 or more".<br><br>Intuitively, it seems like the routr should send an update if the<br>router-ids match and the requested seqno is equal to the route entry's<br>seqno, but I don't see this case covered in the current text.<br><br>&nbsp;  o&nbsp; otherwise, if the node has one or more (not necessarily feasible)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; routes to the requested prefix with a next hop that is not the<br><br>nit: I think the parenthetical can just be "not feasible", as any<br>feasible routes in question would have matched the previous bullet<br>point.<br><br>&nbsp;  neighbours.&nbsp; However, if a seqno request is resent by its originator,<br>&nbsp;  the subsequent copies MAY be forwarded to a different neighbour than<br>&nbsp;  the initial one.<br><br>Is MAY the appropriate level of strength?&nbsp; Trying the same neighbor<br>would be effective if the original was unsuccessful due to packet loss,<br>but is it possible for a routing pathology to occur that directs the<br>request in the "wrong direction" with respect to a link or node failure?<br><br>Section 3.8.2.4<br><br>Is it worth giving some informal guidance about not sending multicast<br>wildcard requests if a node observes others doing the same around the<br>same time (or similar) to avoid the "serious congestion" issues?<br><br>Section 4.2<br><br>&nbsp;  A Babel packet consists of a 4-octet header, followed by a sequence<br>&nbsp;  of TLVs (the packet body), optionally followed by a second sequence<br>&nbsp;  of TLVs (the packet trailer).<br><br>Without mention of the 'body length' field here, a reader might be<br>confused at what distinguishes the body TLVs from the trailer TLVs.<br><br>&nbsp;  The packet body and trailer are both sequences of TLVs.&nbsp; The packet<br>&nbsp;  Ibody is the normal place to store TLVs; the packet trailer only<br>&nbsp;  contains specialised TLVs that do not need to be protected by<br>&nbsp;  cryptographic security mechanisms. <br><br>I think we need a more explicit statement that the body structure is<br>subject to change when security mechanisms are in use, to allow for<br>potential confidentiality-protecting cryptographic mechanisms.<br><br>Section 4.3<br><br>Length is still in octets, right?<br><br>Section 4.4<br><br>&nbsp;  Every TLV carries an explicit length in its header; however, most<br>&nbsp;  TLVs are self-terminating, in the sense that it is possible to<br>&nbsp;  determine the length of the body without reference to the explicit<br>&nbsp;  Length field.&nbsp; If a TLV has a self-terminating format, then it MAY<br>&nbsp;  allow a sequence of sub-TLVs to follow the body.<br><br>This seems like a statement of fact, for which a lowercase "may" is<br>perfectly adequate.<br><br>&nbsp;  Sub-TLVs have the same structure as TLVs.&nbsp; With the exception of<br>&nbsp;  PAD1, all TLVs have the following structure:<br><br>I was going to complain that it's somewhat unfortunate to use the same<br>name for a thing that's a TLV and a thing that's a sub-TLV, even if they<br>have identical encodings.&nbsp; But then I noticed that in this (sub-TLV)<br>section we spell it "PAD1" and in the previous (TLV) section we spell it<br>"Pad1", which are different.&nbsp; On the gripping hand, Sections 4.6.1 and<br>4.7.1 both spell it "Pad1", which are the same.&nbsp; So a little bit of<br>effort rationalizing things would go a long way.<br><br>&nbsp;  The most-significant bit of the sub-TLV, called the mandatory bit,<br><br>Just to be clear: this is the MSB of the 'type' octet?<br><br>Also, for similar features in other protocols I've suggested the<br>clarifying language of "comprehension-mandatory" which seems to more<br>accurately reflect the corresponding behavior.<br><br>Section 4.5<br><br>&nbsp;  Since the parser state is separate from the bulk of Babel's state,<br>&nbsp;  and since for correct parsing it must be identical across<br>&nbsp;  implementations, it is updated before checking for mandatory TLVs:<br><br>nit: "mandatory sub-TLVs" (right?)<br><br>Section 4.6.2<br><br>&nbsp;

However, since these acknowledgment exchanges are<br>only between direct neighbors, it seems that they are only needed for<br>correlating responses to requests and not for unguessability.&nbsp; (In this<br>case it seems a sequence number would work just as well as a random<br>number, and we might want to discourage random assignment in the text to<br>avoid the risk of birthday collisions.)<br>On the other hand, multicast acknowledgment requests could be<br>problematic (and especially so when sequential nonces are used), and if<br>they are intended to be allowed then we may need to consider using a<br>larger and random nonce.<br><br>Section 4.6.6<br><br>I'm getting some sever cognitive dissonance between the "Rxcost" field<br>and the "carrying a link's transmission cost" statement.&nbsp;

<br><br>(1) It might be a good idea to explicitly mention/list which are these TLVs.&nbsp; There are some references in subsequent sentences, which may or may not be enough for most readers.<br><br>(2) There are some Normative actions applied to them, for example "MUST be sent in a timely manner".&nbsp; While the intent may be ok, the Normative enforcement of "in a timely manner" is not clear at all -- how do you comply with that?&nbsp; Appendix B says:<br><br>&nbsp;  The amount of jitter applied to a packet depends on whether it<br>&nbsp;  contains any urgent TLVs or not (Section 3.1).&nbsp; Urgent triggered<br>&nbsp;  updates and urgent requests are delayed by no more than 200ms;<br>&nbsp;  acknowledgments, by no more than the associated deadline; and other<br>&nbsp;  TLVs by no more than one-half the Multicast Hello interval.<br><br>I think it would help if this text is moved to §3.1 to make it explicitly clear what a timely delay is...and the text was changed to (something like) "MUST NOT be delayed more than 200ms".<br><br><br>(b) §3.2.2: "SHOULD NOT increment its sequence number (seqno) spontaneously"&nbsp; When it is ok to increase the seqno spontaneously?&nbsp; IOW, why not use MUST NOT?&nbsp; I think it would be better if there was a clear indication of when the seqno is increased.&nbsp; Scanning the rest of the document, it seems that those indications are in place.<br><br>(c) There seems to be no specific explanation of how the timers are handled, what happens when they expire, etc..&nbsp; For example, §3.2.4 includes this text:<br><br>&nbsp;  There are three timers associated with each neighbour entry -- the<br>&nbsp;  multicast hello timer, which is initialised from the interval value<br>&nbsp;  carried by scheduled Multicast Hello TLVs, the unicast hello timer,<br>&nbsp;  which is initialised from the interval value carried by scheduled<br>&nbsp;  Unicast Hello TLVs, and the IHU timer, which is initialised to a<br>&nbsp;  small multiple of the interval carried in IHU TLVs.<br><br>But there is no explanation (that I could find) about how to manage those timers.&nbsp; The only place where hello timers are mentioned is in Appendix A.1...but that is just an example.<br><br>(d) §3.7.2 includes two instances of "SHOULD make a reasonable attempt at ensuring that all [reachable] neighbours receive this update/retraction".&nbsp; What does making "a reasonable attempt" mean?&nbsp; How can that be Normatively enforced?<br><br>(e) §3.7.2<br><br>&nbsp;  Finally, a node MAY send a triggered update when the metric for a<br>&nbsp;  given prefix changes in a significant manner, due to a received<br>&nbsp;  update, because a link's cost has changed, or because a different<br>&nbsp;  next hop has been selected.&nbsp; A node SHOULD NOT send triggered updates<br>&nbsp;  for other reasons, such as when there is a minor fluctuation in a<br>&nbsp;  route's metric, when the selected next hop changes, or to propagate a<br>&nbsp;  new sequence number (except to satisfy a request, as specified in<br>&nbsp;  Section 3.8).<br><br>How much is "a significant manner"?&nbsp; What about "a minor fluctuation"?&nbsp; Are the modifiers (next hop change, for example) the only conditions to take into account, or are they just examples of when these significant/minor changes may occur?&nbsp;  How can these terms be Normatively enforced?<br><br>(f) §3.8.1.1: "When a node receives a wildcard route request, it SHOULD send a full route table dump."&nbsp; When is it ok to not send a full table dump?&nbsp; IOW, why is MUST not used?<br><br>(g) §3.8.2.1: "a node SHOULD repeat such a request a small number of times if no route becomes feasible within a short time."&nbsp; What does "a small number of times" and "within a short time" mean?&nbsp; How can that be Normatively enforced?&nbsp; Please be specific.<br><br>(h) §4.6.9: "Omitted...that should be taken from a preceding Update TLV in the same address family with the Prefix flag set."&nbsp; What if that Update TLV is not in the packet?<br><br>(i) Security Considerations<br><br>The initial vulnerability listed ("attacker can misdirect data traffic by advertising routes with a low metric or a high seqno") is only one of several actions an attacker can take.&nbsp; More importantly, if the attacker happens to be in control of an authenticated node, then the mitigation proposed doesn't help.&nbsp; This type of rogue node can, for example, set the mandatory bit in an unknown TLV (as in completely made up!) to cause whole TLVs to be ignored, resulting in loss of routes, etc..<br><br>I am not sure what can be done to mitigate this type of vulnerability...but I think it is important that it is at least called out.<br><br>(j) Are the appendices intended to be Normative or not?&nbsp; I'm assuming the answer is no...but I can base that only on the references in the text to Appendix A.*, pointing to them as examples.&nbsp; What about the others?&nbsp; They are not even referenced in the text.&nbsp; Some comments:<br><br>- Appendix B talks about constants/default values.&nbsp; See my DISCUSS comments above.<br><br>- Appendix C "is intended to guide designers of protocol extensions in chosing a particular encoding."&nbsp; I think is is valuable information.&nbsp; It would be very nice if there was a reference (or perhaps several, from where the different extensibility methods are presented) in the main body of the specification.&nbsp; I can see how this is an informative section.<br><br>- Appendix D defines a "stub implementation".&nbsp; This is also valuable information.&nbsp; But...there's no reference from the text, and Normative language is used...&nbsp;

It might be nice to indicate that...and avoid indicating that compression is not allowed where it can't be done anyway.<br><br>(n) <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">rfc8126</a> should be a Normative reference.<br><br>(o) Please include Informative references to <a href="/doc/rfc6126/">rfc6126</a> and <a href="/doc/rfc7557/">rfc7557</a>.<br><br>(p) s/Bellman-Ford protocol/Bellman-Ford algorithm<br><br>(q) §2.4: Include an Informative reference to AODV (<a href="/doc/rfc3561/">rfc3561</a>).<br><br>(r) §2.4: "if A has selected B as its successor"&nbsp;

I suspect the latter but this is ambiguous IMHO.<br><br>-- Section 3 --<br><br>It is unclear by reading "The protocol encoding is slightly more compact when router-ids are assigned in the same manner as the IPv6 layer assigns host IDs." whether EUI-64 is referred here. I also fail to see in section 4.6.7 (router-id TLV) what is the encoding benefit?<br><br>-- Section 3.1 --<br><br>Should there be a mention of maximum UDP datagram size? and some words on layer-3 fragmentation ? I understand that section 4 has a section on this, so, perhaps refer already to that section for completeness ?<br><br>-- Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 --<br><br>Does a dual-stack host have to send 2 hello? One on each protocol stack (v6 or v4) ? Unclear from the explanation.<br><br>-- Section 3.4.2 --<br><br>It is unclear to me whether a link to a neighbor (router-id) can have different cost based on the v6 or v4.<br><br>-- Section 4 --<br><br>Is there a reason why the well-known ports and multicast group addresses are not spelled out in this section ? They only appear in the IANA considerations section.<br><br>Also, should the hello be sent over v6 _AND_ v4 ?<br><br>-- Section 4.2 --<br><br>No a real comment, just an appreciation of your humor: "The arbitrary but carefully chosen value 42" ;-) you made my Monday morning !<br><br>-- Section 4.4 --<br><br>Is there any reason why the 'mandatory bit' does not appear in the packet structure?<br><br>-- Section 4.6.2 --<br><br>Is there any reason why the "MBZ" is not expanded ? Must Be Zero ?<br><br>-- Section 4.6.3 --<br><br>I wonder how the receiver could estimate the propagation time (in each direction BTW) + queuing time + whatever delay...<br><br>-- Section 4.6.7 --<br><br>Should the router-id field length be repeated here as well ?<br><br>== NITS ==<br><br><br>-- Section 1.1 --<br><br>Rather than using 'naive' to describe RIP, let's rather use 'trivial' or 'simple' ;-)<br><br>s/the routers involved participate/the involved routers participate/&nbsp; ?<br><br>-- Section 3.2.6 -- <br><br>Suggest to use '0xffff' rather than 'FFFF' and be consistent in the use of lowercase / uppercase for hexadecimal numbers.<br><br>-- Section 4.5 --<br><br>Parsing "since for correct parsing it must be identical across implementations" is not easy... a comma would be welcome.<br><br>-- Section 4.6.3 --<br><br>s/receiver send/receiver sends/</div></td>

There are multiple implementations.<br>&nbsp; Also, there are <a href="/doc/rfc6126/">RFC 6126</a> implementations not yet updated but<br>&nbsp; experience has shown these are easily updated to rfc6126bis.<br><br><a href="http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/babeld.html">http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/babeld.html</a><br><a href="https://github.com/fingon/pybabel">https://github.com/fingon/pybabel</a><br><a href="https://bird.network.cz">https://bird.network.cz</a><br><br>&nbsp; And a "reference" implementation, as well.

There are multiple implementations.<br>&nbsp; Also, there are <a href="/doc/rfc6126/">RFC 6126</a> implementations not yet updated but<br>&nbsp; experience has shown these are easily updated to rfc6126bis.<br><br><a href="http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/babeld.html">http://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/babeld.html</a><br><a href="https://github.com/fingon/pybabel">https://github.com/fingon/pybabel</a><br><a href="https://bird.network.cz">https://bird.network.cz</a><br><br>&nbsp; And a "reference" implementation, as well.
